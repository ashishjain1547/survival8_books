One CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>IT
was the last week of the Christmas term, and all the girls at <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">Gaylands</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">School</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
were looking forward to the Christmas holidays. Anne sat down at the
breakfast-table and picked up aletter addressed to her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Hallo,
look at this!' she said to her cousin <st1:place w:st="on">Georgina</st1:place>,
who was sitting beside her. 'A letter from Daddy - and I only had one from him
and Mummy yesterday.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
hope it's not bad news,' said George, She would not allow anyone to call her <st1:place
w:st="on">Georgina</st1:place>, and now even the mistresses called her George.
She really was very like a boy with her short curly hair, and her boyish ways.
She looked anxiously at Anne as her cousin read the letter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh,
George - we can't go home for the holidays!' said Anne, with tears in her eyes.
'Mummy's got scarlet fever •&gt;- and Daddy is in quarantine for it - so they
can't have us back. Isn't it just too bad ?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh,
I am sorry,' said George. She was just as disappointed for herself as for Anne,
because Anne's mother had invited George, and her dog Timothy^ to stay for the
Christinas holidays with them. She had been promised many things she had never
seen before - the pantomime, and the circus - and a big party with a fine
Christmas tree! Now it wouldn't happen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Whatever
will the two boys say?' said Anne, thinking<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>of
Julian and Dick, her two brothers. 'They won't be able to go home either.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well
- what are you going to do for the holidays then?' asked George. 'Won't you
come and stay at Kirriii Cottage with me? I'm sure my mother would love to have
you again. We had such fun when you came to stay for the summer holls,'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Wait
a minute - let me finish the letter and see what Daddy says,3 said Anne,
picking up the note again. 'Poor Mummy - I do hope she isn't feeling very ill.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
read a few more lines and then gave such a delighted exclamation that George
and the other girls waited impatiently for her to explain.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'George!
We are to come to you again - but oh blow, blow, blow! - we've got to have a
tutor for the holls, partly to look after us so that your mother doesn't have
too much bother with us, and partly because both Julian and Dick have been ill
with 'flu twice this term, and have got behind in their work.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'A
tutor! How sickening! That means I'll have to do lessons too, I'll bet!' said
George, in dismay. 'When my mother and father see my report I guess they'll
find out how little I know. After all, this is the first time I've ever been to
a proper school, and there are heaps of things I don't know.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'What
horrid holls they'll be, if we have a tutor running after us all the time,'
said Anne, gloomily. 'I expect I'll have quite a good report, because I've done
well in the exams - but it won't be any fun for me not doing lessons with you
three in the holls. Though, of course,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
could go off with Timothy, I suppose. He won't be doing lessons!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Yes,
he will,' said George, at once. She could not bear the idea of her beloved dog
Timothy going off each morning with Anne, whilst she, George, sat and worked
hard with Julian and Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Timothy
can't do lessons, don't be silly, George,' said Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'He
can sit under my feet whilst I'm doing them,' said George. 'It will be a great
help to feel him there. For goodness' sake eat up your sausages, Anne. We've
all nearly finished. The bell will go in a minute and you won't have had any
breakfast.' -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
am glad Mummy isn't very bad,' said Anne, hurriedly finishing her letter.
'Daddy says he's written to Dick and Julian - and to your father to ask him to
engage a tutor for us. Oh dash - this is an awful disappointment, isn't it? I
don't mean I shan't enjoy going to Kirrin Cottage again - and seeing <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Kirrin</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Island</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
- but after all there are no pantomimes or circuses or parties to look forward
to at Kirrin.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
end of the term came quickly. Anne and George packed up their trunks, and put
on the labels, enjoying the noise and excitement of the last two days. The big
school coaches rolled up to the door, and the girls clambered in.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Off
to Kirrin again!' said Anne. 'Come on, Timothy darling, you can sit between me
and George.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on"><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Gaylands</span></st1:PlaceName><span
 style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">School</st1:PlaceType></span></st1:place><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> allowed the children to
keep their own pets, and Timothy, George's big mongrel dog, had been a great
success. Except for the time when he had<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>run
after the dustman, and dragged the dustbin away from him, all the way up the
school grounds and into George's classroom, he had really behaved extremely
well.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I'm
sure you'll have a good report, Tim,' said George, giving the dog a hug. 'We're
going home again. Will you like that?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Woof,'
said Tim, in his deep voice. He stood up, wagging his tail, and there was a
squeal from the seat behind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'George!
Make Tim sit down. He's wagging my hat off!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was not very long before the two girls and Timothy were in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">London</st1:place></st1:City>, being put into the train for Kirrin.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
do wish the boys broke up today too,' sighed Anne. 'Then we could all have gone
down to Kirrin together. That would have been fun.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
and Dick broke up the next day and were to join the girls then at Kirrin
Cottage. Anne was very much looking forward to seeing them again. A term was a
long time to be away from one another. She had been glad to have her cousin
George with her. The three of them had stayed with George in the summer, and
had had some exciting adventuies together on the little island off the coast.
An old castle stood on the island and in the dungeons the children had made all
kinds of wonderful discoveries.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'It
will be lovely to go across to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Kirrin</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Island</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> again, George,'
said Anne, as the train sped off towards the west.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'We
shan't be able to,' said George. 'The sea is terribly<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>rough
round the island in the winter. It would be too dangerous to try and row
there.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh,
what a pity,' said Anne disappointed. 'I was looking forward to some more
adventures there.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'There
won't be any adventures at Kirrin in the winter,' said George. 'It's cold down
there - and when it snows we sometimes get frozen up completely - can't even
walk to the village because the sea-wind blows the snow-drifts so high.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oooh
- that sounds rather exciting!' said Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,
it isn't really,' said George. 'It's awfully boring -nothing to do but sit at
home all day, or turn out with a spade and dig the snow away.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was a long time before the train reached the little station that served Kirrin.
But at last it was there steaming in slowly and stopping at the tiny platform.
The two girls jumped out eagerly, and looked to see if anyone had met them. Yes
- there was George's mother!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Hallo,
George darling - hallo, Anne!' said George's mother, and gave both children a
hug. 'Anne, I'm so sorry about your mother, but she's getting on all right,
you'll be glad to know.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh,
good!' said Anne. 'It's nice of you to have us, Aunt Fanny. We'll try and be
good! What about Uncle Quentin? Will he mind having four children in the house
in the winter-time? We won't be able to go out and leave him in peace as often
as we did in the summer!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George's
father was a scientist, a very clever man, but rather frightening. He had
little patience with children, and the four of them had felt very much afraid
of him at times in the summer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh,
your uncle is still woiking very hard at his book,' said Aunt Fanny. 'You know,
he has been working out a secret theory - a secret idea - and putting it all
into his book. He says that once it is all explained and finished, he is to
take it to some high authority, and then his idea will be used for the good of
the country.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh,
Aunt Fanny - it does sound exciting,' said Anne. 'What's the secret?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
can't tell you that, silly child,' said her aunt, laughing. 'Why, even I myself
don't know it. Come along, now - it's cold standing heie. Timothy looks very
fat and well, George dear.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh
Mother, he's had a marvellous time at school,' said George. 'He really has. He
chewed up the cook's old slippers ...'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'And
he chased the cat that lives in the stables every time he saw her,' said Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'And
he once got into the larder and ate a whole steak pie,' said George; 'and
once...'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Good
gracious, George, I should think the school will refuse to have Timothy next
term,' said her mother, in horror. 'Wasn't he well punished ? I hope he was.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'No
- he wasn't,' said George, going rather red. 'You see, Mother, we are
responsible for our pets and their behaviour ourselves - so if ever Timothy
does anything bad I'm punished for it, because I haven't shut him up properly,
or something like that.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,
you must have had quite a lot of punishments then,' said her mother, as she
drove the little pony-trap along the frosty roads. 'I really think that's
rather a good idea!' There was a twinkle in her eyes, as she spoke. T<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Christmas
holidays<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>13<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>think
I'll keep on with the same idea - punish you every time Timothy misbehaves
himself!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
girls laughed. They felt happy and excited. Holidays were fun. Going back to
Kirrin was lovely. Tomorrow the boys would come - and then Christmas would
betheie!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Good
old Kirrin Cottage!' said Anne, as they came in sight of the pretty old house.
'Oh - look, there's <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Kirrin</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Island</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>!' The two looked
out to sea, where the old ruined castle stood on the little <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">island</st1:PlaceType> of <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Kirrin</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>
- what adventures they had had there in the summer!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
girls went into the house. 'Quentin!' called Geoige's mother. 'Quentin! The
girls are here.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Uncle
Quentin came out of his study at the other side of the house. Anne thought he
looked taller and darker than ever. 'And frowmer!' she said to herself. Uncle
Quentin might be very clever, but Anne preferred someone jolly and smiling like
her own father. She shook hands with her uncle politely, and watched George
kiss him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well!'
said Uncle Quentin to Anne. 'I hear I've got to get a tutor for you! At least,
for the two boys. My word, you will have to behave yourself with a tutor3 I can
tell you!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
was meant to be a joke, but it didn't sound very nice to Anne and George.
People you had to behave well with were usually very strict and tiresome. Both
girls were glad when George's father had gone back into his study.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Your
father has been woiking far too hard lately,' said George's mother to her. 'He
is tired out. Thank goodness his book is nearly finished. He had hoped to<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>finish
it by Christmas so that he could join in the fun and games - but now he says he
can't.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'What
a pity,' said Anne, politely, though secretly she thought it was a good thing.
It wouldn't be much fun having Uncle Quentin to play charades and things like
that! 'Oh, Aunt Fanny, I'm so looking forward to seeing Julian and Dick - and
won't they be pleased to see Tim and George ? Aunt Fanny, nobody calls George
Georgina at school, not even our Form mistress. I was rather hoping they would,
because I wanted to see what would happen when she refused to answer to
Georgina! George, you liked school, didn't you .•&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Yes,'
said George, -1! did. I thought I'd hate being with a lot of others, but it's
fun, after all. But Mother, you won't find my report very good, I'm afraid.
There were such a lot of things I was bad at because I'd never done them
before.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,
you'd never been to school before!' said her mother. I'll explain it to your
father if he gets upset. Now go along and get ready for a late tea. You must be
very hungry.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
girls went upstairs to their little room. 'I'm glad I'm not spending my holls
by myself,' said George. 'I've had much more fun since I've known you and the
boys. Hie, Timothy, where have you gone ?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'He's
gone to smell all round the house to make sure it's his proper home!'said Anne,
with a giggle. 'He wants to know if the kitchen smells the same - and the
bathroom - and his basket. It must be just as exciting for him to come home for
the holls as it is for us!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
was right. Timothy was thrilled to be back again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
ran round George's mother, sniffing at her legs in friendliness, pleased to see
her again. He ran into the kitchen but soon came out again because someone new
was there - Joanna the cook - a fat, panting person who eyed him with
suspicion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'You
can come into this kitchen once a day for your dinner,' said Joanna. 'And
that's all. I'm not having meat and sausages and chicken disappearing under my
nose if I can help it. I know what dogs are, I do!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timothy
ran into the scullery and sniffed round there. He ran into the dining-room and
the sitting-room, and was pleased to find they had the same old smell. He put
his nose to the door of the study where George's father worked, and sniffed
very cautiously. He didn't mean to go in. Timothy was just as wary of George's
father as the others were!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
ran upstairs to the girls' bedroom again. Where was his basket? Ah, there it
was by the window-seat. Good! That meant he was to sleep in the girls' bedroom
once more. He curled himself up in his basket, and thumped loudly with his
tail.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Glad
to be back,' said his tail, 'glad - to - be - back!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chapter
Two<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>ALL
TOGETHER AGAIN<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>THE
next day the boys came back. Anne and George went to meet them with Timothy.
George drove the pony-trap, and Tim sat beside her. Anne could hardly wait for
the train to stop at the station. She ran along the platform, looking for
Julian and Dick in the carriages that passed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then
she saw them. They were looking out of a window at the back of the train,
waving and yelling.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Anne!
Anne! Here we are! Hallo, George! Oh, there's Timothy!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Julian!
Dick!' yelled Anne. Timothy began to bark and leap about. It was most exciting.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh,
Julian! It's lovely to see you both again!' cried Anne, giving her two brothers
a hug each. Timothy leapt up and licked them both. He was beside himself with
joy. Now he had all the children around him that he loved.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
three children and the dog stood happily together, all talking at once whilst
the porter got the luggage out of the train. Anne suddenly remembered George.
She looked round her. She was nowhere to be seen, although she had come on the
station platform with Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Where's
old George?' said Julian. 'I saw her here when I waved out of the window.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'She
must have gone back to the pony-trap,' said Anne. 'Tell the porter to bring
your trunks out to the trap, Julian. Come along! We'll go and find George.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
was standing by the pony, holding his head. She looked rather gloomy, Anne
thought. The boys went up to her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Hallo,
George, old thing!' cried Julian, and gave her a hug. Dick did the same.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'What's
up?' asked Anne, wondering at George's sudden silence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
believe George felt left-cut!' said Julian with a grin. 'Funny old Georgina!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Don't
call me Georgina!' said the little girl fiercely. The boys laughed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Ah,
it's the same fierce old George, all right,' said Dick, and he gave the girl a
friendly slap on the shoulder. 'Oh, George - it's good to see you again. Do you
remember our marvellous adventures in the summer?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
felt her awkwardness slipping away from her. She had felt left-out when she had
seen the great welcome that the two boys gave to their small sister —' but no
one could sulk for long with Julian and Dick. They just wouldn't let anyone
feel left-out or awkward or sulky.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
four children climbed into the trap. The porter heaved in the two trunks. There
was only just room for them. Timothy sat on top of the trunks, his tail wagging
nineteen to the dozen, and his tongue hanging out because he was panting with
delight.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'You
two girls were lucky to be able to take Tim to school with you,' said Dick,
patting the big dog lovingly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'No
pets are allowed at our school. Awfully hard on those fellows who like live
things.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Thompson
Minor kept white mice,' said Julian. 'And one day they escaped and met Matron
round a corner of the passage. She squealed the place down.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
girls laughed. The boys always had funny tales to tell when they got home.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'And
Kennedy keeps snails,' said Dick. 'You know, snails sleep for the winter - but
Kennedy kept his in far too warm a place, and they all crawled out of their box
and went up the walls. You should have heard how we laughed when the geography
master asked Thompson to point out Cape Town on the map - and there was one of
the snails in the very place!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
laughed again. It was so good to be all together once more. They were very much
of an age -Julian was twelve, George and Dick were eleven, and Anne was ten.
Holidays and Christmas time were in front of them. No wonder they laughed at
everything, even the silliest little joke!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'It's
good that Mummy is getting on all right, isn't it?' said Dick, as the pony went
along the road at a spanking trot. T was disappointed not to go home, I must
say -1 did want to go to see Aladdin and the Lamp, and the Circus - but still,
it's good to be back at Kirrin Cottage again. I wish we could have some more
exciting adventures. Not a hope of that this time, though.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'There's
one snag about these holls,' said Julian. 'And that's the tutor. I hear we've
got to have one because Dick and I missed so much school this term, and we've
got to take scholarship exams next summer.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Yes,'
said Anne. 'I wonder what he'll be like. I do hope he will be a sport. Uncle
Quentin is going to choose one today.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
and Dick made faces at one another. They felt sure that any tutor chosen by
Uncle Quentin would be anything but a sport. Uncle Quentin's idea of a tutor
would be somebody strict and gloomy and forbidding.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Never
mind! He wouldn't come for a day or two. And he might be fun. The boys cheered
up and pulled Timothy's thick coat. The dog pretended to growl and bite. He
wasn't worried about tutors. Lucky Timothy!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all arrived at Kirrin Cottage. The boys were really pleased to see their aunt,
and rather relieved when she said that their uncle had not yet come back.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'He's
gone to see two or three men who have answered the advertisement for a tutor,'
she said. 'He won't be long before he's back.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Mother,
I haven't got to do lessons in the holls too, have I?' asked George. Nothing
had yet been said to her about this, and she longed to know.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh
yes, George,' said her mother. 'Your father has seen your report, and although
it isn't really a bad one, and we certainly didn't expect a marvellous one,
still it does show that you are behind your age in some things. A little extra
coaching will soon help you along.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
looked gloomy. She had expected this but it was tiresome all the same. 'Anne's
the only one who won't have to do lessons,' she said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Til
do some too,' promised Anne. 'Perhaps not always, George, if it's a very fine
day, for instance - but sometimes, just to keep you company.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Thanks,'
said George. 'But you needn't. I shall have Timmy.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George's
mother looked doubtful about this. 'We'll have to see what the tutor says about
that,3 she said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Mother!
If the tutor says I can't have Timothy in the room, I jolly well won't do
holiday lessons!3 began George, fiercely.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Her
mother laughed. 'Well, well - here's our fierce, hot-tempered George again!3
she said. 'Go along, you two boys, and wash your hands and do your hair. You
seem to have collected all the smuts on the railway.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children and Timothy went upstairs. It was such fun to be five again. They
always counted Tim as one of themselves. He went everywhere with them, and
really seemed to understand every single word they said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
wonder what sort of a tutor Uncle Quentin will choose,' said Dick, as he
scrubbed his nails. 'If only he would choose the right kind - someone jolly and
full of fun, who knows that holiday lessons are sickening to have, and tries to
make up for them by being a sport out of lesson-time. I suppose we'll have to
work every morning.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Hurry
up. I want my tea,' said Julian. 'Come on down, Dick. We'll know about the
tutor soon enough P<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all went down together, and sat round the table. Joanna the cook had made a
lovely lot of buns and a great big cake. There was not much left of either by
the &quot; time the four children had finished!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Uncle
Quentin returned just as they were finishing. He seemed rather pleased with
himself. He shook hands<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>with
the two boys and asked them if they had had a good term.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Did
you get a tutor, Uncle Quentin?' asked Anne, who could see that everyone was
simply bursting to know this.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Ah
- yes, I did,' said her uncle. He sat down, whilst Aunt Fanny poured him out a
cup of tea. 'I interviewed three applicants, and had almost chosen the last
one, when another fellow came in, all in a hurry. Said he had only just seen
the advertisement, and hoped he wasn't too late.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Did
you choose him ?' asked Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
did,' said his uncle. 'He seemed a most intelligent fellow. Even knew about me
and my work! And he had the most wonderful letters of recommendation.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
don't think the children need to know all these details,' murmured Aunt Fanny.
'Anyway - you asked him to come?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh
yes,' said Uncle Quentin. 'He's a good bit older than the others - they were
rather young fellows - this one seems very responsible and intelligent. I'm
sure you'll like him, Fanny. He'll fit in here very well. I feel I would like
to have him to talk to me sometimes in the evening.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children couldn't help feeling that the new tutor sounded rather alarming.
Their uncle smiled at the gloomy faces.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'You'll
like Mr. Roland,' he said. 'He knows how to handle youngsters - knows he's got
to be very firm, and to see that you know a good bit more at the end of the
holidays than you did at the beginning.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
sounded even more alarming. All four children<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>wished
heartily that Aunt Fanny had been to choose the tutor, and not Uncle Quentin.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'When
is he coming ?' asked George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Tomorrow,'
said her father. 'You can all go to meet him at the station. That will be a
nice welcome for him.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'We
had thought of taking the bus and going to do a bit of Christmas shopping,'
said Julian, seeing Anne looked very disappointed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh,
no, you must certainly go and meet Mr. Roland,' said his uncle. 'I told him you
would. And mind you, you four - no nonsense with him! You've to do as you're
told, and you must work hard with him, because your father is paying very high
fees for his coaching. I'm paying a third, because I want him to coach George a
little too - so George, you must do your best.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I'll
try,' said George. 'If he's nice, I'll do my very best.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'You'll
do your best whether you think him nice or not!' said her father, frowning. 'He
will arrive by the ten-thirty train. Be sure to be there in time.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
do hope he won't be too strict,5 said Dick, that evening, when the five of them
were alone for a minute or two. 'It's going to spoil the holls, if we have
someone down on us all the time. And I do hope he'll like Timothy.3<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
looked up at once. 'Like Timothy!' she said. 'Of couise he'll like Timothy! How
couldn't he ?3<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well
- your father didn't like Timothy very much last summer,3 said Dick. T don't
see how anyone could dislike darling Tim - but there are people who don't like
dogs, you know, George.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'If
Mr. Roland doesn't like Timothy, I'll not do a single thing for him,' said
George. 'Not one single thing!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'She's
gone all fierce again!' said Dick, with a laugh. 'My word - the sparks will fly

morning the sun was out, all the sea-mist that had hung about for the last two
days had disappeared, and Kirrin Island showed plainly at the mouth of Kirrin
Bay. The children stared longingly at the ruined castle on it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
do wish we could get over to the castle,' said Dick. 'It looks quite calm
enough, George.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'It's

all of it,' said George. 'Now we don't own anything except Kirrin Island, our
ov/n house - and that farm away over there - Kirrin Farm.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
pointed with her whip. The children saw a fine old farm-house standing on a
hill a good way off, over the heather-clad common.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Who
lives there ?' asked Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh,
an old farmer and his wife,' said George. 'They were nice to me when I was
smaller. We'll go over there one day if you like. Mother says they don't make
the farm pay any more, and in the summer-time they take in people who want a
holiday.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Hark!
That's the train whistling in the tunnel!' said Julian, suddenly. 'Buck up, for
goodness' sake, George. We shan't be there in time!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
four children and Timothy looked at the train coming out of the tunnel and
drawing in at the station. The pony cantered along swiftly. They would be just
in time.<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>           </span>'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Who's
going on to the platform to meet him?' asked George, as they drew into the
little station yard. Tm not. I must look after Tim and the pony.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
don't want to,' said Anne. Til stay with George.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,
we'd better go, then,' said Julian, and he and Dick leapt out of the trap. They
ran on to the platform just as the train pulled up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Not
many people got out. A woman clambered out with a basket. A young man leapt
out, whistling, the son of the baker in the village. An old man climbed down
with difficulty. The tutor could be none of those!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then,
right at the front of the train, rather a queer-looking man got out. He was
short and burly, and he had a beard rather like a sailor. His eyes were
piercingly blue, and his thick hair was sprinkled with grey. He<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>glanced
up and down trie platiorm, and then beckoned to the porter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'That
must be Mr. Roland', said Julian to Dick. 'Come on - let's ask him. There's no
one else it could be.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boys went up to the bearded man. Julian raised his cap politely. 'Are you Mr.
Roland, sir ?' he asked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
am,' said the man. 'I suppose you are Julian and Dick?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Yes,
sir,' answered the boys together. 'We brought the pony-trap for your luggage.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh,
fine,' said Mr. Roland. His bright blue eyes looked the boys up and down, and
he smiled. Julian and Dick liked him. He seemed sensible and jolly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Are
the other two here as well?' said Mr. Roland, walking down the platform, with
the porter trailing behind with his luggage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Yes
- George and Anne are outside with the trap,' said Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'George
and Anne,' said Mr. Roland, in a puzzled voice. 'I thought the others were
girls. I didn't know there was a third boy.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh,
George is a girl,' said Dick, with a laugh. 'Her real name is Georgina.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'And
a very nice name too,' said Mr. Roland.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'George
doesn't think so,' said Julian. 'She won't answer if she's called Georgina.
You'd better call her George, sir!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Really?'
said Mr. Roland, in rather a chilly tone. Julian took a glance at him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Not
quite so jolly as he looks!' thought the boy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Tim's
out there too,' said Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh
- ana is i im a ooy or a gin'. inquired ivir. noiana, cautiously.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'A
dog, sir!' said Dick, with a grin.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr.
Roland seemed rather taken-aback. 'A dog?' he said. 'I didn't know there was a
dog in the household. Your uncle said nothing to me about a dog.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Don't
you like dogs?' asked Julian, in surprise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'No,'
said Mr. Roland, shortly. 'But I daresay your dog won't worry me much. Hallo,
hallo - so here are the little girls! How do you do ?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
was not very pleased at being called a little girl. For one thing she hated to
be spoken of as little, and for another thing she always tried to be a boy. She
held out her hand to Mr. Roland and said nothing. Anne smiled at him, and Mr.
Roland thought she was much the nicer of the two.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Tim!
Shake hands with Mr. Roland!' said Julian to Timothy. This was one of Tim's
really good tricks. He could hold out his right paw in a very polite manner.
Mr. Roland looked down at the big dog, and Tim looked back at him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then,
very slowly and deliberately, Timothy turned his back on Mr. Roland and climbed
up into the pony-trap! Usually he put out his paw at once when told to, and the
children stared at him in amazement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Timothy!
What's come over you?' cried Dick. Tim put his ears down and did not move.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'He
doesn't like you,' said George, looking at Mr. Roland. 'That's very queer. He
usually likes people. But perhaps you don't like dogs ?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'No,
I don't, as a matter of fact,' said Mr. Roland.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
was once very badly bitten as a boy, and somehow or other I've never managed to
like dogs since. But I daresay your Tim will take to me sooner or later.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all got into the trap. It was a tight squeeze. Timothy looked at Mr. Roland's
ankles as if he would rather like to nibble them. Anne laughed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Tim
is behaving queerly!' she said. 'It's a good thing you haven't come to teach
him, Mr. Roland!' She smiled up at the tutor, and he smiled back, showing very
white teeth. His eyes were as brilliant a blue as George's.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
liked him. He joked with the boys as they drove him, and both of them began to
feel that their Uncle Quentin hadn't made such a bad choice after all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Only
George said nothing. She sensed that the tutor disliked Timothy, and George was
not prepared to like anyone who didn't take to Timothy at first sight. She
thought it was very queer too, that Tim would not shake paws with the tutor.
'He's a clever dog,' she thought. 'He knows Mr. Roland doesn't like him, so he
won't shake hands. I don't blame you, Tim darling. I wouldn't shake hands with
anyone who didn't lite me!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr.
Roland was shown up to his room when he arrived. Aunt Fanny came down and spoke
to the children. 'Well! He seems very nice and jolly - though it's funny to see
a youngish man with a beard.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Youngish!'
exclaimed Julian. 'Why, he's awfully old! Must be forty at the very least!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Aunt
Fanny laughed. 'Does he seem so old to you ?' she said. 'Well, old or not,
he'll be quite nice to you, I'm sure.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Aunt
Fanny, we shan't begin lessons until after Christmas, shall we ?' asked Julian,
anxiously.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Of
course you will!' said his aunt. 'It is almost a week till Christmas - you
don't suppose we have asked Mr. Roland to come and do nothing till Christmas is
over, do you ?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children groaned. 'We wanted to do some Christmas shopping,' said Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,
you can do that in the afternoons,' said her aunt. 'You will only do lessons in
the morning, for three hours. That won't hurt any of you!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
new tutor came downstairs at that moment, and Aunt Fanny took him to see Uncle
Quentin. She came out after a while, looking very pleased.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Mr.
Roland will be nice company for your uncle,' she said to Julian. 'I think they
will get on very well together. Mr. Roland seems to understand quite a bit
about your uncle's work.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Let's
hope he spends most of his time with him then!' said George, in a low voice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Come
on out for a walk,' said Dick. 'It's so fine today. We shan't have lessons this
morning, shall we, Aunt Fanny ?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh,
no,' said his aunt. 'You'll begin tomorrow. Go for a walk now, all of you - we
shan't often get sunny days like this!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Let's
go over to Kirrin Farm,' said Julian. 'It looks such a nice place. Show us the
way, George.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Right!'
said George. She whistled to Timothy, and he came bounding up. The five of them
set off together, going down the lane, and then on to a rough road over<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the
common that led to the farm on the distant hill.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was lovely walking in the December sun. Their feet rang on the frosty path, and
Tim's blunt claws made quite a noise as he pattered up and down, overjoyed at
being with his four friends again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>After
a good long walk across the common the children came to the farm-house. It was
built of white stone, and stood strong and lovely on the hillside. George
opened the farm-gate and went into the farm-yard. She kept her hand on Tim's
collar for there were two farm-dogs somewhere about.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Someone
clattered round the barn near by. It was an old man, and George hailed him
loudly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Hallo,
Mr. Sanders! How are you ?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Why,
if it isn't Master George!' said the old fellow with a grin. George grinned
too. She loved being called Master instead of Miss.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'These
are my cousins,' shouted George. She turned to the others. 'He's deaf,' she
said. 'You'll have to shout to make him hear.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Tm
Julian,' said Julian in a loud voice and the others said their names too. The
farmer beamed at them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'You
come along in and see the Missis,' he said. 'She'll be rare pleased to see you
all. We've known Master George since she was a baby, and we knew her mother
when she was a baby too, and we knew her granny as well.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'You
must be very, very old,' said Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
farmer smiled down at her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'As
old as my tongue and a little older than my teeth!' he said, chuckling. 'Come
away in now.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all went into the big, warm farm-house kitchen, where a little old woman, as
lively as a bantam hen, was bustling about. She was just as pleased to see the
four children as her husband was.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,
there now!' she said. 'I haven't seen you for months, Master George. I did hear
that you'd gone away to school.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Yes,
I did,' said George. 'But I'm home for the holidays now. Does it matter if I
let Timothy loose, Mrs. Sanders? I think he'll be friendly if your dogs are,
too.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Yes,
you let him loose,' said the old lady. 'He'll have a fine time in the farm-yard
with Ben and Rikky. Now what would you like to drink? Hot milk? Cocoa? Coffee?
And I've some new shortbread baked yesterday. You shall have some of that.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Ah,
the wife's very busy this week, cooking up all sorts of things,' said the old
farmer, as his wife bustled off to the larder. 'We've company this Christmas!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Have
you ?' said George, surprised, for she knew that the old pair had never had any
children of their own. 'Who is coming ? Anyone I know ?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Two
artists from London Town!' said the old farmer. 'Wrote and asked us to take
them for three weeks over Christmas - and offered us good money too. So the old
wife's as busy as a bee.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Are
they going to paint pictures ?' asked Julian, who rather fancied himself as an
artist, too. 'I wonder if I could come and talk to them some day. I'm rather
good at pictures myself. They might give me a few hints.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'You
come along whenever you like,' said old Mrs. Sanders, making cocoa in a big
jug. She set out a plate of<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>most
delicious-looking shortbreads, and the children ate them hungrily.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
should think the two artists will be rather lonely down here, in the depths of
the country at Christmastime,' said George. 'Do they know anyone ?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'They
say they don't know a soul,' said Mrs. Sanders. 'But there - artists are queer
folk. I've had some here before. They seemed to like mooning about all alone.
These two will be happy enough, I'll be bound.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'They
should be, with all the good things you're cooking up for them,' said her old
husband. 'Well, I must be out after the sheep. Good-day to you, youngsters.
Come again and see us sometimes.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
went out. Old Mrs. Sanders chattered on to the children as she bustled about
the big kitchen. Timothy ran in and settled down on the rug by the fire.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
suddenly saw a tabby cat slinking along by the wall, all her hairs on end with
fear of the strange dog. He gave a delighted wuff and sprang at the cat. She
fled out of the kitchen into the old panelled hall. Tim flew after her, taking
no notice at all of George's stern shout.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
cat tried to leap on top of an old grandfather clock in the hall. With a joyous
bark Tim sprang too. He flung himself against a polished panel - and then a
most extraordinary thing happened!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
panel disappeared - and a dark hole showed in the old wall! George, who had
followed Tim out into the hall, gave a loud cry of surprise. 'Look! Mrs.
Sanders, come and look!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chapter

EXCITING DISCOVERY<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>OLD
Mrs. Sanders and the other three children rushed out into the hall when they
heard George's shout.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'What's
up?' cried Julian. 'What's happened?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Tim
sprang at the cat, missed her, and fell hard against the panelled wall,' said
George, 'And the panel moved, and look - there's a &quot;hole in the wall!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'It's
a secret panel!' cried Dick, in excitement, peering into the hole. 'Golly! Did
you know there was one here, Mrs. Sanders?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh
yes,' said the old lady. 'This house is full of funny things like that. I'm
very careful when \ polish that panel, because if I rub too hard in the top
corner, it always slides back.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'What's
behind the panel?' asked Julian. The hole was only about the width of his head,
and when he stuck his head inside, he could see only darkness. The wall itself
was about eight inches behind the panelling, and was of stone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Get
a candle, do, get a candle!' said Anne, thrilled. 'You haven't got a torch,
have you, Mrs. Sanders ?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'No,'
said the old woman. 'But you can get a candle if you like. There's one on the
kitchen mantelpiece.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
shot off to get it. Julian lighted it and put it into the hole behind the
panel. The others pushed against him to try and peep inside.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Don't,'
said Julian, impatiently. 'Wait your turn, sillies! Let me have a look.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
had a good look, but there didn't really seem anything to see. It was all
darkness behind, and stone wall. He gave the candle to Dick, and then each of
the children had a turn at peeping. Old Mrs. Sanders had gone back to the
kitchen. She was used to the sliding panel!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'She
said this house was full of queer things like that,' said Anne. 'What other
things are there, do you think ? Let's ask her.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
slid the panel back into place and went to find Mrs. Sanders. 'Mrs. Sanders,
what other funny things are there in Kirrin Farm-house ?' asked Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'There's
a cupboard upstairs with a false back,' said Mrs. Sanders. 'Don't look so
excited! There's nothing in it at all! And there's a big stone over there by
the fireplace that pulls up to show a hidey-hole. I suppose in the old days
people wanted good hiding-places for things.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children ran to the stone she pointed out. It had an iron ring in it, and was
easily pulled up. Below was a hollowed-out place, big enough to take a small
box. It was empty now, but all the same it looked exciting.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Where's
the cupboard ?' asked Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'My
old legs are too tired to go traipsing upstairs this morning,' said the
farmer's wife. 'But you can go youi selves. Up the stairs, turn to the right,
and go into the second door you see. The cupboard is at the farther end. Open
the door and feel about at the bottom till you come across a dent in the wood.
Press it hard, and the false back slides to the side.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
four children and Timothy ran upstairs as fast as they could, munching
shortbread as they went. This really was a very exciting morning!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
found the cupboard, and opened the door. All foyr went down on hands arid knees
to press round the bottom of the cupboard to find the dented place. Anne found
it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I've
got it!' she cried. She pressed hard, but her little fingers were not strong
enough to work the mechanism of the sliding back. Julian had to help her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was a creaking noise, and the children saw the false back of the cupboard sliding
sideways. A big space showed behind, large enough to take a fairly thin man.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'A
jolly good hiding-place,' said Julian. 'Anyone could hide there and no one
would ever know!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Til
get in and you shut me up,' said Dick. 'It would be exciting.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
got into the space. Julian slid the back across, and Dick could no longer be
seen!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Bit
of a tight fit!' he called. 'And awfully dark! Let me out again.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children all took turns at going into the space behind the back of the cupboard
and being shut up. Anne didn't like it very much.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went down to the warm kitchen again. 'It's a most exciting cupboard, Mrs.
Sanders,' said Julian. 'I do wish we lived in a house like this, full of
secrets!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Can
we come and play in that cupboard again?' asked George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'No,
I'm afraid you can't, Master George,' said Mrs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sanders.
'That room where the cupboard is, is one the two gentlemen are going to have.3<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh!'
said Julian, disappointed. 'Shall you tell them about the sliding back, Mrs.
Sanders ?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
don't expect so,' said the old lady. 'It's only you children that get excited
about things like that, bless you. Two gentlemen wouldn't think twice about
it.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'How
funny grown-ups are!' said Anne, puzzled. 'I'm quite certain I shall be
thrilled to see a sliding panel or a trap-door even when I'm a hundred.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Same
here,' said Dick. 'Could I just go and look into -the sliding panel in the hall
once more, Mrs. Sanders? I'll take the candle.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
never knew why he suddenly wanted to have another look. It was just an idea he
had. The others didn't bother to go with him, for there really was nothing to
see behind the panelling except the old stone wall.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
took the candle and went into the hall. He pressed on the panel at the top and
it slid back. He put the candle inside and had another good look. There was
nothing at all to be seen. Dick took out his head and put in his arm,
stretching along the wall as far as his hand would reach. He was just about to
take it back when his fingers found a hole in the wall.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Funny!'
said Dick. 'Why should there be a hole in the stone wall just there ?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
stuck in his finger and thumb and worked them about. He felt a little ridge
inside the wall, rather like a bird's perch, and was able to get hold of it. He
wriggled his fingers about the perch, but nothing happened. Then he got a good
hold and pulled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
stone came right out! Dick was so surprised that he let go the heavy stone and
it fell to the ground behind the panelling with a crash!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>*The
noise brought the others out into the hall. 'Whatever are you doing, Dick ?'
said Julian, 'Have you broken something ?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'No,'
said Dick, his face reddening with excitement. 'I say - I put my hand in here -
and found a hole in one of the stones the wall is made of - and I got hold of a
sort of ridge with my finger and thumb and pulled. The stone came right out,
and I got such a surprise I let go. It fell, and that's what you heard!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Golly!'
said Julian, trying to push Dick away from the open panel. 'Let me see.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'No,
Julian,' said Dick, pushing him away. 'This is my discovery. Wait till I see if
I can feel anything in the hole. It's difficult to get at!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
others waited impatiently. Julian could hardly prevent himself from pushing
Dick right away. Dick put his arm in as far as he could, and curved his hand
round to get into the space behind where the stone had been. His fingers felt
about and he closed them round something that felt like a book. Cautiously and
carefully ne brought it out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'An
old book!' he said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'What's
in it ?' cried Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
turned the pages carefully. They were so dry and brittle that some of them fell
into dust.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
think it's a book of recipes,' said Anne, as her sharp eyes read a few words in
the old brown, faded handwriting. 'Let's take it to Mrs. Sanders.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children carried the book to the old lady. She laughed at their beaming faces.
She took the book and looked at it, not at all excited.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Yes,'
she said. 'It's a book of recipes, that's all it is. See the name in thes front
- Alice Mary Sanders - that must have been my great-grandmother. She was famous
for her medicines, I know. It was said she could cure any ill in man or animal,
no matter what it was.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'It's
a pity it's so hard to read her writing,' said Julian, disappointed. 'The whole
book is falling to pieces too. It must be very old.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Do
you think there's anything else in that hidey-hole ?' asked Anne. 'Julian, you
go and put your arm in, it's longer than Dick's.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'There
didn't seem to be anything else at all,' said Dick. 'It's a very small place -
just a few inches of hollow space behind that brick or stone that fell down.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,
I'll just put my hand in and see,' said Julian. They all went back into the
hal]. Julian put his arm into the open panel, and slid it along the wall to
where ,the stone had fallen out. His hand went into the space there, and his
long fingers groped about, feeling for anything else that might be there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was something else, something soft and flat that felt like leather. Eagerly the
boy's fingers closed over it and he drew it out carefully, half afraid that it
might fall to pieces with age.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I've
got something!' he said, his eyes gleaming brightly. 'Look - what is it ?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
others crowded round. 'It's rather like Daddy's<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>tobacco
pouch,' said Anne, feeling it. The same shape. Is there anything inside ?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was a tobacco pouch, very dark brown, made of soft leather and very much worn.
Carefully Julian undid the flap, and unrolled the leather.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
few bits of black tobacco were still in the pouch -but there was something
else, too! Tightly rolled up in the last bit of pouch was a piece of linen.
Julian took it out and unrolled it. He put it flat on the hall-table.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children stared at it. There were marks and signs on the linen, done in black
ink that had hardly faded. But the four of them could not make head or tail of
the marks.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'It's
not a map,' said Julian. 'It seems a sort of code, or something. I do wonder
what it means. I wish we could make it out. It must be some sort of secret.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children stared at the piece of linen, very thrilled. It was so old - and
contained some kind of secret. Whatever could it be ?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
ran to show it to Mrs. Sanders. She was studying the old recipe book, and her
face glowed with pleasure as she raised it to look at the excited children.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'This
book's a wonder!' she said. 'I can hardly read the writing, but here's a recipe
for backache. I shall try it myself. My back aches so much at the end of the
day. Now, you listen ...'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
the children didn't want to listen to recipes for backache. They pushed the
piece of lineii on to Mrs. Sanders' lap.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Look!
What's this about, Mrs. Sanders? Do you<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>know
? We found it in a kind of tobacco pouch in that place behind the panel.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mrs.
Sanders took off her glasses, polished them, and put them on again. She looked
carefully at the piece of linen with its strange marks.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
shook her head. 'No - this doesn't make any sense to me. And what's this now -
it looks like an old tobacco pouch. Ah, my John would like that, I guess. He's
got such an old one that it won't hold his tobacco any more! This is old too -
but there's a lot of wear in it yet.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Mrs.
Sanders, do you want this piece of linen too?' asked Julian, anxiously. He was
longing to take it home and study it. He felt certain there was some kind of
exciting secret hidden there, and he could not bear the thought of leaving it
with Mrs. Sanders.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'You
take it, Master Julian, if you want it,' said Mrs. Sanders, with a laugh. Til
keep the recipes for myself, and John shall have the pouch. You can have the
old rag if you want it, though it beats me why you set such store by it! Ah,
here's John!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
raised her voice and shouted to the deaf old man. 'Hey, John, here's a tobacco
pouch' for you. The children found it somewhere behind that panel that opens in
the hall.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>John
took it and fingered it. 'It's a queer one,' he said. 'But better than mine.
Well, youngsters, I don't want to hurry you, but it's one o'clock now, and
you'd best be going if it's near your dinner-time!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Gracious!'
said Julian. 'We shall be late! Good-bye, Mrs. Sanders, and thanks awfully for
the shortbread and this old rag. We'll try our best to make out what's on it<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>and
tell you. Hurry, everyone! Where's Tim ? Come on, Timothy, we're late!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
five of them ran off quickly. They really were late, and had to run most of the
way, which meant that it was difficult to talk. But they were so excited about
their morning that they panted remarks to one another as they went.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
wonder what this old rag says!' panted Julian. 'I mean to find out. I'm sure
it's something mysterious.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Shall
we tell anyone ?' asked Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'No!'
said George. 'Let's keep it a secret.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'If
Anne starts to give away anything, kick her under the table, like we did last
summer,' said Julian, with a grin. Poor Anne always found jt difficult to keep
a secret, and often had to be nudged or kicked when she began to give things
away.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
won't say a word,' said Anne, indignantly. 'And don't you dare to kick me. It
only makes me cry out and then the grown-ups want to know why.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'We'll
have a good old puzzle over this piece of linen after dinner,' said Julian. 'I
bet we'll find out what it says, if we really make up our minds to!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Here
we are,' said George. 'Not too late. Hallo, Mother! We won't be a minute
washing our hands! We've had a lovely time.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chapter
Five<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>AN
UNPLEASANT WALK<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>AFTER
dinner the four children went upstairs to the boys' bedroom and spread out the
bit of linen on a table there. There were words here and there, scrawled in
rough printing. There was the sign of a compass, with E marked clearly for
East. There were eight rough squares, and in one of them, right in the middle,
was a cross. It was all very mysterious.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'You
know, I believe these words are Latin,' said Julian, trying to make them out.
'But I can't read them properly. And I expect if I could read them, I wouldn't
know what they meant. I wish we knew someone who could read Latin like this.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Could
your father, George?' asked Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
expect so,' said George. But nobody wanted to ask George's father. He might
lake the curious old rag away. He might forget all about it, he might even burn
it. Scientists were such queer people.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'What
about Mr. Roland?' said Dick. 'He's a tutor. He knows Latin.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'We
won't ask him till we know a bit more about him,' said Julian, cautiously. 'He
seems quite jolly and nice -but you never know. Oh, blow - I wish we could make
this out, I really do.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'There
are two words at the top,' said Dick, and he tried to spell them out. 'VIA
OCCULTA.' 'What do you think they could mean, Julian ?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well
- the only thing I can think of that they can mean is - Secret Way, or
something like that,' said Julian, screwing up his forehead into a frown.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Secret
Way!' said Anne, her eyes shining. 'Oh, I hope it's that! Secret Way! How
exciting. What sort of secret way would it be, Julian ?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'How
do I know, Anne, silly?' said Julian. 'I don't even know that the words are
meant to mean &quot;Secret Way&quot;. It's really a guess on my part.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'If
they did mean that — the linen might have directions to find the Secret Way,
whatever it is,' said Dick. 'Oh Julian - isn't it exasperating that we can't
read it? Do, do try. You know more Latin than I do.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'It's
so hard to read the funny old letters,' said Julian, trying again. 'No - it's
no good at all. I can't make them out.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Steps
came up the stairs, and the door opened. Mr. Roland looked in.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Hallo,
hallo!' he said. 'I wondered where you all were. What about a walk over the
cliffs ?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'We'll
come,' said Julian, rolling up the old rag.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'What
have you got there? Anything interesting?' asked Mr. Roland.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'It's
a -' began Anne, and at once all the others began to talk, afraid that Anne was
going to give the secret away.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'It's
a wonderful afternoon for a walk.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Come
on, let's get our things on!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Tim,
Tim, where are you?' George gave a piercing whistle. Tim was under the bed and
came bounding<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>out.
Anne went red as she guessed why all the others had interrupted her so quickly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Idiot,'
said Julian, under his breath. 'Baby.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Fortunately
Mr. Roland said no more about the piece of linen he had seen Julian rolling up.
He was looking at Tim.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
suppose he must come,' he said. George stared at him in indignation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Of
course he must!' she said. 'We never never go anywhere without Timothy.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr.
Roland went downstairs, and the children got ready to go out. George was
scowling. The very idea of leaving Tim behind made her angry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'You
nearly gave our secret away, you silly,' said Dick to Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
didn't think,' said the little girl, looking ashamed of herself. 'Anyway, Mr.
Roland seems very nice. I think we might ask him if he could help us to understand
those funny words.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'You
leave that to me to decide,' said Julian, crossly. 'Now don't you dare to say a
word.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all set out, Timothy too. Mr. Roland need not have worried about the dog, for
Timothy would not go near him. It was very queer, really. He kept away from the
tutor, and took not the slightest notice of him even when Mr. Roland spoke to
him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'He's
not usually like that,' said Dick. 'He's a most friendly dog, really.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,
as I've got to live in the same house with him, I must try and make him friends
with me,' said the tutor. 'Hie, Timothy! Come here! I've got a biscuit in my
pocket.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timothy
pricked up his ears at the word 'biscuit' but did not even look towards Mr.
Roland. He put his tail down and went to George. She patted him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'If
he doesn't like anyone, not even a biscuit or a bone will make him go to them
when he is called,' she said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr.
Roland gave it up. He put the biscuit back into his pocket. 'He's a
queer-looking dog, isn't he ?' he said. 'A terrible mongrel! I must say I prefer
well-bred dogs.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
went purple in the face. 'He's not queer-looking!' she spluttered. 'He's not
nearly so queer-looking as you! He's not a terrible mongrel. He's the best dog
in the world!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
think you are being a little rude,' said Mr. Roland, stiffly. CI don't allow my
pupils to be cheeky, Georgina.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Galling
her Georgina made George still more furious. She lagged behind with Tim,
looking as black as a thundercloud. The others felt uncomfortable. They knew
what tempers George got into, and how difficult she could be. She had been so
much better and happier since the summer, when they had come to stay for the
first time. They did hope she wasn't going to be silly and get into rows. It
would spoil the Christmas holidays.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr.
Roland took no more notice of George. He did not speak to her, but strode on
ahead with the others, doing his best to be jolly. He could really be very
funny, and the boys began to laugh at him. He took Anne's hand, and the little
girl jumped along beside him, enjoying the walk.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
felt sorry for George. It wasn't nice to be left out of things, and he knew how
George hated anything<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>like
that. He wondered if he dared to put in a good word for her. It might make
things easier.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Mr.
Roland, sir,' he began. 'Could you call my cousin by the name she likes -
George - she simply hates Georgina. And she's very fond of Tim. She can't bear
anyone to say horrid things about him.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr.
Roland looked suiprised. 'My dear boy, I am sure you mean well,' he said, in
rather a dry sort of voice, 'but I hardly think I want your advice about any of
my pupils. I shall follow my own wishes in my treatment of Georgina, not yours.
I want to be friends with you all, and I am sure we shall be — but Georgina has
got to be sensible, as you three are.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
felt rather squashed. He went red and looked at Dick. Dick gave him a squeeze
on his arm. The boys knew George could be silly and difficult, especially if
anyone didn't like her beloved dog - but they thought Mr. Roland might try to
be a bit more understanding too. Dick slipped behind and walked with George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'You
needn't walk with me,' said George at once, her blue eyes glinting. 'Walk with
your friend Mr. Roland.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'He
isn't my friend,' said Dick. 'Don't be silly.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I'm
not silly,' said George, in a tight sort of voice. 'I heard you all laughing
and joking with him. You go on and have a good laugh again. I've got Timothy.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'George,
it's Christmas holidays,' said Dick. 'Do let's all be friends. Do. Don't let's
spoil Christmas.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>T
can't like anyone who doesn't like Tim,' said George, obstinately.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,
after all, Mr. Roland did offer him a biscuit,' said Dick, trying to make peace
as hard as he could.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
said nothing. Her small face looked fierce. Dick tried again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'George!
Promise to try and be nice till Christmas is over, anyway. Don't let's spoil
Christmas, for goodness' sake! Come on, George.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'All
right,' said George, at last. Til try.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Come
and walk with us, then,' said Dick. So George caught up the others, and tried
not to look too sulky. Mr. Roland guessed that Dick had been trying to make
George behave, and he included her in his talk. He could not make her laugh,
but she did at least answer politely.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Is
that Kirrin Farm-house?' asked Mr. Roland, as they came in sight of the farm.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Yes.
Do you know it ?' asked Julian, in surprise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'No,
no,' said Mr. Roland, at once. 'I heard of it, and wondered if that was the
place.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'We
went there this morning,' said Anne. 'It's an exciting place.' She looked at
the others, wondering if they would mind if she said anything about the things
they had seen that morning. Julian thought for a moment. After all, it couldn't
matter telling him about the stone in the kitchen and the false back to the
cupboard. Mrs. Sanders would tell anyone that. He could speak about the sliding
panel in the hall too, and say they had found an old recipe book there. He did
not need to say anything about the old bit of marked linen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
he told their tutor about the exciting things they had seen at the old
farm-house, but said nothing at all about the linen and its strange markings.
Mr. Roland listened with the greatest interest.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'This
is all very remarkable,' he said. 'Very remark-<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>able
indeed. Most interesting. You say the old couple live there quite alone ?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,
they are having two people to stay over Christmas,' said Dick, 'Artists. Julian
thought he would go over and talk to them. He can paint awfully well, you
know.' •'<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>   </span>•<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Can
he really?' said Mr. Roland. 'Well, he must show me some of, his pictures. But
I don't think he'd better go and worry the artists at the farm-house. They
mieht not like it.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
remark made Julian feel obstinate. He made up his mind at once that he would go
and talk to the two artists when he got the chance! ,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was quite a pleasant walk on the whole except that George was quiet, and
Timothy would not go anywhere near Mr. Roland. When they came to a frozen pond
Dick threw sticks on it for Tim to fetch. It was so funny to see him go
slithering about on his long legs, trying to run properly!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
threw sticks for the dog, and Tim fetched all the ^sticks except Mr. Roland's.
When the tutor threw a stick the dog looked at it and took no more notice It
was almost as if he had said. 'What, your stick! No thank you!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Now,
home we go,' said Mr. Roland, trying not to look annoyed with Tim. 'We shall
just be in time for tea!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chapter
Six<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>LESSONS
WITH MR. ROLAND<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>NEXT
morning the children felt a little gloomy. Lessons! How horrid in the holidays!
Still, Mr. Roland wasn't so bad. The children had not had him with them in the
sitting-room the night before, because he had gone to talk to their uncle. So
they were able to get out the mysterious bit of linen again and pore over it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
it wasn't a bit of good. Nobody could make anything of it at all. Secret Way!
What did it mean? Was it really directions for a Secret Way? And where was the
way, and why was it secret? It was most exasperating not to be able to find
out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
really feel we'll have to ask someone soon,' Julian had said with a sigh. 'I
can't bear this mystery much longer. I keep on and on thinking of it.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
had dreamt of it too that night, and now it was morning, with lessons ahead. He
wondered what lesson Mr. Roland would take - Latin perhaps. Then he could ask
him what the words 'VIA OCCULTA' meant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr.
Roland had seen all their reports and had noted the subjects they were weak in.
One was Latin, and another was French. Maths were very weak in both Dick's
report and George's. Both children must be helped on in those. Geometry was
Julian's weakest spot.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
was not supposed to need any coaching. 'But if you like to come along and join
us, I'll give you some<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>painting
to do,' said Mr. Roland, his blue eyes twinkling at her. He liked Anne. She was
not difficult and sulky like George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
loved painting. 'Oh, yes,' she said, happily, Td love to do some painting. I
can paint flowers, Mr. Roland. I'll paint you some red poppies and blue
cornflowers out of my head.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'We
will start at half-past nine,' said Mr. Roland. 'We are to work in the
sitting-room. Take your school-books there, and be ready punctually.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
all the children were there, sitting round a table, their books in front of
them, at half-past nine. Anne had some painting water and her painting-box. The
others looked at her enviously. Lucky Anne, to be doing painting whilst they
worked hard at difficult things like Latin and maths!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Where's
Timothy?' asked Julian in a low voice, as they waited for their tutor to come
in.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Under
the table/ said George, defiantly. Tm sure he'll lie still. Don't any of you
say anything about him. I want him there. I'm not going to do lessons without
Tim here.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
don't see why he shouldn't be here with us,' said Dick. 'He's very very good.
Sh! Here comes Mr. Roland.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
tutor came in, his black beard bristling round his mouth and chin. His eyes
looked very piercing in the pale winter sunlight that filtered into the room.
He told the children to sit down.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I'll
have a look at your exercise books first,' he said, 'and see what you were
doing last term. You come first, Julian.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Soon
the little class were working quietly together. Anne was very busy painting a
bright picture of poppies and cornflowers. Mr. Roland admired it very much.
Anne thought he really was very nice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Suddenly
there was a huge sigh from under the table. It was Tim, tired of lying so still
Mr. Roland looked up, surprised. George at once sighed heavily, hoping that Mr.
Roland would think it was she who had sighed before.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'You
sound tired, Georgina,' said Mr. Roland. 'You shall all have a little break at
eleven.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
frowned. She hated being called Georgina. She put her foot cautiously on
Timothy to warn him not to make any more noises. Tim licked her foot.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>After
a while, just when the class was at its very quietest, Tim felt a great wish to
scratch himself very hard on his back. He got up. He sat down again with a
thump, gave a grunt, and began to scratch himself furiously. The children all
began to make noises to hide the sounds that Tim was making.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
clattered her feet on the floor. Julian began to cough, and let one of his book
slip to the ground. Dick jiggled the table and spoke to Mr. Roland.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh
dear, this sum is so hard; it really is! I keep doing it and doing it, and it
simply won't come right!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Why
all this sudden noise ?' said Mr. Roland in surprise. 'Stop tapping the floor
with your feet, Georgina.3<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Tim
settled down quietly again. The children gave a sigh of relief. They became
quiet, and Mr. Roland told Dick to corne to him with his maths book.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
tutor took it, and stretched his legs out under the table, leaning back to
speak to Dick. To his enorm-<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>ous
surprise his feet struck something soft and warm -and then something nipped him
sharply on the ankle! He drew in his feet with a cry of pain.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children stared at him. He bent down and looked under the table. 'It's that
dog,' he said, in disgust. 'The brute snapped at my ankles. He has made a hole
in my trousers. Take him out, Georgina.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Georgina
said nothing. She sat as though she had not heard.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'She
won't answer if you call her Georgina,' Julian reminded him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'She'll
answer me whatever I call her,' said Mr. Roland, in a low and angry voice. 'I
won't have that dog in here. If you don't take him out this very minute,
Georgina, I will go to your father.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
looked at him. She knew perfectly well that if she didn't take Tim out, and Mr.
Roland went to her father, he would order Timothy to live in the garden kennel,
and that would be dreadful. There was absolutely nothing to be done but obey.
Red in the face, a huge frown almost hiding her eyes, she got up and spoke to
Tim.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Come
on, Tim! I'm not surprised you bit him. I would, too, if I were a dog!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'There
is no need to be rude, Georgina,' said Mr. Roland, angrily.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
others stared at George. They wondered how she dared to say things like that.
When she got fierce it seemed as if she didn't care for anyone at all!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Come
back as soon as you have put the dog out,' said Mr. Roland.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
scowled, but came back in a few minutes. She ielt caught. Her father was
friendly with Mr. Roland, and knew how difficult George was — if she behaved as
badly as she felt she would like to, it would be Tim who would suffer, for he
would certainly be banished from the house. So for Tim's sake George obeyed the
tutor — but from that moment she disliked him and resented him bitterly with
all her fierce little heart.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
otheis were soiry for George and Timothy, but they did not share the little
girl's intense dislike of the new tutor. He often made them laugh. He was
patient with their mistakes. He was willing to show them how to make paper
darts and ships, and to do funny little tricks. Julian and Dick thought these
were fun, and stored them up to try on the other boys when they went back to
school.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>After
lessons that morning the children went out for half an hour in the frosty
sunshine. George called Tim.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Poor
old boy!' she said. 'What a shame to turn you out of-the room! Whatever did you
snap at Mr. Roland for? I think it was a very good idea, Tim - but I really
don't know what made you!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'George,
you can't play about with Mr. Roland,' said Julian. 'You'll only get into
trouble. He's tough. He won't stand much from any of us. But I think he'll be
quite a good sport if we get on the right side of him.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,
get on the right side of him if you like,' said George, in rather a sneering
voice. Tm not going to. If I don't like a person, I don't - and I don't like
him.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Why
? Just because he doesn't like Tim ?' asked Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Mostly
because of that - but because he makes me<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>feel
prickly down my back,' said George, 'I don't like his nasty mouth.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'But
you can't see it,' said Julian. 'It's covered with his moustache and beard.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I've
seen his lips through them,' said George, obstinately. 'They're thin and cruel.
You look and see. I don't like thin-lipped people. They are always spiteful and
hard. And I don't like his cold eyes either. You can suck up to him all you
like. / shan't.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
refused to get angry with the stubborn little girl. He laughed at her. 'We're
not going to suck up to him,' he said. 'We're just going to be sensible, that's
all. You be sensible too, George, old thing.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
once George had made up her mind about something nothing would alter her. She
cheered up when she heard that they were all to go Christmas shopping on the
bus that afternoon - without Mr. Roland! He was going to watch an experiment
that her father was going to show him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
will take you into the nearest town and you shall shop to your heart's
content,' said Aunt Fanny to the children. 'Then we will have tea in a tea-shop
and catch the six o'clock bus home.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
was fun. They caught the afternoon bus and rumbled along the deep country lanes
till they got to the town. The shops looked very gay and bright. The children
had brought their money with them, and were very busy indeed, buying all kinds
of things. There were so many people to get presents for!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
suppose we'd better get something for Mr. Roland, hadn't we ?' said Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I'm
going to,' said Anne. Tm going to buy him a packet of cigarettes. I know the
kind he smokes.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Fancy
buying Mr. Roland a present!' said George, in her scornful voice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Why
shouldn't she, George?' asked her mother, in surprise. 'Oh dear, I hope you are
going to be sensible about him, and not take a violent dislike to the poor man.
I don't want him to complain to your father about you.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'What
are you going to buy for Tim, George ?' asked Julian, changing the subject
quickly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'The
largest bone the butcher has got,' said George. 'What are you going to buy him
?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
guess if Tim had money, he would buy us each a present,' said Anne, taking hold
of the thick hair round Tim's neck, and pulling it lovingly. 'He's the best dog
in the world!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
forgave Anne for saying she would buy Mr. Roland a present, when the little
girl said that about Tim! She cheered up again and began to plan what she would
buy for everyone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
had a fine tea, and caught the six o'clock bus back. Aunt Fanny went to see if
the cook had given the two men their tea. She came out of the study beaming.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Really,
I've never seen your uncle so jolly,' she said to Julian and Dick. 'He and Mr.
Roland are getting on like a house on fire. He has been showing your tutor
quite a lot of his experiments. It's nice for him to have someone to talk to
that knows a little about these things.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr.
Roland played games with the children that evening. Tim was in the room, and
the tutor tried again<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>to
make friends with him, but the dog refused to take any notice of him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'As
sulky as his little mistress!' said the tutor, with a laughing look at George,
who was watching Tim refuse to go to Mr. Roland, and looking rather pleased
about it. She gave the tutor a scowl and said nothing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Shall
we ask him whether &quot;VIA OCCULT&quot; really does mean &quot;Secret
Way&quot; or not, tomorrow?' said Julian to Dick, as they undressed that night.
'I'm just longing to know if it does. What do you think of Mr. Roland, Dick ?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
don't really quite know,' said Dick. 'I like lots of things about him, but then
I suddenly don't like him at all. I don't like his eyes. And George is quite
right about his lips. They are so thin there's hardly anything of them at all.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
think he's all right,' said Julian. 'He won't stand any nonsense, that's all. I
wouldn't mind showing him the whole piece of rag and asking him to make out its
meaning for us.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
thought you said it was to be a proper secret,' said Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
know - but what's the use of a secret we don't know the meaning of ourselves ?'
said Julian. Til tell you what we could do - ask him to explain the words to
us, and not show him the bit of linen.5<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'But
we can't read some of the words ourselves,' said Dick. 'So that's no use. You'd
have to show him the whole thing, and tell him where we got it.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,
I'll see,' said Julian, getting into bed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
next day there were lessons again from half-past nine to half-past twelve. George
appeared without Tim.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
was angry at having to do this, but it was no good being defiant and refusing
to come to lessons without Tim. Now that he had snapped at Mr. Roland, he had
definitely put himself in the wrong, and the tutor had every right to refuse to
allow him to come. But George looked very sulky indeed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the Latin lesson Julian took the chance of asking what he wanted to know.
'Please, Mr. Roland,' he said, 'could you tell me what &quot;VIA OCGULTA&quot;
means?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'
&quot;ViA OCCULTA&quot; ?' said Mr. Roland, frowning. 'Yes -it means
&quot;Secret Path&quot;, or &quot;Secret Road&quot;. A hidden way - something
like that. Why do you want to know ?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>All
the children were listening eagerly. Their hearts thumped with excitement. So
Julian had been right. That funny bit of rag contained directions for some
hidden way, some secret path — but where to! Where did it begin, and end ?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh
- I just wanted to know,' said Julian. 'Thank you, sir.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
winked at the others. He was as excited as they were. If only, only they could
make out the rest of the markings, they might be able to solve the mystery.
Well — perhaps he would ask Mr. Roland in a day or two. The secret must be
solved somehow.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'
&quot;The Secret Way&quot; ' said Julian to himself, as he worked out a problem
in geometry. ' &quot;The Secret Way&quot;. I'll find it somehow.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chapter
Seven<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>DIRECTIONS
FOR THE SECRET WAY<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>FOR
the next day or two the four children did not really have much time to think
about the Secret Way, because Christmas was coming near, and there was a good
deal to do.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
were Christmas cards to draw and paint for their mothers and fathers and
friends. There was the house to decorate. They went out with Mr. Roland to find
sprays of holly, and came home laden.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'You
look like a Christmas card yourselves,' said Aunt Fanny, as they walked up the
garden path, carrying the red-berried holly over their shoulders. Mr. Roland
had found a group of trees with tufts of mistletoe growing from the top
branches, and they had brought some of that too. Its berries shone like pale
green pearls.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Mr.
Roland had to climb the tree to get this,' said Anne. 'He's a good climber - as
good as a monkey.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
laughed except George. She never laughed at anything to do with the tutor. They
all dumped their loads down in the porch, and went to wash. They were to
decorate the house that evening.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Is
Uncle going to let his study be decorated too?' asked Anne. There were all
kinds of strange instruments and glass tubes in the study now, and the children
looked at them with wonder whenever they ventured into the study, which was
very seldom.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'No,
my study is certainly not to be messed about,' said Uncle Quentin, at once. 'I
wouldn't hear of it.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Uncle,
why do you have all these funny things in your study ?' asked Anne, looking
round with wide eyes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Uncle
Quentin laughed. Tm looking for a secret formula!' he said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'What's
that?' said Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'You
wouldn't understand,' said her uncle. 'All these &quot;funny things&quot; as
you call them, help me in my experiments, and I put down in my book what they
tell me -and from all I learn I work out a secret formula, that will be of
great use when it is finished.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'You
want to know a secret formula, and we want to know a secret way,' said Anne,
quite forgetting that she was not supposed to talk about this.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
was standing by the door. He frowned at Anne. Luckily Uncle Quentin was not
paying any more attention to the little girl's chatter. Julian pulled her out
of the room.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Anne,
the only way to stop you giving away secrets is to sew up your mouth, like Brer
Rabbit wanted to do to Mister Dog!' he said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Joanna
the cook was busy baking Christmas cakes. An enormous turkey had been sent over
from Kirrin Farm, and was hanging up in the larder. Timothy thought it smelt
glorious, and Joanna was always shooing him out of the kitchen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
were boxes of crackers on the shelf in the sitting-room, and mysterious parcels
everywhere. It was very, very Christmassy! The children were happy and excited.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr.
Roland went out and dug up a little spruce fir tree. 'We must have a Christmas
tree,5 he said. 'Have you any tree-ornaments, children ?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'No,'
said Julian, seeing George shake her head.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Til
go into the town this afternoon and get some for you,' promised the tutor. 'It
will be fun dressing the tree. We'll put it in the hall, and light candles on
it on Christmas Day after tea. Who's coming with me to get the candles and the
ornaments ?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
am!' cried three children. But the fourth said nothing. That was George. Not
even to buy tree-ornaments would the obstinate little girl go with Mr. Roland.
She had never had a Christmas tree before, and she was very much looking
forward to it - but it was spoilt for her because Mr. Roland bought the things
that made it so beautiful.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Now
it stood in the hall, with coloured candles in holders clipped to the branches,
and gay shining ornaments hanging from top to bottom. Silver strands of frosted
string hung down from the branches like icicles, and Anne had put bits of white
cotton-wool here and there to look like snow. It really was a lovely sight to
see.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Beautiful!'
said Uncle Quentin, as he passed through the hall, and saw Mr. Roland hanging
the last ornaments on the tree. 'I say - look at the fary doll on the top!
Who's that for ? A good girl ?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
secretly hoped that Mr. Roland would give her the doll. She was sure it wasn't
for George - and anyway, George wouldn't accept it. It was such a pretty doll,
with its gauzy frock and silvery wings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian,
Dick and Anne had quite accepted the tutor<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>now
as teacher and friend. In fact, everyone had, their uncle and aunt too, and even
Joanna the cook. George, of course, was the only exception, and she and Timothy
kept away from Mr. Roland, each looking as sulky as the other whenever the
tutor was in the room.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'You
know, I never knew a dog could look so sulky!' said Julian, watching Timothy.
'Really, he scowls almost like George.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'And
I always feel as if George puts her tail down like Tim, when Mr. Roland is in
the room,' giggled Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Laugh
all you like,' said George, in a low tone. 'I think you're beastly to me. I
know I'm right about Mr. Roland. I've got a feeling about him. And so has Tim.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'You're
silly, George,' said Dick. 'You haven't really got a Feeling - it's only that
Mr. Roland will keep calling you Georgina and putting you in your place, and
that ' he doesn't like Tim. I dare say he can't help disliking i dogs. After
all, there was once a famous man called Lord JiHoberts who couldn't bear cats.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh
well, cats are different,' said George. 'If a person doesn't like dogs,
especially a dog like our Timothy, then there really must be something wrong
with him.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'It's
no use arguing with George,' said Julian, 'Once she's made up her mind about

others thought she was behaving rather stupidly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I'm
surprised really,' said Anne. 'She was so jolly last Ifferm at school. Now
she's gone all queer, rather like she was when we first knew her last summer.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
do think Mr. Roland has been decent digging up the Christmas tree and
everything,' said Dick. 'I still don't like him awfully much sometimes, but I
think he's a sport. What about asking him if he can read that old linen rag for
us -1 don't think I'd mind him sharing our secret, really.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
would love him to share it,' said Anne, who was busy doing a marvellous
Christmas card for the tutor. 'He's most awfully clever. I'm sure he could tell
us what the Secret Way is. Do let's ask him.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'All
right,' said Julian. 'I'll show .him the piece of linen. It's Christmas Eve
tonight. He will be with us in the sitting-room, because Aunt Fanny is going
into the study with Uncle Quentin to wrap up presents for all of us!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So,
that evening, before Mr. Roland came in to sit with them, Julian took out the
little roll of linen and stroked it out flat on the table. George looked at it
in surprise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Mr.
Roland will be here in a minute,' she said. 'You'd better put it away quickly.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'We're
going to ask him if he can tell us what the old Latin words mean,' said Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'You're
not!' cried George, in dismay. 'Ask him to share our secret! However can you ?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,
we want to know what the secret is, don't we?' said Julian. 'We don't need to
tell him where we got this or anything about it except that we want to inow
what the markings mean. We're not exactly sharing the secret with him - only
asking him to use his brains to help us.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,
I never thought you'd ask him,' said George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>he'll
want to know simply everything about it, you st see if he won't ! 'He's
terribly snoopy.' 'Whatever 4° you mean?' said Julian, in surprise. 'I I't
think he's a bit snoopy.' 'I saw him yesterday snooping round the study when
one was there,' said George. 'He didn't see me out-fede the window with Tim. He
was having a real poke<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'You
know how interested he is in your father's work,' paid Julian. 'Why shouldn't
he look at it? Your father •ces him too. You're just seeing what horrid things
you t find to say about Mr. Roland.' 'Oh shut up, you two,9 said Dick. 'It's
Christmas Eve. on't let's argue or quarrel or say beastly things.' Just at that
moment the tutor came into the room, 'All busy as bees ?' he said, his mouth
smiling beneath its ftoustache. 'Too busy to have a game of cards, I sup-aose?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Mr.
Roland, sir,' began Julian, 'could you help us something? We've got an old bit
of linen here with id markings on it. The words seem to be in some sort jfof
Latin and we can't make them out.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
gave an angry exclamation as she saw Julian E push the piece of linen over
towards the tutor. She went of the room and shut the door with a bang. Tim was
S with her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Our
sweet-tempered Georgina doesn't seem to be very ^ friendly tonight/ remarked
Mr. Roland, pulling the bit | of linen towards him. 'Where in the world did you
get ; this ? What an odd thing !'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Nobody
answered. Mr. Roland studied the roll of<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>linen,
and then gave an exclamation. 'Ah - I see why you wanted to know the meaning of
those Latin words the other day - the ones that meant &quot;hidden path&quot;,
you remember. They are at the top of this linen roll.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Yes,'
said Dick. All the children leaned over towards Mr. Roland, hoping he would be
able to unravel a little of the mystery for them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'We
just want to know the meaning of the words, sir,' said Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'This
is really very interesting,' said the tutor, puzzling over the linen.
'Apparently there are directions here for finding the opening or entrance of a
secret path or road.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'That's
what we thought!' cried Julian, excitedly. 'That's exactly what we thought. Oh
sir, do read the directions and see what you make of them.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,
these eight squares are meant to represent wooden boards or panels, I think,'
said the tutor, pointing to the eight rough squares drawn on the linen. 'Wait a
minute - I can hardly read some of the words. This is most fascinating, Solum
lapideum - paries ligneus - and what's this - cellula - yes, cellulal'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children hung on his words. 'Wooden panels!' That must mean panels somewhere at
Kirrin Farm-house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr.
Roland frowned down at the old printed words. Then he sent Anne to borrow a
magnifying glass from her uncle. She came back with it, and the four of them
looked through the glass, seeing the words three times as clearly now.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,'
said the tutor at last, 'as far as I can make out the direction mean this: a
room facing east; eight wooden panels, with an opening somewhere to be found<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>in
that marked one; a stone floor - yes, I think that's right, a stone floor; and
a cupboard. It all sounds most extraordinary and very thrilling. Where did you
get this from?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'We
just found it,' said Julian, after a pause. 'Oh Mr. Roland, thanks awfully. We
could never have made it out by ourselves. I suppose the entrance to the Secret
Way is in a room facing east then.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'It
looks like it,' said Mr. Roland, poring over the linen roll again. 'Where did
you say you found this ?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'We
didn't say,' said Dick. 'It's a secret really, you see.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
think you might tell me,' said the tutor, looking at Dick with his brilliant
blue eyes. 'I can be trusted with secrets. You've no idea how many queer
secrets I know.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,'
said Julian, 'I don't really see why you shouldn't know where we found this,
Mr. Roland. We found it at Kirrin Farm-house, in an old tobacco pouch. I
suppose the Secret Way begins somewhere there! I wonder where and wherever can
it lead to ?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'You
found it at Kirrin Farm-house!' exclaimed Mr. Roland. 'Well, well - I must say
that seems to be an interesting old place. I shall have to go over there one
day.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
rolled up the piece of linen and put it into his pocket. 'Well, thank you,
sir,' he said. 'You've solved a bit of the mystery for us but set us another
puzzle! We must look for the entrance of the Secret Way after Christmas, when
we can walk over to Kirrin Farmhouse.3<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Til
come with you,' said Mr. Roland. 'I may be able<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>to
help a little. That is - if you don't mind me having a little share in this exciting
secret.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well
— you've been such a help in telling us what the words mean,' said Julian;
'we'd like you to come if you want to, sir.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Yes,
we would,' said Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'We'll
go and look for the Secret Way, then,' said Mr. Roland. 'What fun we shall
have, tapping round the panels, waiting for a mysterious dark entrance to
appear!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
don't suppose George will go,' Dick murmured to Julian. 'You shouldn't have
said Mr. Roland could go with us, Ju. That means that old George will have to
be left out of it. You know how she hates that.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
know,' said Julian, feeling uncomfortable. 'Don't let's worry about that now
though. George may feel different after Christmas. She can't keep up this kind
of behaviour for ever!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chapter
Eight<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>WHAT
HAPPENED ON CHRISTMAS NIGHT<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>IT
was great fun on Christmas morning. The children awoke early and tumbled out of
bed to look at the presents that were stacked on chairs near by. Squeals and
yells of delight came from everyone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh!
a railway station! Just what I wanted! Who gave me this marvellous station ?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'A
new doll - with eyes that shut! I shall call her Betsy-May. She looks just like
a Betsy-May!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
say - what a whopping great book - all about aeroplanes. From Aunt Fanny! How
decent of her!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Timothy!
Look what Julian has given you - a collar with big brass studs all round - you
will be grand. Go and lick him to say thank you!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Who's
this from? I say, who gave me this? Where's the label? Oh - from Mr. Roland.
How decent of him! Look, Julian, a pocket-knife with three blades!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
the cries and exclamations went on, and the four excited children and the
equally-excited dog spent a glorious hour before a late Christmas breakfast,
opening all kinds and shapes of parcels. The bedrooms were in a fine mess when
the children had finished!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Who
gave you that book about dogs, George ?' asked Julian, seeing rather a nice
dog-book lying on George's pile.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Mr.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Roland,' said George, rather shortly. Julian
80<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>wondered
if George was going to accept it. He rathei thought she wouldn't. But the little
girl, defiant and obstinate as she was, had made up her mind not to spoil
Christmas Day by being 'difficult'. So, when the others thanked the tutor for
their things she too added her thanks, though in rather a stiff little voice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
had not given the tutor anything, but the others had, and Mr. Roland thanked
them all very heartily, appearing to be very pleased indeed. He tolcl Anne that
her Christmas card was the nicest he had ever had, and she beamed at him with
joy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,
I must say it's nice to be here for Christmas!' said Mr. Roland, when he and
the others were sitting round a loaded Christmas table, at the mid-day dinner.
'Shall I carve for you, Mr. Quentin? I'm good at that!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Uncle
Quentin handed him the carving knife and fork gladly. 'It's nice to have you
here,' he said warmly. 'I must say you've settled in well - I'm sure we all
feel as if we've known you for ages!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
really was a jolly Christmas Day. There were no lessons, of course, and there
were to be none the next day either. The children gave themselves up to the
enjoyment of eating a great deal, sucking sweets, and looking forward to the
lighting of the Christmas tree.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
looked beautiful when the candles were lighted. They twinkled in the darkness
of the hall, and the bright ornaments shone and glowed. Tim sat and looked at
it, quite entranced.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'He
likes it as much as we do,' said George. And indeed Tim had enjoyed the whole
day just as much as any of the children.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
were all tired out when they went to bed. 'I shan't be long before I'm asleep,'
yawned Anne. 'Oh, George - it's been fun, hasn't it ? I did like the Christmas
tree.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Yes,
it's been lovely,' said George, jumping into bed. 'Here conies Mother to say
good night. Basket, Tim, basket!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Tim
leapt into his basket by the window. He was always there when George's mother
came in to say good night to the girls but as soon as she had gone downstairs,
the dog took a flying leap and landed on George's bed. There he slept, his head
curled round her feet.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Don't
you think Tim ought to sleep downstairs tonight?' said George's mother. 'Joanna
says he ate such an enormous meal in the kitchen that she is sure he will be
sick.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh
no, Mother!' said George, at once. 'Make Tim sleep downstairs on Christmas
night? Whatever would he think?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh,
very well,' said her mother, with a laugh. 'I might have known it was useless
to suggest it. Now go to sleep quickly, Anne and George - it's late and you are
all tired.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
went into the boys' room and said good night to them too. They were almost asleep.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Two
hours later everyone else was in bed. The house was still and dark. George and
Anne slept peacefully in their small beds. Timothy slept too, lying heavily on
George's feet.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Suddenly
George awoke with a jump. Tim was growl-<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>ing
softly! He had raised his big shaggy head and George knew that he was
listening.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'What
is it, Tim ?' she whispered. Anne did not wake. Tim went on growling softly.
George sat up and put her hand on his collar to stop him. She knew that if he
awoke her father, he would be cross.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timothy
stopped growling now that he had roused George. The girl sat and wondered what
to do. It wasn't any good waking Annfm The little girl would be frightened. Why
was Tint growling ? He never did that at night!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Perhaps
I'd better go and see if everything is all right,' thought Gpnrgf^ She was
quite fearless, and the thought pf creeping through the still, dark house did
not disturb her at all. Besides she had Tim! Who could be afraid with Tim
beside them!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
slipped on her dressing-gown. 'Perhaps a log has fallen out of one of the
fire-places and a rug is burning,' she thought, sniffing as she went down the
stairs. Tt would be just like Tim to smell it and warn us!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>With
her hand on Tim's head to warn him to be quite quiet, George crept softly
through the hall to the sitting-room. The fire was quite all right there, just
a red glow. In the kitchen all was peace too. Tim's feet made a noise there, as
his claws rattled against the linoleum.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
slight sound came from the other side of the house. Tim growled quite loudly,
and the hairs on the back of his neck rose up. George stood still. Could it
possibly be burglars?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Suddenly
Timothy shook himself free from her fingers and kapt across the hall, down a
passage, and into the<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>study
beyond! There was the sound of an exclamation, and a noise as if someone was
falling over.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'It
is a burglar!' said George, and she ran to the study. She saw a torch shining
on the floor, dropped by someone who was even now struggling with Tim.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
switched on the light, and then looked with the greatest astonishment into the
study. Mr. Roland was there in his dressing-gown, rolling on the floor, trying
to get away from Timothy, who, although not biting him, was holding him firmly
by his dressing-gown.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh
- it's you, George! Call your beastly dog off!' said Mr. Roland, in a low and
angry voice. 'Do you want to rouse all the household ?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Why
are you creeping about with a torch ?' demanded George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
heard a noise down here, and came to see what it was,' said Mr. Roland, sitting
up and trying to fend off the angry dog. 'For goodness' sake, call your beast
off.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Why
didn't you put on the light ?' asked George, not attempting to take Tim away.
She was very much enjoying the sight of an angry and frightened Mr. Roland.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
couldn't find it,' said the tutor. 'It's on the wrong side of the door, as you
see.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
was true. The switch was an awkward one to find if you didn't know it. Mr.
Roland tried to push Tim away again, and the dog suddenly barked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well
- he'll wake everyone!' said the tutor, angrily. 'I didn't want to rouse the
house. I thought I could find out for myself if there was anyone about - a
burglar perhaps. Here comes your father!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George's
father appeared, carrying a large poker. He<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>stood
still in astonishment when he saw Mr. Roland on the ground and Timothy standing
over him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'What's
all this?' he exclaimed. Mr. Roland tried to get up, but Tim would not let him.
George's father called to him sternly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Tim!
Come here, sir!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timothy
glanced at George to see if his mistress agreed with her father's command. She
said nothing. So Timothy took no notice of the order and merely made a snap at
Mr. Roland's ankles.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'That
dog's mad!' said Mr. Roland, from the floor. 'He's already bitten me once
before, and now he's trying to do it again!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Tim!
Will you come here, sir!' shouted George's father. 'George, that dog is really
disobedient. Call him off at once.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Come
here, Tim!' said George, in a low voice. The dog at once came to her, standing
by her side with the hairs on his neck still rising up stiffly. He growled
softly as if to say, 'Be careful, Mr. Roland, be careful!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
tutor got up. He was very angry indeed. He spoke to George's father.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
heard some sort of a noise and came down with my torch to see what it was,' he
said. 'I thought it came from your study, and knowing you kept your valuable
books and instruments here, I wondered if some thief was about. I had just got
down, and into the room, when that dog appeared from somewhere and got me down
on the ground! George came along too, and would not call him off.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
can't understand your behaviour, George; I really<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>can't,'
said her father, angrily. 'I hope you are not going to behave stupidly, as you
used to behave before your cousins came last summer. And what is this I hear
about Tim biting Mr. Roland before ?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'George
had him under the table during lessons,' said Mr. Roland. 'I didn't know that,
and when I stretched out my legs, they touched Tim, and he bit me. I didn't
tell you before, sir, because I didn't want to trouble you. Both George and the
dog have tried to annoy me ever since I have been here.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,
Tim must go outside and live in the kennel,' said George's father. 'I won't
have him in the house. It will be a punishment for him, and a punishment for
you too, George. I will not have this kind of behaviour. Mr. Roland has been
extremely kind to you all.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
won't let Tim live outside,' said George furiously. 'It's such cold weather,
and it would simply break his heart.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,
his heart must be broken then,' said her father. 'It will depend entirely on
your behaviour from now on whether Tim is allowed in the house at all these
holidays. I shall ask Mr. Roland each day how you have behaved. If you have a
bad report, then Tim stays outside. Now you know! Go back to bed but first
apologize to Mr. Roland!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
won't!' said George, and choked by feelings of anger and dismay, she tore out
of the room and up the stairs. The two men stared after her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Let
her be,' said Mr. Roland. 'She's a very difficult child - and has made up her mind
not to like me, that's quite plain. But I shall be very glad, sir, to know that<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>that
dog isn't in the house. I'm not at all certain that Georgina wouldn't set him
on me, if she could!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I'm
soiry about all this,' said George's father. 'I wonder what the noise was that
you heard - a log falling in the grate I expect. Now - what am I to do about
that tiresome dog tonight? Go and take him outside, I suppose!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Leave
him tonight,' said Mr. Roland. 'I can hear noises upstairs - the others are
awake by now! Don't let's make any more disturbance tonight.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Perhaps
you are right,' said George's father, thankfully. He didn't at all want to
tackle a defiant little girl and an angry big dog in the middle of a cold
night!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
two men went to bed and slept. George did not sleep. The others had been awake
when she got upstairs, and she had told them what had happened.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'George!
You really are an idiot!' said Dick. 'After all, why shouldn't Mr. Roland go
down if he heard a noise! You went down! Now we shan't have darling old Tim in
the house this cold weather!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
began to cry. She didn't like hearing that the tutor she liked so much had been
knocked down by Tim, and she hated hearing that Tim was to be punished.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Don't
be a baby,' said George. 'I'm not crying, and it's my dog!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But,
when everyone had settled down again in bed, and slept peacefully, George's
pillow was very wet indeed. Tim crept up beside her and licked the salt tears
off her cheek. He whined softly. Tim was always unhappy when his little
mistress was sad.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chapter
Nine<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
HUNT FOR THE SECRET WAY<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>THERE
were no lessons the next day. George looked rather pale, and was very quiet.
Tim was already out in the yard-kennel, and the children could hear him whining
unhappily. They were all upset to hear him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh,
George, I'm awfully sorry about it all,' said Dick. 'I wish you wouldn't get so
fierce about things. You only get yourself into trouble - and poor old Tim.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
was full of mixed feelings. She disliked Mr. Roland so much now that she could
hardly bear to look at him - and yet she did not dare to be openly rude and
rebellious because she was afraid that if she was, the tutor would give her a
bad report, and perhaps she would not be allowed even to see Timothy. It was
very hard for a defiant nature like hers to force herself to behave properly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr.
Roland took no notice of her at all. The other children tried to bring George
into their talks and plans, but she remained quiet and uninterested.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'George!
We're going over to Kirrin Farm-house today,' said Dick. 'Coming? We're going
to try and find the entrance to the Secret Way. It must start somewhere there.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children had told George what Mr. Roland had said about the piece of marked
linen. They had all been thrilled about this, though the excitements of Christmas
Day had made them forget about it for a while.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Yes
- of course I'll come,' said George, looking more cheerful. 'Timothy can come
too. He wants a walk.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
when the little girl found that Mr. Roland was also going, she changed her mind
at once. Not for anything would she go with the tutor! No - she would go for a
walk alone with Timothy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'But,
George - think of the excitement we'll have trying to find the Secret Way,'
said Julian, taking hold of her arm. George wrenched it away.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Tm
not going if Mr. Roland is,' she said, obstinately, and the others knew that it
was no good trying to coax her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
shall go alone with Tim,' said George. 'You go off together with your dear Mr.
Roland!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
set out with Timothy, a lonely little figure going down the garden path. The
others stared after her. This was horrid. George was being more and more left
out, but what could they do about it ?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,
children, are you ready?' asked Mr. Roland. 'You start off by yourselves, will
you? I'll meet you at the farm-house later. I want to run down to the village
first to get something.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
the three children set off by themselves, wishing that George was with them.
She was nowhere to be seen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Old
Mr. and Mrs. Sanders were pleased to see the itliree children, and sat them
down in the big kitchen to eat ginger buns and drink hot milk.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,
have you come to find a few more seciet things ?' asked Mrs. Sanders, with a
smile.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'May
we try?' asked Julian. 'We're looking for a room facing east, with a stone
floor, and panelling!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'All
the rooms downstairs have stone floors,' said Mrs. Sanders. 'You hunt all you
like, my dears. You won't do any damage, I know. But don't go into the room
upstairs with the cupboard that has a false back, will you, or the one next to
it! Those are the rooms the two artists have.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'All
right,' said Julian, rather soiry that they were unable to fiddle about with
the exciting cupboard again. 'Are the artists here, Mrs. Sanders? I'd like to
talk to them about pictures. I hope one day I'll be an artist too.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Dear
me, is that so ?' said Mrs Sanders. 'Well, well -it's always a marvel to me how
people make any money at painting pictures.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'It
isn't making money that artists like, so much as the painting of the pictures,'
said Julian, looking rather wise. That seemed to puzzle Mrs. Sanders even more.
She shook her head and laughed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'They're
queer folk!' she said. 'Ah well - you go along and have a hunt for whatever it
is you want to find. You can't talk to the two artists today though, Master
Julian -they're out.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children finished their buns and milk and then stood up, wondering where to
begin their search. They must look for a room or rooms facing east. That would
be the first thing to do.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Which
side of the house faces east, Mrs. Sanders?' asked Julian. 'Do you know ?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'The
kitchen faces due north,' said Mrs. Sanders. 'So east will be over there.' she
pointed to the right.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Thanks,'
said Julian. 'Come on, everyone!' The three<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>children
went out of the kitchen, and turned to the right. There were three rooms there
- a kind of scullery, not much used now, a tiny room used as a den by old Mr. f
Sanders, and a room that had once been a drawing-room, but which was now cold
and unused.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'They've
all got stone floors,' said Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'So
we'll have to hunt through all of the three rooms,' said Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'No,
we won't,' said Julian. 'We shan't have to look in this scullery, for one
thing!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Why
not?'asked Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Because
the walls are of stone, silly, and we want panelling,' said Julian. 'Use your
brains, Anne!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,
that's one room we needn't bother with, then,' said Dick. 'Look - both this
little room and the drawing-room have panelling, Julian. We must search in
both.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'There
must be some reason for putting dight squares of panelling in the directions,'
said Julian, looking at the roll of linen again. 'It would be a good idea to
see whether there's a place with eight squares only - you know, over a window,
or something.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was tremendously exciting to look round the two rooms! The children began with
the smaller room. It was panelled all the way round in dark oak, but there was
no place where only eight panels showed. So the children went into the next
room.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
panelling there was different. It did not look so old, and was not so dark. The
squares were rather a different size, too. The children tried each panel,
tapping and pressing as they went, expecting at any moment<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>to
see one slide back as the one in the hall had done.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
they were disappointed. Nothing happened at all. They were still in the middle
of trying when they heard footsteps in the hall, and voices. Somebody looked
into the drawing-room. It was a man, thin and tall, wearing glasses on his long
nose.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Hallo!'
he said. 'Mrs. Sanders told me you were treasure-hunting, or something. How are
you getting on?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Not
very well,' said Julian, politely. He looked at the man, and saw behind him
another one, younger, with rather screwed-up eyes and a big mouth. 'I suppose
you are the two artists ?' he asked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'We
are!' said the first man, coming into the room. 'Now, just exactly what are you
looking for ?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
did not really want to tell him, but it was difficult not to. 'Well - we're
just seeing if there's a sliding panel here,' he said at last. 'There's one in
the hall, you know. It's exciting to hunt round.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Shall
we help?' said the first artist, coming into the room. 'What are your names?
Mine's Thomas, and my friend's name is Wilton.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children talked politely for a minute or two, not at all wanting the two men to
help. If there was anything to be found, they wanted to find it. It would spoil
everything if grown-ups solved the puzzle!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Soon
everyone was tap-tap-tapping round the wooden panels. They were in the middle
of this when a voice hailed them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Hallo!
My word, we are all busy!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children turned, and saw their tutor standing in<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the
doorway, smiling at them. The two artists looked at him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Is
this a friend of yours ?' asked Mr. Thomas.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Yes
- he's our tutor, and he's very nice!' said Anne, running to Mr. Roland and
putting her hand in his.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Perhaps
you will introduce me, Anne,' said Mr. Roland, smiling at the little girl.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
knew how to introduce people. She had often seen her mother doing it. 'This is
Mr. Roland,' she said to the two artists. Then she turned to Mr. Roland. 'This
is Mr. Thomas,' she said, waving her hand towards him, 'and the other one is
Mr. Wilton.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
men half-bowed to one another and nodded. 'Are you staying here?' asked Mr.
Roland. 'A very nice old farm-house, isn't it ?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'It
isn't time to go yet, is it ?' asked Julian, hearing a clock strike.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Yes,
I'm afraid it is,' said Mr. Roland. Tin later meeting you than I expected. We
must go in about five minutes - no later. I'll just give you a hand in trying
to find this mysterious secret way!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
no matter how anyone of them pressed and tapped around the panels in either of
the two rooms, they could not find anything exciting. It really was most
disappointing<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,
we really must go now,' said Mr. Roland. 'Come and say good-bye to Mrs.
Sanders.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all went into the warm kitchen, where Mrs. Sanders was cooking something that
smelt most delicious.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Something
for our lunch, Mrs. Sanders?' said Mr.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Wilton.
'My word, you really are a wonderful cook!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mrs.
Sanders smiled. She turned to the children. 'Well, dearies, did you find what
you wanted ?' she asked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'No,'
said Mr. Roland, answering for them. 'We haven't been able to find the secret
way, after all!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'The
secret way?' said Mrs. Sanders, in surprise. 'What do you know about that now?
I thought it had all been forgotten - in fact, I haven't believed in that
secret way for many a year!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh,
Mrs, Sanders - do you know about it?' cried Julian. 'Where is it ?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
don't know, dear - the secret of it has been lost for<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>many
a day,' said the old lady. 'I remember my old grandmother telling me something
about it when I was smaller than any of you. But I wasn't interested in things
like that when I was little. I was all for cows and hens<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>and
sheep.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh,
Mrs. Sanders - do, do try and remember something!' begged Dick. 'What was the
secret way ?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,

that their morning had been wasted. , George was indoors when they got to
Kirrin Cottage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

cheeks were not so pale, now, and she greeted the<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>children
eagerly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Did
you discover anything? Tell me all about it!' she<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'There's
nothing to tell,' said Dick, rather gloomily. 'We found three rooms facing
east, with stone floors, but only two of them had wooden panelling, so we
hunted round those, tapping and punching - but there wasn't anything to be
discovered at all.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'We
saw the two artists,' said Anne. 'One was tall and thin, and had a long nose
with glasses on. He was called Mr. Thomas. The other was younger, with little
piggy eyes and an enormous mouth.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
met them out this morning,' said George. 'It must have been them. Mr. Roland
was with them, and they were all talking together. They didn't see me.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh,
it couldn't have been the artists you saw,' said Anne, at once. 'Mr. Roland
didn't know them. I had to introduce them.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,
I'm sure I heard Mr. Roland call one of them Wilton,' said George, puzzled.
'lie must have known them.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'It
couldn't have been the artists,' said Anne, again. 'They really didn't know Mr.
Roland. Mr. Thomas asked if he was a friend of ours.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I'm
sure I'm not mistaken,' said George, looking obstinate. 'If Mr. Roland said he
didn't know the two artists, he was telling lies.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh,
you're always making out that he is doing something horrid!' cried Anne,
indignantly. 'You just make up things about him!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Sh!'
said Julian. 'Here he is.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
door opened and the tutor came in. 'Well,' he said, 'it was disappointing that
we couldn't find the secret way, wasn't it! Anyway, we were rather foolish to
hunt<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>about
that drawing-room as we did — the panelling there wasn't really old - it must
have been put in years after the other.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh
- well, it's no good looking there again,' said Julian, disappointed. 'And I'm
pretty sure there's nothing to be found in that other little room. We went all
over it so thoroughly. Isn't it disappointing ?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'It
Js,' said Mr. Roland. 'Well, Julian, how did you like the two artists? I was
pleased to meet them - they seemed nice fellows, and I shall like to know
them.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
looked at the tutor. Could he possibly be telling untruths in such a truthful
voice ? The little girl was very puzzled. She felt sure it was the artists she
had seen him with. But why should he pretend he didn't know them ? She must be
mistaken. But all the same, she felt uncomfortable about it, and made up her
mind to find out the truth, if she could.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

SHOCK FOR GEORGE AND TIM<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>NEXT
morning there were lessons again - and no Timothy , under the table! George
felt very much inclined to refuse i to work, but what would be the good of that
? Grown-ups 5 were so powerful, and could dole out all kinds of punishments.
She didn't care how much she was punished her-,' self but she couldn't bear to
think that Timothy might have to share in the punishments too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So,
pale and sullen, the little girl sat down at the table with the others. Anne
was eager to join in the lessons - in , fact she was eager to do anything to
please Mr. Roland, \ because he had given her the fairy doll from the top of
\the Christmas tree! Anne thought she was the prettiest \ doll she had ever
seen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

showed it to her. She didn't like dolls, and she certainly wasn't going to like
one that Mr. Roland had chosen, and given \ to Anne! But Anne loved it, and had
made up her mind &gt; to do lessons with the others, and work as well as she<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>could.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
did as little as she could without getting into trouble. Mr. Roland took no
interest in her or in her work. He praised the others, and took a lot of
trouble ' to show Julian something he found difficult.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The<span

troubled them very much, for Timothy<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>was
such a companion, and so dear to them all. They could not bear to think of him
left out of everything, cold and miserable in the yard-kennel. When the ten
minutes' break came, and Mr. Roland went out of the room for a few minutes,
Julian spoke to George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'George!
It's awful for us to hear poor old Tim whining out there in the cold. And I'm
sure I heard him cough. Let me speak to Mr. Roland about him. You must feel
simply dreadful knowing that Tim is out there.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
thought I heard him cough, too,' said George, looking worried. 'I hope he won't
get a cold. He simply doesn't understand why I have to put him there. He thinks
I'm terribly unkind.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
little girl turned her head away, afraid that tears might come into her eyes.
She always boasted that she never cried - but it was very difficult to keep the
tears away when she thought of Timothy out there in the cold.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
took her arm. 'Listen, George - you just hate Mr. Roland, and I suppose you
can't help it. But we can none of us bear Timothy being out there all alone -
and it looks like snow today, which would be awful for him. Could you be
awfully, awfully good today, and forget your dislike, so that when your father
asks Mr. Roland for your report, he can say you were very good - and then we'll
all ask Mr. Roland if he wouldn't let Timmy come back into the house.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'See?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timothy
coughed again, out in the yard, and George's heart went cold. Suppose he got
that awful illness called pneumonia - and she couldn't nurse him because he had<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>to
live in the kennel ? She would die of unhappiness! She turned to Julian and
Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'All
right,' she said. 'I do hate Mr. Roland - but I love Timothy more than I hate
the tutor - so for Tim's sake I'll pretend to be good and sweet and
hard-working. And then you can beg him to let Timothy come back.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Good
girl!' said Julian. 'Now here he comes - so do your best.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>To
the tutor's enormous surprise, George gave him a smile when he came into the
room. This was so unexpected that it puzzled him. He was even more puzzled to
find that George worked harder than anyone for the rest of the morning, and she
answered politely and cheerfully when he spoke to her. He gave her a word of
praise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well
done, Georgina! I can see you've got brains.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Thank
you,&quot; said George, and gave him another smile - a very watery, poor
affair, compared with the happy smiles the others had been used to - but still,
it was a smile!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At
dinner-time George looked after Mr. Roland most politely - passed him the salt,
offered him more bread, got up to fill his glass when it was empty! The others
looked at her in admiration. George had plenty of pluck. She must be finding it
very difficult to behave as if Mr. Roland was a great friend, when she really
disliked him so much!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr.
Roland seemed very pleased, and appeared to be quite willing to respond to
George's friendliness. He made a little joke with her, and offered to lend her
a<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>book
he had about a dog. George's mother was delighted to find that her difficult
daughter seemed to be turning over a new leaf. Altogether things were very much
happier that day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'George,
you go out of the room before your father comes in to ask Mr. Roland about your
behaviour tonight,' said Julian. 'Then, when the tutor gives you a splendid
report, we will all ask if Timothy can come back. It will be easier if you are
not there.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'All
right,' said George. She was longing for this difficult day to be over. It was
very hard for her to pretend to be friendly, when she was not. She could never
never do it, if it wasn't for Timothy's sake!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
disappeared out of the room just before six o'clock, when she heard her father
coming. He walked into the room and nodded to Mr. Roland.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well?
Have your pupils worked well today?' he asked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Very
well indeed,' said Mr. Roland. 'Julian has really mastered something he didn't
understand today. Dick has done well in Latin. Anne has written out a French
exercise without a single mistake!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'And
what about George ?' asked Uncle Quentin.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
was coming to Georgina,' said Mr. Roland, looking round and seeing that she was
gone. 'She has worked better than anyone else today! I am really pleased with
her. She has tried hard - and she has really been polite and friendly. I feel
she is trying to turn over a new leaf.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'She's
been a brick today,' said Julian, warmly. 'Uncle Quentin, she has tried awfully
hard, she really has. And, you know, she's terribly unhappy.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Why
?' asked Uncle Quentin in surprise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Because
of Timothy,' said Julian. 'He's out in the cold, you see. And he's got a
dreadful cough.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh,
Uncle Quentin, please do let poor Timmy come indoors,' begged Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Yes,
please do,' said Dick. 'Not only for George's sake, because she loves him so,
but for us too. We hate to hear him whining outside. And George does deserve a
reward, Uncle - she's been marvellous today.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,'
said Uncle Quentin, looking doubtfully at the three eager faces before him,
'well - I hardly know what to say. If George is going to be sensible - and the
weather gets colder - well...'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
looked at Mr. Roland, expecting to hear him say something in favour of Timothy.
But the tutor said noth-JF<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>ing. He
looked annoyed. |<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>       </span>'What do you
think, Roland?' asked Uncle Quentin.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
think you should keep to what you said and let the dog stay outside,' said the
tutor. 'George is spoilt, and needs firm handling. You should really keep to
your decision about the dog. There is no reason to give way about it just
because she has tried to be good for once!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
three children stared at Mr. Roland in surprise and dismay. It had never
entered their heads that he would not back them up!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh,
Mr. Roland, you are horrid!' cried Anne. 'Oh, do, do say you'll have Timothy
back.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
tutor did not look at Anne. He pursed up his mouth beneath its thick moustache
and looked straight at Uncle Quentin.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,'
said Uncle Quentin, 'perhaps we had better<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>see
how George behaves for a whole week. After all -just one day isn't much.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children stared at him in disgust. They thought he was weak and unkind. Mr.
Roland nodded his head.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Yes,'
he said, 'a week will be a better test. If Georgina behaves well for a whole
week, we'll have another word about the dog, sir. But at present I feel it
would be better to keep him outside.' '<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Very
well,' said Uncle Quentin, and went out of the room. He paused to look back.
'Come along into my study sometime,' he said. 'I've got a bit further with my
formula. It's at a very interesting stage.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
three children looked at one another but said nothing. How mean of the tutor to
stop Uncle Quentin from having Timothy indoors again,! They all felt
disappointed in him. The tutor saw their faces.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I'm
sorry to disappoint you,' he said. 'But I think if you'd been bitten by Timothy
once and snapped at all over when he got you on the floor, you would not be
very keen on having him in either!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
went out of the room. The children wondered what to say to George. She came in
a moment later, her face eager. But when she saw the gloomy looks of the other
three, she stopped short.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Isn't
Tim to come in?' she asked, quickly. 'What's happened ? Tell me!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
told her. The little girl's face grew dark and angry when she heard how the
tutor had put his foot down about Timothy, even when her father had himself
suggested that the dog might come indoors.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh,
what a beast he is!' she cried. 'How I do hate him! I'll pay him out for this.
I will, I will!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
rushed out of the room. They heard her fumbling in the hall, and then the front
door banged.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'She's
gone out into the dark,' said Julian. *I bet she's gone to Timmy. Poor old
George. Now she'll be worse than ever!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>That
night George could not sleep. She lay and tossed in her bed, listening for
Timothy. She heard him cough. She heard him whine. He was cold, she knew he
was. She had put plenty of fresh straw into his kennel and had turned it away
from the cold north wind - but he must feel the bitter night terribly, after
sleeping for so long on her bed!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timothy
gave such a hollow cough that George could bear it no longer. She must, she
simply must, get up and go down to him. 'I shall bring him into the house for a
little while and rub his chest with some of that stuff Mother uses for herself
when she's got a cold on her chest,' thought the girl. 'Perhaps that will do
him good.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
quickly put a few clothes on and crept downstairs. The whole house was quiet.
She slipped out into the yard and undid Tim's chain. He was delighted to see
her and licked her hands and face lovingly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Come
along into the warm for a little while,' whispered the little girl. Til rub
your poor chest with some oil I've got.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
pattered behind her into the house. She took him to the kitchen - but the fire
was out and the room was cold. George went to look at the other rooms.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was quite a nice fire still in her father's study.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the firelight was fairly bright. She had with her the little bottle of oil from

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then
she rubbed the dog's hairy chest with the oil, hoping it would do him good.
'Don't cough now if you can help it, Tim,' she whispered. 'If you do, someone f

Your cold will soon be better.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

firelight glinted on the curious instruments and jf glass tubes that stood
around on shelves in her father's j study. A log shifted a little in the fire

peacefully, happy and warm.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
settled down with her head on his neck. She awoke to hear the study clock
striking six! The room was cold now, and she shivered. Goodness! Six o'clock!
Joanna the cook would soon be awake. She must not find Timmy and George in the
study!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Tim
darling! Wake up! We must put you back into your kennel,' whispered George. 'Im
sure your cold is better, because you haven't coughed once since you've been
indoors. Get up - and don't make a noise. Sh!' Tim stood up and shook himself.
He licked George's hand. He understood perfectly that he must be quite<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>quiet.
The two of them slipped out of the study, went into the hall and out of the
front door.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
a minute or two Timothy was on the chain, and in his kennel, cuddled down among
the straw. George wished she could cuddle there with him. She gave him a pat
and slipped back indoors again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
went up to bed, sleepy and cold. She forgot that she was partly dressed and got
into bed just as she was. She was asleep in a moment!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Look!'

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Be
quiet,' said George. 'I went down and let Tim in last night. We sat in front of
the study fire and I rubbed him with oil. Now don't you dare to say a word to
anyone! Promise!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'GEORGE,
don't behave fiercely today, will you?' said Julian, after breakfast. 'It won't
do you or Timothy aay good at all.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Do
you suppose I'm going to behave well when I know perfectly well that Mr. Roland
will never let me have Tim indoors all these holidays ?' said George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well
- they said a week,' said Dick. 'Can't you try for a week ?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'No.
At the end of a week Mr. Roland will say I must try for another week,' said
George. 'He's got a real dislike for poor Tim. And for me too. I'm not surprised
at that, because I know that when I try to be horrid, I really am horrid. But
he shouldn't hate poor Timmy.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh
George - you'll spoil the whole holls if you are silly, and keep getting into
trouble,' said Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,
I'll spoil them then,' said George, the sulky look coming back on her face.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
don't see why you have to spoil them for us, as well as for yourself,' said
Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'They
don't need to be spoilt for you,' said George. 'You can have all the fun you
want - go for walks with your dear Mr. Roland, play games with him in the
evening, and laugh and talk as much as you like. You don't need to take any
notice of me.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'You
are a funny girl, George,' said Julian, with a 112<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>sigh.
'We like you, and we hate you to be unhappy — so how can we have fun if we know
you are miserable - and Timmy too ?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Don't
worry about me' said George, in rather a choky voice. Tm going out to Tim. I'm
not corning in to lessons today.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'George!
But you must!' said Dick and Julian together.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'There's
no &quot;Must&quot; about it,' said George. Tm just not coming. I won't work
with Mr. Roland till he says I can have Timothy indoors again.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'But
you know you can't do things like that - you'll be spanked or something,' said
Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
shall run away if things get too bad,' said George, in a shaky voice. 'I shall
run away with Tim.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
went out of the room and shut the door with a bang. The others stared after
her. What could you do with a person like George ? Anyone could rule her with
kindness and understanding - but as soon as she came up against anyone who
disliked her, or whom she disliked, she shied away like a frightened horse -
and kicked like a frightened horse, too!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr.
Roland came into the sitting-room, his books in his hand. He smiled at the
three children.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well?
All ready for me, I see. Where's George?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Nobody
answered. Nobody was going to give George away!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Don't
you know where she is?' asked Mr. Roland in surprise. He looked at Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'No,
sir,' said Julian, truthfully. 'I've no idea where she is.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well
— perhaps she will come along in a few minutes,' said Mr. Roland. 'Gone to feed
that dog of hers, I suppose.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all settled down to work. The time went on and George did not come in. Mr.
Roland glanced at the clock and made an impatient clicking noise with his
tongue.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Really,
it's too bad of George to be so late! Anne, go and see if you can find her.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
went. She looked in the bedroom. There was no George there. She looked in the
kitchen. Joanna was there, making cakes. She gave the little girl a hot piece
to eat. She had no idea where George was.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
couldn't find her anywhere. She went back and told Mr. Roland. He looked angry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
shall have to report this to her father,' he said. 'I have never had to deal
with such a rebellious child before. She seems to do everything she possibly
can to get herself into trouble.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Lessons
went on. Break came, and still George did not appear. Julian slipped out and
saw that the yard-kennel was empty. So George had gone out with Timmy! What a
row she would get into when she got back!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>No
sooner had the children settled down after Break to do the rest of the
morning's lessons, than a big disturbance came.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Uncle
Quentin burst into the room, looking upset and worried.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Have
any of you children been into my study?' he asked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'No,
Uncle Quentin,' they all answered.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'You
said we weren't to,' said Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Why,
sir? Has something been broken?' asked Mr. Roland.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Yes
- the test-tubes I set yesterday for an experiment have been broken - and what
is worse, three most important pages of my book have gone,' said Uncle Quentin.
'I can write them out again, but only after a great deal of work. I can't
understand it. Are you sure, children, that none of you has been meddling with
things in my study?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Quite
sure,' they answered. Anne went very red -she suddenly remembered what George
had told her. George said she had taken Timmy into Uncle Quentin's study last
night, and rubbed his chest with oil! But George couldn't possibly have broken
the test-tubes, and taken pages from her father's book!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr.
Roland noticed that Anne had gone red.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Do
you know anything about this, Anne ?' he asked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'No,
Mr. Roland,' said Anne, blushing even redder, and looking very uncomfortable
indeed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Where's
George ?' suddenly said Uncle Quentin.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children said nothing, and it was Mr. Roland who answered:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'We
don't know. She didn't come to lessons this morning.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Didn't
come to lessons! Why not?' demanded Uncle Quentin, beginning to frown.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'She
didn't say,' said Mr. Roland dryly. 'I imagine she was upset because we were
firm about Timothy last night, sir — and this is her way of being defiant.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'The
naughty girl!' said George's father, angrily. 'I<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>don't
know what's come over her lately. Fanny! Come here! Did you know that George
hasn't been in to her lessons today ?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Aunt
Fanny came into the room. She looked very worried. She held a little bottle in
her hand. The children wondered what it was.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Didn't
come in to lessons!' repeated Aunt Fanny. 'How extraordinary! Then wheie is she
?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
don't think you need to worry about her,' said Mr. Roland, smoothly. 'She's
probably gone off with Timothy in a fit of temper. What is very much more
important, sir, is the fact that your work appears to have been spoilt by
someone. I only hope it is not George, who has been spiteful enough to pay you
out for not allowing her to have her dog in the house.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Of
course it wasn't George!' cried Dick, angry that anyone should even think such
a thing of his cousin.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'George
would never, never do a thing like that,' said Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'No,
she never would,' said Anne, sticking up valiantly for her cousin, although a
horrid doubt was in her mind. After all - George had been in the study last
night!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Quentin,
I am sine George would not even think of such a thing,' said Aunt Fanny. 'You
will find those pages somewhere — and as for the test-tubes that were broken,
well, perhaps the wind blew the curtain against them, or something! When did
you last see those pages?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Last
night,' said Uncle Quentin. 'I read them over again, and checked my figures to
make sure they were<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>right.
These pages contain the very heart of my formula! If they got into anyone
else's hands, they could use my secret. This is a terrible thing for me! I must
know what has happened to them.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
found this in your study, Quentin,' said Aunt Fanny, and she held up the little
bottle she carried. 'Did you put it there ? It was in the fender.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Uncle
Quentin took the bottle and stared at it. 'Camphorated oil!' he said. 'Of
course I didn't take it there. Why should I?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well
- who took it there, then?' asked Aunt Fanny, puzzled. 'None of the children
has a cold - and anyway, they wouldn't think of the camphorated oil, and take
it into the study to use! It's most extraordinary!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
was astonished. Why should a bottle of camphorated oil appear in the study
fender ?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Only
one person could think why. It suddenly came into Anne's mind in a flash.
George had said she had taken Timmy into the study, and rubbed him with oil! He
had had a cough, that was why. And she had left the oil in the study. Oh dear,
oh dear - now what would happen? What a pity George had forgotten the oil!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
went very red again as she looked at the oil. Mr. Roland, whose eyes seemed
very sharp this morning, looked hard at the little girl.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Anne!
You know something about that oil!' he said suddenly. 'What do you know? Did
you put it there?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'No,'
said Anne. 'I haven't been into the study. I said I hadn't.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Do
you know anything about the oil?' said Mr. Roland, again. 'You do know
something.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Everyone stared at Anne. She stared back. This
was simply dreadful. She could not give George away. She could not. George was
in quite enough trouble as it was,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>without
getting into any more. She pursed up her little mouth and did not answer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Anne!'
said Mr. Roland, sternly. 'Answer when you are spoken to.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>night
before.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Anne,
dear,' said her aunt, gently. 'Tell us if you know something. It might help us
to find out what has happened to Uncle Quentin's papers. It is very, very,
important.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Still
Anne said nothing. Her eyes filled with tears. Julian squeezed her arm.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Don't
bother Anne,' he said to the grown-ups. 'If she thinks she can't tell you,
she's got some very good reason.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
think she's shielding George,' said Mr. Roland. 'Is that it, Anne?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
burst into tears. Julian put his arms round his little sister, and spoke again
to the three grown-ups.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Don't
bother Anne! Can't you see she's upset ?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'We'll
let George speak for herself, when she thinks will come in,' said Mr. Roland.
'I'm sure she knows how that bottle got there - and if she put it there herself
must have been into the study - and she's the only person that has been there.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boys could not think for one moment that George would do such a thing as spoil
her father's work. Anne feared it, and it upset her. She sobbed in Julian's
amis.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'When
George comes in, send her to me in my study,' said Uncle Quentin, irritably.
'How can a man work when these upsets go on? I was always against having
children in the house.' ,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
stamped out, tall, cross and frowning. The children were glad to see him go.
Mr. Roland shut the books on the table with a snap.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'We
can't do any more lessons this morning,' he said. Tut on your things and go out
for a walk till dinner-time.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Yes,

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr.
Roland and their aunt went out of the room. 'I don't know if Mr. Roland thinks
he's coming out with us,' said Julian, in a low voice, 'but we've got to get
out first and give him the slip. We've got to find George and warn her what's
up.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Right!'
said Dick. 'Dry your eyes, Anne darling. Hurry and get your things. We'll slip
out of the garden door before Mr. Roland comes down. I bet George has gone for
her favourite walk over the cliffs. We'll meet her!' The three children threw
on their outdoor things and crept out of the garden door quietly. They raced
down the garden path, and out of the gate before Mr. Roland even knew they were
gone! They made their way to the cliffs, and looked to see if George was
coming.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'There
she is - and Timothy, too!' cried Julian, pointing. 'George! George! Quick,
we've got something to tell you!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chapter
Twelve GEORGE IN TROUBLE<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'WHAT'S
the matter ?' asked George, as the three children tore up to her. 'Has
something happened ?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Yes,
George. Someone has taken three most important pages out of your father's
book!' panted Julian. 'And broken the test-tubes he was making an experiment
with. Mr. Roland thinks you might have had something to do with it!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'The
beast!' said George, her blue eyes deepening with anger. 'As if I'd do a thing
like that! Why should he think it's me, anyway ?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,
George, you left that bottle of oil in the study fender,' said Anne. 'I haven't
told anyone at all what you told me happened last night - but somehow Mr.
Roland guessed you had something to do with the bottle of oil.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Didn't
you tell the boys how I got Timmy indoors ?' asked George. 'Well, there's
nothing much to tell, Julian, I just heard poor old Tim coughing in the night,
and I half-dressed, went down, and took him into the study, where there was a
fire. Mother keeps a bottle of oil that she used to rub her chest wfth when she
has a cough -so I thought it might do Timmy's cold good, too. I got the oil and
rubbed him well - and we both fell asleep by the fire till six o'clock. I was
sleepy when I woke up, and forgot the oil. That's all.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'And
you didn't take any pages from the book Uncle Quentin is writing, and you
didn't break anything in the study, did you ?' said Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Of
course not, silly,' said George, indignantly. 'How can you ask me a thing like
that? You must be mad.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
never told a lie, and the others always believed her, whatever she said. They
stared at her, and she stared back.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
wonder who could have taken those pages then?' said Julian. 'Maybe your father
will come across them, after all. I expect he put them into some safe place and
then forgot all about them. And the test-tubes might easily have over-balanced
and broken themselves. Some of them look very shaky to me.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
suppose I shall get into trouble now for taking Tim into the study,' said
George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'And
for not coming into lessons this morning,' said Dick. 'You really are an idiot,
George. I never knew anyone like you for walking right into trouble.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Hadn't
you better stay out a bit longer, till everyone has calmed down a bit ?' said
Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'No,'
said George at once. 'If I'm going to get into a row, I'll get into it now! I'm
not afraid!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
marched over the cliff path, with Timmy running round her as usual. The others
followed. It wasn't nice to think that George was going to get into such
trouble.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
came to the house and went up the path.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr.
Roland saw them from the window and opened the door. He glanced at George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Your
father wants to see you in the study,' said the<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>tutor.
Then he turned to the others, looking annoyed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Why
did you go out without me? I meant to go with you.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh
did you, sir? I'm sorry,' said Julian, politely, not looking at Mr. Roland. 'We
just went out on the cliff a little way.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Georgina,
did you go into the study last night?' asked Mr. Roland, watching George as she
took off her hat and coat.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Til
answer my father's questions, not yours,' said George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'What
you want is a good spanking,' said Mr. Roland. 'And if I were your father I'd
give it to you!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'You're
not my father,' answered George. She went to the study door and opened it.
There was no one there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Father
isn't here,' said George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'He'll
be there in a minute,' said Mr. Roland. 'Go in and wait. And you others, go up
and wash for lunch.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
other three children felt almost as if they were deserting George as they went
up the stairs. They could hear Timmy whining from the yard outside. He knew his
little mistress was in trouble, and he wanted to be with her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
sat down on a chair, and gazed at the fire, remembering how she had sat on the
rug there with Tim last night, rubbing his hairy chest. How silly of her to
have forgotten the bottle of oil!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Her
father came into the room, frowning and angry. He looked sternly at George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Were
you in here last night, George ?' he asked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Yes,
I was,' answered George at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'What
were you doing in here?' asked her father. 'You know you children are forbidden
to come into my study.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
know,' said George. 'But you see Timmy had a dreadful cough, and I couldn't
bear it. So I crept down about one o'clock and let him in. This was the only
room that was really warm, so I sat here and rubbed his chest with the oil
Mother uses when she has a cold.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Rubbed
the dog's chest with camphorated oil!' exclaimed her father, in amazement.
'What a mad thing to do! As if it would do him any good.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'It
didn't seem mad to me,' said George. 'It seemed sensible. And Timmy's cough is
much better today. I'm sorry for coming into the study. I didn't touch a thing,
of course.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'George,
something very serious has happened,' said her father, looking gravely at her.
'Some of my test-tubes with which I was doing an important experiment, have
been broken - and, worse than that, three pages of my book have gone. Tell me
on your honour that you know nothing of these things.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
know nothing of them,' said George, looking her father straight in the eyes.
Her own eyes shone very blue and clear as she gazed at him. He felt quite
certain that George was speaking the truth. She could know nothing of the
damage done. Then where were those pages ?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'George,
last night when I went to bed at eleven o'clock, everything was in order,' he
said. 'I read over those three important pages and checked them once more
myself. This morning they are gone.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Then
they must have been taken between eleven o'clock and one o'clock,' said George.
'I was here from that time until six.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'But
who could have taken them?' said her father. 'The window was fastened, as far
as I know. And nobody knows that those three pages were so important but
myself. It is most extraordinary.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Mr.
Roland probably knew,' said George, slowly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Don't
be absurd,' said her father. 'Even if he did realize they were important, he
would not have taken them. He's a very decent fellow. And that reminds me -why
were you not at lessons this morning, George ?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I'm
not going to do lessons any more with Mr. Roland,' said George. 'I simply hate
him!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'George!
I will not have you talking like this!' said her father. 'Do you want me to say
you are to lose Tim altogether?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'No,'
said George, feeling shaky about the knees. 'And I don't think it's fair to
keep trying to force me to do things by threatening me with losing Timothy. If
- if -you do a thing like that - I'll - I'll run away or something!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
were no tears in George's eyes. She sat bolt upright on her chair, gazing
defiantly at her father. How difficult she was! Her father sighed, and
remembered that he too in his own childhood had been called 'difficult'.
Perhaps George took after him. She could be so good and sweet - and here she
was being perfectly impossible!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Her
father did not know what to do with George. He thought he had better have a
word with his wife. He got up and went to the door.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Stay
here. I shall be back in a moment. I want to speak to your mother about you.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Don't
speak to Mr. Roland about me, will you ?' said George, who felt quite certain
that the tutor would urge terrible punishments for her and Timmy. 'Oh, Father,
if only Timothy had been in the house last night, sleeping in my room as usual,
he would have heard whoever it was that stole your secret - and he would have
barked and roused the house!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Her
father said nothing, but he knew that what George had said was true. Timmy
wouldn't have let anyone get into the study. It was funny he hadn't barked in
the night, if anyone from outside had climbed in at the study window. Still, it
was the other side of the house. Maybe he had heard nothing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
door closed. George sat still on her chair, gazing up at the mantelpiece, where
a clock ticked away the time. She felt very miserable. Everything was going
wrong, every single thing!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
she gazed at the panelled overmantel, she counted the wooden panels. There were
eight. Now, where had she heard of eight panels before? Of course - in that
Secret Way. There were eight panels marked on the roll of linen. What a pity
there had not been eight panels in a wooden over-mantel at Kirrin Farm-house!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
glanced out of the window, and wondered if it faced «ast. She looked to see
where the sun was - it was not shining into the room - but it did in the early
morning - so it must face east. Fancy - her-e was a room facing east and with
eight wooden panels. She wondered if it had a stone floor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
floor was covered with a large thick carpet. George got up and went to the
wall. She pulled up the edge of the carpet there - and saw that the floor
underneath was made of large flat stones. The study had a stone floor too!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
sat down again and gazed at the wooden panels, trying to remember which one in
the roll of linen was marked with a cross. But of course it couldn't be a room
in Kirrin Cottage - it must be in Kirrin Farm-house where the Secret Way began.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
just suppose it was Kirrin Cottage! Certainly the directions had been found in
Kirrin Farm-house - but that was not to say that the Secret Way had to begin
there, even though Mrs. Sanders seemed to think it did.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
was feeling excited. 'I must tap round about those eight panels and try to find
the one that is marked on the linen roll,' she thought. 'It may slide back or
something, and I shall suddenly see the entrance opening!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
got up to try her luck - but at that moment the door opened again and her
father came in. He looked very grave.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
have been talking to your mother,' he said. 'She agrees with me that you have
been very disobedient, rude and defiant. We can't let behaviour like that pass,
George. You will have to be punished.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
looked anxiously at her father. If only her punishment had nothing to do with
Timothy! But, of course, it had.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'You
will go to bed for the rest of the day, and you will not see Timothy for three
days,' said her father. 'I will get Julian to feed him and take him for a walk.
If you persist in being defiant, Timothy will have to go away<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>altogether.
I am afraid, queer as it may seem, that thai, dog has a bad influence on you.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'He
hasn't, he hasn't!' cried George. 'Oh, he'll be so miserable if I don't see him
for three whole days.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'There's
nothing more to be said,' said her father. 'Go straight upstairs to bed, and
think over all I have said to you, George. I am very disappointed in your
behaviour these holidays. I really did think the influence of your three
cousins had made you into a normal, sensible girl. Now you are worse than you
have ever been.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
held open the door and George walked out, holding her head high. She heard the
others having their dinner in the dining-room. She went straight upstairs and
undressed. She got into bed and thought miserably of not seeing Tim for three
days. She couldn't bear it! Nobody could possibly know how much she loved
Timothy!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Joanna
came up with a tray of dinner. 'Well, Miss, it's a pity to see you in bed,' she
said cheerfully. 'Now you be a sensible girl and behave properly and you'll
soon be downstairs again.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
picked at her dinner. She did not feel at all hungry. She lay back on the bed,
thinking of Tim and thinking of the eight panels over the mantelpiece. Could
they possibly be the ones shown in the Secret Way directions? She gazed out of
the window and thought hard.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Golly,
it's snowing!' she said suddenly, sitting up. T thought it would when I saw
that leaden sky this morning. It's snowing hard! It will be quite thick by
tonight - inches deep. Oh, poor Timothy. I hope Julian will see that his kennel
is kept clear of the drifting snow.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
had plenty of time to think as she lay in bed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Joanna
came and took the tray away. No one else came to see her. George felt sure the
other children had been forbidden to go up and speak to her. She felt lonely
and left-out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
thought of her father's lost pages. Could Mr. Roland have taken them? After
all, he was very interested in her father's work and seemed to understand it.
The thief must have been someone who knew which were the important pages.
Surely Timothy would have barked if a thief had come in from outside, even
though the study was the other side of the house. Timmy had such sharp ears.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
think it must have been someone mside the house,' said George. 'None of us
children, that's certain - and not Mother or Joanna. So that only leaves Mr.
Roland. And I did find him in the study that other night when Timmy woke me by
growling.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
sat up in bed suddenly. 'I believe Mr. Roland had Timothy put out of the house
because he wanted to go poking round the study again and was afraid Tim would
bark!' she thought. 'He was so very insistent that Tim should go out of doors -
even when everyone else begged for me to have him indoors. I believe -1 really
do believe - that Mr. Roland is the thief!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
little girl felt very excited. Could it be that the tutor had stolen the pages
- and broken those important test-tubes? How she wished that the others would
come and see her, so that she could talk things over with them!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Thirteen<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>JULIAN
HAS A SURPRISE<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>THE
three children downstairs felt very sorry for George. Uncle Quentin had
forbidden them to go up and see her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'A
little time for thinking out things all alone may do George good,' he said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Poor
old George,' said Julian. 'It's too bad, isn't it? I say - look at the snow!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
snow was falling very thickly. Julian went to the window and looked out. 'I
shall have to go and see that Timmy's kennel is all right,' he said. 'We don't
want the poor old fellow to be snowed up! I expect he is wondering what the
snow is!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timothy
was certainly very puzzled to see everywhere covered with soft white stuff. He
sat in his kennel and stared out at the falling flakes, his big brown eyes
following them as they fell to the ground. He was puzzled and unhappy. Why was
he living out here by himself in the cold? Why didn't George come to him?
Didn't she love him any more? The big dog was very miserable, as miserable as
George!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
was delighted to see Julian. He jumped up at the boy and licked his face. 'Good
old Tim!' said Julian. 'Are you all right? Let me sweep away some of this snow
and swing your kennel round a bit so that no flakes fly inside. There - that's
better. No, we're not going for a walk, old thing - not now.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boy patted the dog and fussed him a bit, then went indoors. The others met him
at the sitting-room door.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Julian!
Mr. Roland is going out for a walk by himself. Aunt Fanny is lying down, and
Uncle Quentin is in his study. Can't we go up and see George ?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'We
were forbidden to,' said Julian, doubtfully.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>T
know,' said Dick. 'But I don't mind risking it for the sake of making George
feel a bit happier. It must be so awful for her, lying up there all alone,
knowing she can't see Tim for days.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well
- let me go up, as I'm the eldest,' said Julian. 'You two stay down here in the
sitting-room and talk. Then Uncle Quentin will think we're all here. I'll slip
up and see George for a few minutes.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'All
right,' said Dick. 'Give her our love and tell her we'll look after Timmy.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
slipped quietly up the stairs. He opened George's door and crept inside. He
shut the door, and saw George sitting up in bed, looking at him in delight.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Sh!'
said Julian. 'I'm not supposed to be here!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh
Julian!' said George joyfully. 'How good of you to come. I was so lonely. Come
this side of the bed. Then if anyone comes in suddenly, you can duck down and
hide.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
went to the other side of the bed. George began to pour out to him all she had
been thinking of.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
believe Mr. Roland is the thief, I really do!' she said. 'I'm not saying that
because I hate him, Julian, really I'm not. After all, I did find him snooping
round the study one afternoon - and again in the middle of the night. He may
have got to hear of my father's work, and come to see if he could steal it. It
was just lucky for him that we needed a tutor. I'm sure he stole those pages,
and I'm sure he wanted Timmy out of the house so that he could do his stealing
without Tim hearing him and growling.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh,
George - I don't think so,' said Julian, who really could not approve of the
idea of the tutor doing such a thing. 'It all sounds so far-fetched and
unbelievable.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Lot's
of unbelievable things happen,' said George. 'Lots. And this is one of them.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,
if Mr. Roland did steal the pages, they must be somewhere in the house,' said
Julian. 'He hasn't been out all day. They must be somewhere in his bedroom.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Of
course!' said George, looking thrilled. T wish he'd go out! Then I'd search his
room.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'George,
you can't do things like that,' said Julian, quite shocked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'You
simply don't know what things I can do, if I really want to,' said George,
setting her mouth in a firm line. 'Oh - what's that noise ?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was the bang of a door. Julian went cautiously to the window and peeped out.
The snow had stopped falling for a time, and Mr. Roland had taken the chance of
going out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'It's
Mr. Roland,' said Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oooh
- I could search his room now, if you'll keep watch at the window and tell me
if he comes back,' said George, throwing back the bedclothes at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'No,
George, don't,' said Julian. 'Honestly and truly, it's awful to search
somebody's room like that. And<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>anyway,
I dare say he's got the pages with him. He may even be going to give them to
somebody!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
never thought of that,' said George, and she looked at Julian with wide eyes.
'Isn't that sickening ? Of course he may be doing that. He knows those two
artists at Kirrin Farm-house, for instance. They may be in the plot too.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh,
George, don't be silly,' said Julian. 'You are making a mountain out of a
mole-hill, talking of plots and goodness knows what! Anyone would think we were
in the middle of a big adventure.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,
I think we are,' said George, unexpectedly, and she looked rather solemn. 'I
sort of feel it all round me -a Big Adventure!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
stared at his cousin thoughtfully. Could there possibly be anything in what she
said ?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Julian,
will you do something for me?' said George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Of
course,' said the boy, at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Go
out and follow Mr. Roland,' said George. 'Don't let him see you. There's a
white mackintosh cloak in the hall cupboard. Put it on and you won't be easily
seen against the snow. Follow him and see if he meets anyone and gives them
anything that looks like the pages of my father's book - you know those big
pages he writes on. They're very large.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'All
right,' said Julian. 'But if I do, promise you won't go and search his room.
You can't do things like that, George.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
can,' said George. 'But I won't, if you'll just follow Mr. Roland for me. I'm
sure he's going to hand over what he has stolen to others who are in the plot!
And<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
bet those others will be the two artists at Kirrin Farmhouse that he pretended
not to know!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'You'll
find you're quite wrong,' said Julian, going to the door. 'I'm sure I shan't be
able to follow Mr. Roland, anyway - he's been gone five minutes now!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Yes,
you will, silly - he'll have left his footmarks in the snow,' said George. 'And
oh, Julian - I quite forgot ta tell you something else exciting. Oh dear, there
isn't time now. I'll tell you when you come back, if you can come up again
then. It's about the Secret Way.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Really?'
said Julian, in delight. It had been a great disappointment to him that all
their hunting and searching had come to nothing. 'All right - I'll try and
creep up again later. If I don't come, you'll know I can't, and you must wait
till bed-time.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
disappeared and shut the door quietly. He slipped downstairs, popped his head
into the sitting-room and whispered to the others that he was going out after
the tutor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Tell
you why, later,' he said. He put the white mac-«-kintosh cloak around him and
went out into the garden. Snow was beginning to fall again, but not yet heavily
enough to hide Mr. Roland's deep footsteps. He had had big Wellington boots on,
and the footmarks showed up well in the six-inch-deep snow.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boy followed them quickly. The countryside was | very wintry-looking now. The
sky was low and leaden, and he could see there was much more snow to come. He
hurried on after Mr. Roland, though he could not see ; a sign of the tutor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Down
the lane, and over the path that led across<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the
common went the double row of footmarks. Julian stumbled on, his eyes glued to
the foot-prints. Suddenly he heard the sound of voices and stopped. A big gorse
bush lay to the right and the voices came from there. The boy went nearer to
the bush. He heard his tutor's voice, talking in low tones. He could not hear a
word that was said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Whoever
can he be talking to?' he wondered. He crept up closer to the bush. There was a
hollow space inside. Julian thought he could creep right into it, though it
would be very prickly, and peer out of the other side. Carefully the boy crept
into the prickly hollow, where the branches were bare and brown.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
parted the prickly branches slowly and cautiously -and to his amazement he saw
Mr. Roland talking to the two artists from Kirrin Farm-house - Mr. Thomas and
Mr. Wilton! So George was right. The tutor had met them - and, as Julian
watched, Mr. Roland handed over to Mr. Thomas a doubled up sheaf of papers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'They
look just like pages from Uncle Quentin's book,' said Julian to himself. 'I say
- this is mighty queer. It does begin to look like a plot - with Mr. Roland as
the centre of it!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr.
Thomas put the papers into the pocket of his overcoat. The men muttered a few
more words, which even Julian's sharp ears could not catch, and then parted.
The artists went off towards Kirrin Farm-house, and Mr. Roland took the path
back over the common. Julian crouched down in the hollow of the prickly gorse
bush, hoping the tutor would not turn and see him. Luckily he didn't. He went
straight on and disappeared into<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the
snow, which was now falling thickly. It was also beginning to get dark and
Julian, unable to see the path very clearly, hurried after Mr. Roland,
half-afraid of being lost in the snow-storm.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr.
Roland was not anxious to be out longer than he could help, either. He almost
ran back to Kirrin Cottage. He came to the gate at last, and Julian watched him
go into the house. He gave him a little time to take off his things and then,
giving Timothy a pat as he went by, he went to the garden door. He took off his
mackintosh cloak, changed his boots, and slipped into the sitting-room before
Mr. Roland had come down from his bedroom.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'What's
happened?' asked Dick and Anne, seeing that Julian was in a great state of
excitement. But he could not tell them, for at that moment Joanna came in to
lay the tea.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Much
to Julian's disappointment, he could not say a word to the others all that
evening, because one or other of the grown-ups was always in the room. Neither
could he go up to see George. He could hardly wait to tell his news, but it was
no good, he had to.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Is
it still snowing, Aunt Fanny ?' asked Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Her
aunt went to the front door and looked out. The snow was piled high against the
step!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Yes,'
she said, when she came back. 'It is snowing fast and thickly. If it goes on
like this we shall be completely snowed up, as we were two winters ago! We
couldn't get out of the house for five days then. The milkman couldn't get to
us, nor the baker. Fortunately we had plenty of tinned milk, and I can bake
my-own<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>bread.
Poor children - you will not be able to go out tomorrow - the snow will be too
thick!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Will
Kirrin Farm-house be snowed up too?' asked Mr. Roland.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh
yes - worse than we shall be,' said Aunt Fanny. 'But they won't mind! They have
plenty of food there. They will be prisoners just as much, and more, as we
shall.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
wondered why Mr. Roland had asked that question. Was he afraid that his friends
would not be able to send those pages away by the post - or take them anywhere
by bus or car? The boy felt certain this was the reason for the question. How
he longed to be able to talk over everything with the others.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I'm
tired!' he said, about eight o'clock. 'Let's go to bed.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
and Anne stared at him in astonishment. Usually, as he was the eldest, he went
to bed last of all. Tonight he was actually asking to go! Julian winked quickly
at them, and they backed him up at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
yawned widely, and so did Anne. Their aunt put down the sewing she was doing.
'You do sound tired!' she said. 'I think you'd better all go to bed.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Could
I just go out and see if Timmy is all right?' I asked Julian. His aunt nodded.
The boy put on his rubber boots and coat, and slipped out through the garden
door into the yard. It was very deep in snow, too. Tim's kennel was half-hidden
in it. The dog had trampled a | space in front of the kennel door, and stood
there, looking for Julian as he came out of the house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Poor
old boy, out here in the snow all alone,' said<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian.
He patted the dog, and Timmy whined. He was asking to go back with the boy.<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>  </span>*<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
wish I could take you back with me,' said Julian. 'Never mind, Timothy. I'll
come and see you tomorrow.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
went indoors again. The children said good night to their aunt and Mr. Roland,
and went upstairs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Undress
quickly, put on dressing-gowns and meet in George's room,' whispered Julian to
the others. 'Don't make a sound or we'll have Aunt Fanny up. Quick now!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
less than three minutes the children were undressed, and were sitting on
George's bed. She was very pleased to see them. Anne slipped into bed with her,
because her feet were cold.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Julian!
Did you follow Mr. Roland all right?' whispered George.<span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>            </span>*<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Why
did he follow him ?' asked Dick, who had been dying to know.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
told them everything as quickly as he could -all that George suspected - and
how he had followed the tutor - and what he had seen. When George heard how
Julian had watched him giving a sheaf of papers to the two artists, her eyes
gleamed angrily.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'The
thief! They must have been the lost pages! And to think my father has been so
friendly to him. Oh, what can we do? Those men will get the papers away as
quickly as they can, and the secret Father has been working on for ages will be
used by someone else - for some other country, probably!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'They
can't get the papers away,' said Julian. 'You've no idea how thick the snow is
now, George. We shall<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>be
prisoners here for a few days, if this snow goes on, and so will the people in
Kirrin Farm-house. If they want to hide the papers, they will have to hide them
in the farmhouse! If only we could get over there and hunt round!'<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>     </span>&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,
we can't,' said Dick. 'That's quite certain. We'd be up to our necks in snow!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
four children looked gloomily at one another. Dick and Anne could hardly
believe that the jolly Mr. Roland was a thief - a spy perhaps, trying to steal
a valuable secret from a friendly scientist. And they couldn't stop it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'We'd
better tell your father,' said Julian at last.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'No,'
said Anne. 'He wouldn't believe it, would he, George ?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'He'd
laugh at us and go straight and tell Mr. Roland,' said George. 'That would warn
him, and he mustn't be warned. He mustn't know that we guess anything.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Sh!
Aunt Fanny's coming!' whispered Dick, suddenly. The boys slipped out of the
room and into bed. Anne hopped across to her own little bed. All was peace and
quiet when the children's aunt came into the bedroom.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
said good night and tucked them up. As soon as she had gone down, the four
children met together again in George's room.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'George,
tell me now what you were going to say about the Secret Way,' said Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh
yes,' said George. 'Well, there may be nothing in my idea at all - but in the
study downstairs, there are eight wooden panels over the mantelpiece - and the
floor<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>is
of stone - and the room faces east! A bit queer, isn't it ? Just what the
directions said.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Is
there a cupboard there too ?' asked Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'No.
But there is everything else,' said George. 'And I was just wondering if by any
chance the entrance to the Secret Way is in this house, not in the farm-house.
After all, they both belonged to my family at one time, you know. The people
living in the farm-house years ago must have known all about this cottage.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Golly,
George - suppose the entrance was here!' said Dick. 'Wouldn't it be simply
marvellous! Let's go straight down and look!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Don't
be silly,' said Julian. 'Go down to the study when Uncle Quentin is there? I'd
rather meet twenty lions than face Uncle! Especially after what has happened!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,
we simply MUST find out if George's idea is right; we simply must,' said Dick,
forgetting to whisper.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Shut
up, idiot!' said Julian, giving him a punch. 'Do you want to bring the whole household
up here ?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Sorry!'
said Dick. 'But, oh golly, this is exciting. It's an Adventure again.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Just
what I said,' said George, eagerly. 'Listen, shall we wait till midnight, and
then creep down to the study when everyone is asleep, and try our luck ? There
may be nothing in my idea at all - but we'll have to find out now. I don't
believe I could go to sleep till I've tried one of those panels over the
mantelpiece to see if something happens.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,
I know I can't sleep a wink either,' said Dick. 'Listen - is that someone
coming up? We'd better go.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Come
on, Julian! Meet in George's room at midnight - and we'll creep down and try
out George's idea!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
two boys went off to their own room. Neither of them could sleep a wink. Nor
could George. She lay awake, and went over and over in her mind all that had
happened those holidays. 'It's like a jigsaw puzzle,' she thought. 'I couldn't
understand a lot of things at first -but now they are fitting together, and
making a picture.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
was fast asleep. She had to be awakened at midnight. 'Come on!' whispered
Julian, shaking her. 'Don't you want to share in this adventure ?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chapter
Fourteen<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>THE
SECRET WAY AT LAST!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>THE
four children crept downstairs through the dark and silent night. Nobody made a
sound at all. They made their way to the study. George softly closed the door
and then switched on the light.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children stared at the eight panels over the mantelpiece. Yes - there were
exactly eight, four in one row and four in the row above. Julian spread the
linen roll out on the table, and the children pored over it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'The
cross is in the middle of the second panel in the top row,' said Julian, in a
low voice. Til try pressing it. Watch, all of you!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
went to the fireplace. The others followed him, their hearts beating fast with
excitement. Julian stood on tiptoe and began to press hard in the middle of the
second panel. Nothing happened.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Press
harder! Tap it!'said Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
daren't make too much noise,' said Julian, feeling all over the panel to see if
there was any roughness that might tell of a hidden spring or lever.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Suddenly,
under his hands, the panel slid silently back, just as the one had done at
Kirrin Farm-house in the hall! The children stared at the space behind,
thrilled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'It's
not big enough to get into,' said George. 'It can't be the entrance to the
Secret Way.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
got out his torch from his dressing-gown pocket. 146<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
put it inside the opening, and gave a low exclamation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'There's
a sort of handle here - with strong wire or something attached to it. I'll pull
it and see what happens.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
pulled - but he was not strong enough to move the handle that seemed to be
embedded in the wall. Dick put his hand in and the two boys then pulled
together.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'It's
moving - it's giving way a bit,' panted Julian. 'Go on, Dick, pull hard!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
handle suddenly came away from the wall, and behind it came thick wire, rusty
and old. At the same time a curious grating noise came from below the hearthrug
in front of the fireplace, and Anne almost fell.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Julian!
Something is moving under the rug!' she said, frightened. 'I felt it. Under the
rug, quick!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
handle could not be pulled out any farther. The boys let go, and looked down.
To the right of the fireplace, under the rug, something had moved. There was no
doubt of that. The rug sagged down instead of being flat and straight.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'A
stone has moved in the floor,' said Julian, his voice shaking with excitement.
'This handle works a lever, which is attached to this wire. Quick - pull up the
rug, and roll back the carpet.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>With
trembling hands the children pulled back the rug and the carpet — and then
stood staring at a very strange thing. A big flat stone laid in the floor had
slipped downwards, pulled in some manner by the wire attached to the handle
hidden behind the panel! There was now a black space where the stone had been.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Look
at that!' said George, in a thrilling whisper. 'The entrance to the Secret
Way!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'It's
here after all!' said Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Let's
go down!' said Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'No!'
said Anne, shivering at the thought of disappearing into the black hole.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
flashed his torch into the black space. The stone had slid down and then
sideways. Below was a space just big enough to take a man, bending down.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
expect there's a passage or something leading from here, under the house, and
out,' said Julian. 'Golly, I wonder where it leads to ?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'We
simply must find out,' said George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Not
now,' said Dick. 'It's dark and cold. I don't fancy going along the Secret Way
at midnight. I don't mind just hopping down to see what it's like - but don't
let's go along any passage till tomorrow.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Uncle
Quentin will be working here tomorrow,' said Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'He
said he was going to sweep the snow away from the front door in the morning,'
said George. 'We could slip into the study then. It's Saturday. There may be no
lessons.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'All
right,' said Julian, who badly wanted to explore everything then and there.
'But for goodness sake let's have a look and see if there is a passage down
there. At present all we can see is a hole!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Til
help you down,' said Dick. So he gave his brother a hand and the boy dropped
lightly down into the black space, holding his torch. He gave a loud
exclamation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'It's
the entrance to the Secret Way all right! There's<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>a
passage leading from here under the house - awfully low and narrow — but I can
see it's a passage. I do wonder where it leads to!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
shivered. It was cold and damp down there. 'Give me a hand up, Dirk,' he said.
He was soon out of the hole and in the warm study again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children looked at one another in the greatest joy and excitement. This was an
Adventure, a real Adventure. It was a pity they couldn't go on with it now.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'We'll
try and take Timmy with us tomorrow,' said George. 'Oh, I say - how are we
going to shut the entrance up ?)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'We
can't leave the rug and carpet sagging over that hole,' said Dick. 'Noi can we
leave the panel vopen.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'We'll
see if we can get the stone back,' said Julian. He stood on tiptoe and felt
about inside the panel. His hand closed on a kind of knob, set deep in a stone.
He pulled it, and at once the handle slid back, pulled by the wire. At the same
time the sunk stone glided to the surface of the floor again, making a slight
grating sound as it did so.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,
it's like magic!' said Dick. 'It really is! Fancy the mechanism working so smoothly
after years of not being used. This is the most exciting thing I've evei seen!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was a noise in the bedroom above. The children stood still and listened.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'It's
Mr. Roland!' whispered Dick. 'He's heard us. Quick, slip upstairs before he
comes down.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
switched out the light and opened the study door softly. Up the stairs they
fled, as quietly as Indians, their hearts thumping so loudly that it seemed as
if everyone in the house must hear the beat.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
girls got safely to their rooms and Dick was able to slip into his. But Julian
was seen by Mr. Roland as he came out of his room with a torch.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'What
are you doing, Julian?' asked the tutor, in surprise. 'Did you hear a noise
downstairs? I thought I did.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Yes
- I heard quite a lot of noise downstairs,' said Julian, truthfully. 'But
perhaps it's snow falling off the roof, landing with a plop on the ground, sir.
Do you think that's it?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
don't know,' said the tutor doubtfully. 'We'll go down and see.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went down, but of course, there was nothing to be seen. Julian was glad they
had been able to shut the panel and make the stone come back to its proper
place again. Mr. Roland was the very last person he wanted to tell his secret
to.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went upstairs and Julian slipped into his room. 'Is it all right ?' whispered
Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Yes,'
said Julian. 'Don't let's talk. Mr. Roland's awake, and I don't want him to
suspect anything.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boys fell asleep. When they awoke in the morning, there was a completely white
world outside. Snow covered everything and covered it deeply. Timothy's kennel
could not be seen! But there were footmarks round about it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
gave a squeal when she saw how deep the<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>snow
was. 'Poor Timothy! I'm going to get him in. I don't care what anyone says! I
won't let him be buried in the snow!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
dressed and tore downstairs. She went out to the kennel, floundering knee deep
in the snow. But there was no Timmy there!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
loud bark from the kitchen made her jump. Joanna the cook knocked on the
kitchen window. 'It's all right! I couldn't bear the dog out there in the snow,
so I fetched him in, poor thing. Your mother says I can have him in the kitchen
but you're not to come and see him.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh,
good - Timmy's in the warmth!' said George, gladly. She yelled to Joanna,
'Thanks awfully! You are kind!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
went indoors and told the others. They were very glad. 'And I've got a bit of
news for you' said Dick. 'Mr. Roland is in bed with a bad cold, so there are to
be no lessons today. Cheers!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Golly,
that is good news,' said George, cheering up tremendously. 'Timmy in the warm
kitchen and Mr. Roland kept in bed. I do feel pleased!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'We
shall be able to explore the Secret Way safely now,' said Julian. 'Aunt Fanny
is going to do something in the kitchen this morning with Joanna, and Uncle is
going to tackle the snow. I vote we say we'll do lessons by ourselves in the
sitting-room, and then, when everything is safe, we'll explore the Secret Way!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'But
why must we do lessons?' asked George in dismay.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Because
if we don't, silly, we'll have to help your father dig away the snow,' said
Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So,
to his uncle's surprise, Julian suggested that the four children should do
lessons by themselves in the sitting-room. 'Well, I thought you'd like to come
and help dig away the snow,' said Uncle Quentin. 'But perhaps you had better
get on with your work.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children sat themselves down as good as gold in the sitting-room, their books
before them. They heard Mr. Roland coughing in his room. They heard their aunt
go into the kitchen and talk to Joanna. They heard Timmy scratching at the
kitchen door - then paws pattering down the passage - then a big, inquiring
nose came round the door, and there was old Timmy, looking anxiously for his
beloved mistress!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Timmy!'
squealed George, and ran to him. She flung her arms round his neck and hugged
him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'You
act as if you hadn't seen Tim for a year,' said Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'It
seems like a year,' said George. 'I say, there's my father digging away like
mad. Can't we go to the study now ? We ought to be safe for a good while.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
left the sitting-room and went to the study. Julian was soon pulling the handle
behind the secret panel. George had already turned back the rug and the carpet.
The stone slid downward and sideways. The Secret Way was open!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Come
on!' said Julian. 'Hurry!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
jumped down itito the hole. Dick followed, then Anne, then George. Julian
pushed them all into the narrow, low passage. Then he looked up. Perhaps he had
better pull the carpet and rug over the hole, in case anyone came into the room
and looked around. It took<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>him
a few seconds to do it. Then he bent down and joined the others in the passage.
They were going to explore the Secret Way at last!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chapter
Fifteen<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>AN
EXCITING JOURNEY AND HUNT<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>TIMOTHY
had leapt down into the hole when George had jumped. He now ran ahead of the
children, puzzled at their wanting to explore such a cold, dark place. Both
Julian and Dick had torches, which threw broad beams before them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was not much to be seen. The Secret Way under the old house was narrow and low,
so that the children were forced to go in single file, and to stoop almost
double. It was a great relief to them when the passage became a little wider,
and the room a little higher. It was very tiring to stoop all the time.<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>          </span>v<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Have
you any idea where the Secret Way is going?' Dick asked Julian. 'I mean - is it
going towards the sea, or away from it ?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh,
not towards the sea!' said Julian, who had a very good sense of direction. 'As
far as I can make out the passage is going towards the common. Look at the
walls - they are rather sandy in places, and we know the common has sandy soil.
I hope we shan't find that the passage has fallen in anywhere.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went on and on. The Secret Way was very straight, though occasionally it wound
round a rocky part in a curve.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Isn't
it dark and cold,' said Anne, shivering. 'I wish I had put on a coat. How many
miles have we come, Julian ?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Not
even one, silly!' said Julian. 'Hallo - look here -the passage has fallen in a
bit thei e!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Two
bright torches shone in front of them and the children saw that the sandy roof
had fallen in. Julian kicked at the pile of sandy soil with his foot.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'It's
all right,' he said. 'We can force our way through easily. It isn't much of a
fall, and it's mostly sand. I'll do a bit of kicking!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>After
some trampling and kicking, the roof-fall no longer blocked the way. There was
now enough room for the children to climb over it, bending their heads low to
avoid knocking them against the top of the passage. Julian shone his torch
forward, and saw that the way was clear.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'The
Secret Way is very wide just here!' he said suddenly, and flashed his torch
around to show the others.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'It's
been widened out to make a sort of little room,' said George. 'Look, there's a
kind of bench at the back, made out of the rock. I believe it's a
resting-place.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
was right. It was very tiring to creep along the narrow passage for so long.
The little wide place with its rocky bench, made a very good resting-place. The
four tired children, cold but excited, huddled together on the queer seat and
took a welcome rest. Timmy put his head on George's knee. He was delighted to
be with her again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,
come on,' said Julian, after a few minutes. 'I'm getting awfully cold. I do
wonder where this passage comes out!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Julian
- do you think it could come out at Kirrin Farm-house?' asked George, suddenly.
'You know what Mrs. Sanders said - that there was a secret passage leading from
the Farm-house somewhere. Well, this may be the one - and it leads to Kirrin
Cottage!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'George,
I believe you're right!' said Julian. 'Yes -the two houses belonged to your
family years ago! And in the old days there were often secret passages joining
houses, so it's quite plain this secret way joins them up together! Why didn't
I think of that before ?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>1
say!' squealed Anne, in a high, excited voice, 'I say! I've thought of
something too!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'What
?' asked everyone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well
- if those two artists have got Uncle's papers, we may be able to get them away
before the men can send them off by post, or take them away themselves!' squeaked
Anne, so thrilled with her idea that she could hardly get the words out quickly
enough. 'They're prisoners at the Farm-house because of the snow, just as we
were at the Cottage.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Anne!
You're right!' said Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Clever
girl!' said Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
say - if we could get those papers again - how wonderful it would be!' cried
George. Timmy joined in the general excitement, and jumped up and down in joy.
Something had pleased the children, so he was pleased too!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Come
on!' said Julian, taking Anne's hand. 'This is thrilling. If George is right,
and this Secret Way comes out at Kirrin Farm-house somewhere, we'll somehow
hunt through those men's rooms and find the papers.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'You
said that searching people's rooms was a shocking thing to do,' said George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,
I didn't know then all I know now,' said Julian. 'We're doing this for your
father - and maybe for our country too, if his secret formula is valuable.
We've got to set our wits to work now, to outwit dangerous enemies.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Do
you really think they are dangerous ?' asked Anne, rather afraid.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Yes,
I should think so,' said Julian. 'But you needn't worry, Anne, You've got me
and Dick and Tim to protect you.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
can protect her too,' said George, indignantly. Tm as good as a boy any day!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Yes,
you are, really,' said Dick. 'In fact, you're fiercer than any boy I know!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Come
on,' said Julian, impatiently. Tm longing to get to the end of this passage.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all went on again, Anne following behind Julian, and Dick behind George. Timmy
ran up and down the line, squeezing by them whenever he wanted to. He thought
it was a very peculiar way to spend a morning!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
stopped suddenly, after they had gone a good way. 'What's up?' asked Dick, from
the back. 'Not another roof-fall, I hope!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'No
- but I think we've come to the end of the passage!' said Julian, thrilled. The
others crowded as close to him as they could. The passage certainly had come to
an end. There was a rocky wall in front of them, and set firmly in it were iron
staples intended for footholds. These went up the wall and when Julian turned
his torch<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>upwards,
the children saw that there was a square opening in the roof of the passage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'We
have to climb up this rocky wall now,' said Julian, 'go through that dark hole
there, keep on climbing - and goodness knows where we come out! I'll go first.
You wait here, everyone, and I'll come back and tell you what I've seen.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boy put his torch befween his teeth, and then pulled himself up by the iron
staples set in the wall. He set his feet on them, and then climbed up through
the square dark hole, feeling for the staples as he went.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
went up for a good way. It was almost like going up a chimney shaft, he
thought. It was cold and smelt musty.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Suddenly
he came to a ledge, and he stepped on to it. He took his torch from his teeth
and flashed it around him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was stone wall behind him, at the side of him and stone above him. The black
hole up which he had come, yawned by his feet. Julian shone his torch in front
of him, and a shock of surprise went through him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was no stone wall in front of him, but a big wooden, door, made of black oak. A
handle was set about waist-high, Julian turned it with trembling fingers. What
was he going to see ?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
door opened outwards, over the ledge, and it was difficult to get round it
without falling back into the hole. Julian managed to open it wide, squeezed
round it without losing his footing, and stepped beyond it, expecting to find
himself in a room.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
his hand felt more wood in front of him! He<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>shone
his torch round, and found that he was up against what looked like yet another
door. Under his searching fingers it suddenly moved sideways, and slid silently
away!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
then Julian knew where he was! 'I'm in the cupboard at Kirrin Farm-house - the
one that has a false back!' he thought. 'The Secret Way comes up behind it! How
clever! Little did we* know when we played about in this cupboard that not only
did it have a sliding back, but that it was the entrance to the Secret Way,
hidden behind it!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
cupboard was now full of clothes belonging to the artists. Julian stood and
listened. There was no sound of anyone in the room. Should he just take a quick
look round, and see if those lost papers were anywhere about ?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then
he remembered the other four, waiting patiently below in the cold. He had
better go and tell them what had happened. They could all come and help in the
search.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
stepped into the space behind the sliding back. The sliding door slipped across
again, and Julian was left standing on the narrow ledge, with the old oak door
wide open to one side of him. He did not bother to shut it. He felt about with
his feet, and found the iron staples in the hole below him. Down he went,
clinging with his hands and feet, his torch in his teeth again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Julian!
What a time you've been! Quick, tell us all about it!' cried George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'It's
most terribly thrilling,' said Julian. 'Absolutely super! Where do you suppose
all this leads to? Into the<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>cupboard
at Kirrin Farm-house - the one that's got a false back!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Golly!
'said Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
say I' said George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Did
you go into the room ?' cried Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
climbed as far as I could and came to a big oak door,' said Julian. 'It has a
handle this side, so I swung it wide open. Then I saw another wooden door in
front of me - at least, I thought it was a door,' I didn't know it was just the
false back of that cupboard. It was quite easy to slide back and I stepped
through, and found my-self among a whole lot of clothes hanging in the
cup-board ! Then I hurried back to tell you.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Julian!
We can hunt for those papers now,' said George, eagerly. 'Was there anyone in
the room ?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
couldn't hear anyone,' said Julian. 'Now what I propose is this - we'll all go
up, and have a hunt round those two rooms. The men have the room next to the
cupboard one too.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh
good ! ' said Dick, thrilled at the thought of such an adventure. 'Let's go
now. You go first, Ju. Then Anne, then George and then me.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'What
about Tim ?' asked George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'He
can't climb, silly,' said Julian. 'He's a simply marvellous dog, but he
certainly can't climb, George. We'll hav&lt;? to leave him down here.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'He
won't like that,' said George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,
we can't carry him up,' said Dick. 'You won't , mind staying here for a bit,
will you, Tim, old fel-<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Tim
wagged his tail. But, as he saw the four children<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>mysteriously
disappearing up the wall, he put his big tail down at once. What! Going without
him? How could they ?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
jumped up at the wall, and fell back. He jumped again and whined. George called
down to him in a low voice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Be
quiet, Tim dear! We shan't be long.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Tim
stopped whining. He lay down at the bottom of the wall, his ears well-cocked.
This adventure was becoming more and more peculiar!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Soon
the children were on the narrow ledge. The old oak door was still wide open.
Julian shone his torch and the others saw the false back of the cupboard.
Julian put his hands on it and it slid silently sideways. Then the torch shone
on coats and dressing-gowns!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children stood quite still, listening. There was no sound from the room. Til
open the cupboard door and peep into the room,' whispered Julian. 'Don't make a
sound!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boy pushed between the clothes and felt for the outer cupboard door with his
hand. He found it, and pushed it slightly. It opened a little and a shaft of
daylight came into the cupboard. He peeped cautiously into the room.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was no one there at all. That was good. 'Come on!' he whispered to the others.
'The room's empty P<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>One
by one the children crept out of the clothes cupboard and into the room. There
was a big bed there, a wash-stand, chest of drawers, small table and two
chairs. Nothing else. It would be easy to search the whole room.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Look,
Julian, there's a door between the two rooms,'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>said
George, suddenly. 'Two of us can go and hunt there and two here — and we can
lock the doors that lead on to the landing, so that no one can come in and
catch us!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Good
idea!' said Julian, who was afraid that at any moment someone might come in and
catch them in their search. 'Anne and I will go into the next room, and you and
Dick can search this one. Lock the door that opens on to the landing, Dick, and
I'll lock the one in the other room. We'll leave the connecting-door open, so
that we can whisper to one another.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Quietly
the boy slipped through the connecting-door into the second room, which was very
like the first. That was empty too. Julian went over to the door that led to
the landing, and turned the key in the lock. He heard Dick doing the same to
the door in the other room. He heaved a big sigh. Now he felt safe!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Anne,
turn up the rugs and see if any papers are hidden there,' he said. 'Then look
under the chair-cushions and strip the bed to see if anything is hidden under
the mattress.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
set to work, and Julian began to hunt too. He started on the chest of drawers,
which he thought would be a very likely place to hide things in. The children's
hands were shaking, as they felt here and there for the lost papers. It was so
terribly exciting.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
wondered where the two men were. Down in the warm kitchen, perhaps. It was cold
up here in the bedrooms, and they would not want to be away from the warmth.
They could not go out because the snow was piled in great drifts round Kirrin
Farm-house!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
and George were searching hard in the other<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>room.
They looked in every drawer. They stripped the bed. They turned up rugs and
carpet. They even put their hands up the big chimney-place!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Julian?
Have you found anything?' asked Dick in a low voice, appearing at the door
between the two rooms.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Not
a thing,' said Julian, rather gloomily. They've hidden the papers well! I only
hope they haven't got them on them - in their pockets, or something!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
stared at him in dismay. He hadn't thought of that. 'That would be sickening!'
he said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'You
go back and hunt everywhere - simply everywhere I' ordered Julian. 'Punch the
pillows to see if they've stuck them under the pillow-case!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
disappeared. Rather a lot of noise came from his room. It sounded as if he were
doing a good deal of punching!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
and Julian went on hunting too. There was simply nowhere that they did not
look. They even turned the pictures round to see if the papers had been stuck
behind one of them. But there was nothing to be found. It was bitterly
disappointing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'We
can't go without finding them,' said Julian, in desperation. 'It was such a bit
of luck to get here like this, down the Secret Way - right into the bedrooms!
We simply must find those papers!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
say,' said Dick, appearing again, 'I can hear voices! Listen!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>All
four children listened. Yes - there were men's voices - just outside the
bedroom doors!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chapter
Sixteen<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>THE
CHILDREN ARE DISCOVERED<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'WHAT
shall we do?' whispered George. They had all tiptoed to the first room, and
were standing together, listening.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'We'd
better go down the Secret Way again,' said Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh
no, we ...' began George, when she heard the handle of the door being turned.
Whoever was trying to get in, could not open the door. There was an angry
exclamation, and then the children heard Mr. Wilton's voice. &quot;Thomas! My
door seems to have stuck. Do you mind if I come through your bedroom and see
what's the matter with this handle ?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Come
right along!' came the voice of Mr. Thomas. There was the sound of footsteps
going to the outer door of the second room. Then there was the noise of a
handle being turned and shaken.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'What's
this!' said Mr. Wilton, in exasperation. 'This won't open, either. Can the
doors be locked ?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'It
looks like it!' said Mr. Thomas.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was a pause. Then the children distinctly heard a few words uttered in a low
voice. 'Are the papers safe? Is anyone after them ?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'They're
in your room, aren't they ?' said Mr. Thomas. There was another pause. The
children looked at one another. So the men had got the papers - and what was
more, they were in the room! The very room the children stood in! They looked
round it eagerly, racking their brains to think of some place they had not yet
explored.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Quick!
Hunt round again whilst we've time/ whispered Julian. 'Don't make a noise.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>On
tiptoe the children began a thorough hunt once more. How they searched! They even
opened the pages of the books on the table, thinking that the papers might have
been slipped in there. But they could find nothing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Hie,
Mrs. Sanders!' came Mr. Wilton's voice. 'Have you by any chance locked these
two doors ? We can't get in!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Dear
me!' said the voice of Mrs. Sanders from the stairs. 'I'll come along and see.
I certainly haven't locked any doors!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Once
again the handles were turned, but the doors would not open. The men began to
get very impatient.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Do
you suppose anyone is in our rooms ?' Mr. Wilton asked Mrs. Sanders.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
laughed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well
now, sir, who would be in your rooms ? There's only me and Mr. Sanders in the
house, and you know as well as I do that no one can come in from outside, for
we're quite snowed up. I don't understand it - the locks of the doors must have
slipped.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
was lifting up the wash-stand jug to look underneath, at that moment. It was
heavier than she thought, and she had to let it down again suddenly. It struck
the<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>marble
wash-stand with a crash, and water slopped out all over the place!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
outside the door heard the noise. Mr. Wilton banged on the door and rattled the
handle.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Who's
there? Let us in or you'll be sorry! What are you doing in there ?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Idiot,
Anne!' said Dick. 'Now they'll break the door down!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>That
was exactly what the two men intended to do! Afraid that someone was
mysteriously in their room, trying to find the stolen papers, they went quite
mad, and began to put their shoulders to the door, and heave hard. The door
shook and creaked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Now
you be careful what you're doing!' cried the indignant voice of Mrs. Sanders.
The men took no notice. There came a crash as they both tried out their double
strength on the door.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Quick!
We must go!' said Julian. 'We mustn't let the men know how we got here, or we
shan't be able to come and hunt another time. Anne, George, Dick - get back to
the cupboard quickly!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children raced for the clothes cupboard. Til go first and help you down,' said
Julian. He got out on to the narrow ledge and found the iron foot-holds with
his feet. Down he went, torch held between his teeth as usual.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Anne,
come next,' he called, 'And Dick, you come third, and give a hand to Anne if
she wants it. George is a good climber - she can easily get down herself.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
was slow at climbing down. She was terribly excited, rather frightened, and so
afraid of falling that<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>she
hardly dared to feel for each iron staple as she went down.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Buck
up, Anne!' whispered Dick, above her. 'The men have almost got the door down!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
were tremendous sounds coming from the bedroom door. At any moment now it might
break down, and the men would come racing in. Dick was thankful when he could
begin to climb down the wall! Once they were all out, Georgfe could shut the
big oak door, and they would be safe.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
was hidden among the clothes in the cupboard, waiting her turn to climb down.
As she stood there, trying in vain to go over any likely hiding-place in her
mind, her hands felt something rustly in the pocket of a coat, she was standing
against. It was a mackintosh coat, with big pockets. The little girl's heart
gave a leap.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Suppose
the papers had been left in the pocket of the coat the man had on when he took
them from Mr. Roland? That was the only place the children had not searched -
the pockets of the coats in the cupboard! With trembling fingers the girl felt
in the pocket where the rustling was.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
drew out a sheaf of papers. It was dark in the cupboard, and she could not see
if they were the ones she was hunting for, or not - but how she hoped they
were! She stuffed them up the front of her jersey, for she had no big pocket,
and whispered to Dick:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Can
I come now?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>CRASH!
The door fell in with a terrific noise, and the two men leapt into the room.
They looked round. It was empty! But there was the water spilt on the wash-<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>stand
and on the floor. Someone must be there somewhere !<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Look
in the cupboard!' said Mr. Thomas.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
crept out of the clothes and on to the narrow ledge, beyond the place where the
false back of the cupboard used to be. It was still hidden sideways in the
wall. The girl climbed down the hole a few steps and then shut the oak door
which was now above her head. She had not enough strength to close it
completely, but she hoped that now she was safe!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
men went to the cupboard and felt about in the clothes for anyone who might
possibly be hiding there. Mr. Wilton gave a loud cry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'The
papers are gone! They were in this pocket! There's not a sign of them. Quick,
Thomas, we must find the thief and get them back!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
men did not notice that the cupboard seemed to go farther back than usual. They
stepped away from it now that they were sure no one was there, and began to
hunt round the room.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>By
now all the children except George were at the bottom of the hole, standing in
the Secret Way, waiting impatiently for George to come down. Poor George was in
such a hurry to get down that she caught her skirt or\ one of the staples, and
had to stand in a very dangerous position trying to disentangle it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Come
on, George, for goodness sake!' said Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timothy
jumped up at the wall. He could feel the fear and excitement of the waiting
children, and it upset him. He wanted George. Why didn't she come? Why was she
up that dark hole ? Tim was unhappy about her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
threw back his head and gave such a loud and mournful howl that all the
children jumped violently.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Shut
up, Tim!' said Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Tim
howled again, and the weird sound echoed round and about in a queer manner.
Anne was terrified, and she began to cry. Timothy howled again and again. Once
he began to howl it was difficult to stop him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
men in the bedroom above heard the extraordinary noise, and stopped in
amazement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Whatever's
that ?' said one.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Sounds
like a dog howling in the depths of the earth,5 said the other.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Tunny!'
said Mr. Wilton. 'It seems to be coming from the direction of that cupboard.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
went over to it and opened the door. Tim chose that moment to give a specially
mournful howl, and Mr. Wilton jumped. He got into the cupboard and felt about
at the back. The oak door there gave way beneath his hand, and he felt it open.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Thomas!
There's something queer here,' called Mr. Wilton. 'Bring my torch off the
table.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Tim
howled again and the noise made Mr. Wilton shiver! Tim had a peculiarly
horrible howl. It came echoing up the hole, and burst out into the cupboard.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr.
Thomas got the torch. The men shone it at the back of the cupboard, and gave an
exclamation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Look
at that! There's a door here! Where does it lead to?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mrs.
Sanders, who had been watching everything in surprise and indignation, angry
that her door should have been broken down, came up to the cupboard.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'My!'
she said. 'I knew there was a false back to that cupboard — but I didn't know
there was another door behind it too! That must be the entrance to the Secret
Way that people used in the old days.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Where
does it lead to ?' rapped out Mr. Wilton.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Goodness
knows!' said Mrs. Sanders. 'I never took much interest in such things.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Come
on, Thomas - we must go down,' said Mr. Wilton, shining his torch into the square
black hole, and seeing the iron foot-holds set in the stone. 'This is where the
thief went. He can't have got far. We'll go after him. We've got to get those
papers back!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was not long before the two men had swung themselves over the narrow ledge and
down into the hole, feeling with their feet for the iron staples. Down they
went and down, wondering where they were coming to. There was no sound below
them. Clearly the thief had got away!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
had got down at last. Tim almost knocked her over in his joy. She put her hand
on his head. 'You old silly!' she said. 'I believe you've given our secret
away! Quick, Ju — we must go, because those men will be after us in a minute.
They could easily hear Tim's howling!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
took Anne's hand. 'Come along, Anne,' he said. 'You must run as fast as you
can. Hurry now! Dick, keep with George.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
four of them hurried down the dark, narrow passage. What a long way they had to
go home! If only the passage wasn't such a long one! The children's hearts were
beating painfully as they made haste, stumbling as they went.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
shone his light steadily in front of him, and Dick shone his at the back.
Half-leading half-dragging Anne, Julian hurried along. Behind them they heard a
shout.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Look!
There's a light ahead! That's the thief! Come on, we'll soon get him!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chapter
Seventeen GOOD OLD TIM!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'HURRY,
Anne, do hurry!' shouted Dick, who was just behind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Poor
Anne was finding it very difficult to get along quickly. Pulled by Julian and
pushed by Dick, she almost fell two or three times. Her breath came in loud
pants, and she felt as if she would burst.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Let
rne have a rest!' she panted. But there was no time for that, with the two men
hurrying after them! They came to the piece that was widened out, where the
rocky bench was, and Anne looked longingly at it. But the boys hurried her on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Suddenly
the little girl caught her foot on a stone and fell heavily, almost dragging
Julian down with her. She tried to get up, and began to cry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I've
hurt my foot! I've twisted it! Oh, Julian, it hurts me to walk.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,
you've just got to come along, darling,' said Julian, sorry for his little
sister, but knowing that they would all be caught if he was not firm. 'Hurry as
much as you can.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
now it was impossible for Anne to go fast. She cried with pain as her foot hurt
her, and hobbled along so slowly that Dick almost fell over her. Dick cast a
look behind him and saw the light of the men's torches coming nearer and
nearer. Whatever were they to do?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I'll
stay here with Tim and keep them off,' said George, suddenly. 'Here, take these
papers, Dick! I believe they're the ones we want, but I'm not sure till we get
a good light to see them. I found them in a pocket of one of the coats in the
cupboard.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Golly!'
said Dick, surprised. He took the sheaf of papers and stuffed them up his
jersey, just as George had stuffed them up hers. They were too big to go into
his trousers pockets. 'I'll stay with you, George, and let the other two go on
ahead.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'No.
I want the papers taken to safety, in case they are my father's,' said George.
'Go on, Dick! I'll be all right here with Tim. I shall stay here just where the
passage curves round this rocky bit. I'll make Tim bark like mad.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Suppose
the men have got revolvers?' said Dick, doubtfully. 'They might shoot him.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
bet they haven't,' said George. 'Do go, Dick! The men are almost here. There's
the light of their torch.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
sped after the stumbling Anne. He told Julian what George Jbad suggested. 'Good
for George!' said Julian. 'She really is marvellous - not afraid of anything !
She will keep the men off till I get poor old Anne back.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
was crouching behind the rocky bit, her hand on Tim's collar, waiting. 'Now,
Tim!' she whispered. 'Bark your loudest. Now!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timothy
had been growling up till now, but at George's command he opened his big mouth
and barked. How he barked! He had a simply enormous voice, and the barks went
echoing all down the dark and narrow<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>passage.
The hurrying men, who were near the rocky piece of the passage, stopped.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'If
you come round this bend, I'll set my dog on you!' cried George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'It's
a child shouting,' said one man to another. 'Only a child! Come on!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timothy
barked again, and pulled at his collar, He was longing to get at the men. The
light of their torch shone round the bend. George let Tim go, and the big dog
sprang joyfully round the curve to meet his enemies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
suddenly saw him by the light of their torch, and he was a very terrifying
sight! To begin with, he was a big dog, and now that he was angry all the hairs
on the back of his neck had risen up, making him look even more enormous. His
teeth were bared and glinted in the torch-light.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
men did not like the look of him at all. 'If you move one step nearer I'll tell
my dog to fly at you!' shouted George. 'Wait, Tim, wait! Stand there till I
give the word.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
dog stood in the light of the torch, growling deeply. He looked an extremely
fierce animal. The men looked at him doubtfully. One man took a step forward
and George heard him. At once she shouted to Tim.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Go
for him, Tim, go for him!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Tim
leapt at the man's throat. He took him completely by surprise and the man fell
to the ground with a thud, trying to beat off the dog. The other man helped.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Call
off your dog or we'll hurt him!5 cried the second man.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'It's
much more likely he'll hurt you I' said George,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>coming
out from behind the rock and enjoying the fun. 'Tim, come off.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Tim
came away from the man he was worrying, looking up at his mistress as if to say
'I was having such a good time! Why did you spoil it ?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Who
are you ?' said the man on the ground.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Tm
not answering any of your questions,' said George. 'Go back to Kirrin
Farm-house, that's my advice to you. If you dare to come along this passage
I'll set my dog on to you again - and next time he'll do a little more damage.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
men turned and went back the way they had come. They neither of them wanted to
face Tim again. George waited until she could no longer see the light of their
torch, then she bent down and patted Timothy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Brave,
good dog!' she said. 'I love you, darling Tim, and you don't know how proud I
am of you! Come along - we'll hurry after the others now. I expect those two
men will explore this passage some time tonight, and won't they get a shock
when they find out where it leads to, and see who is waiting for them!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
hurried along the rest of the long passage, with Tim running beside her. She
had Dick's torch, and it did not take her long to catch the others up. She
panted out to them what had happened, and even poor Anne chuckled in delight
when she heard how Tim had flung Mr. Wilton to the ground.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Here
we are,' said Julian, as the passage came to a stop below the hole in the study
floor, 'Hallo - what's this?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
bright light was shining down the hole, and the<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>rug
and carpet, so carefully pulled over the hole by Julian, were now pulled back
again. The children gazed up in surprise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Uncle
Quentin was there, and Aunt Fanny, and when they saw the children's faces
looking up at them from the hole, they were so astonished that they very nearly
fell down the hole too!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Julian!
Anne! What in the wide world are you doing down there?' cried Uncle Quentin. He
gave them each a hand up, and the four children and Timothy were at last safe
in the warm study. How good it was to feel warm again! They got as near the
fire as they could.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Children
- what is the meaning of this?' asked Aunt Fanny. She looked white and worried.
'I came into the study to do some dusting, and when I stood on that bit of the
rug, it seemed to give way beneath me. When I pulled it up and turned back the
carpet, I saw that hole -and the hole in the panelling too! And then I found
that all of you had disappeared, and went to fetch your uncle. What has been
happening - and where does that hole lead to?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
took the sheaf of papers from under his jersey and gave them to George. She
took them and handed them to her father. 'Are these the missing pages?' she
asked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Her
father fell on them as if they had been worth more than a hundred times their
weight in gold. 'Yes! Yes! They're the pages - all three of them! Thank
goodness they're back. They took me three years to bring to perfection, and
contained the heart of my secret formula. George, where did you get them ?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'It's
a very long story,' said George. 'You tell it all, Julian, I feel tired.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
began to tell the tale. He left out nothing. He told how George had found Mr.
Roland snooping about the study - how she had felt sure that the tutor had not
wanted Timmy in the house because the dog gave warning of his movements at
night - how George had seen him talking to the two artists, although he had
said he did not know them. As the tale went on, Uncle Quentin and Aunt Fanny
looked more and more amazed. They simply could not believe it all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
after all, there were the missing papers, safely back. That was marvellous.
Uncle Quentin hugged the papers as if they were a precious baby. He would not
put them down for a moment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
told the bit about Timmy keeping the men off the escaping children. 'So you
see, although you made poor Tim live out in the cold, away from me, he really
saved us all, and your papers too,' she said to her father, fixing her
brilliant blue eyes on him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Her
father looked most uncomfortable. He felt very guilty for having punished
George and Timothy. They had been right about Mr. Roland and he had been wiong.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Poor
George,' he said, 'and poor Timmy. I'm sorry about all that.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
did not bear malice once anyone had owned themselves to be in the wrong. She
smiled at her father.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'It's
all right,' she said. 'But don't you think that as I was punished unfairly, Mr.
Roland might be punished well and truly ? He deserves it!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh,
he shall be, certainly he shall be,' promised her father. 'He's up in bed with
a cold, as you know. I hope he doesn't hear any of this, or he may try to
escape.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'He
can't,' said George. 'We're snowed up. You could ring up the police, and
arrange for them to come here as soon as ever they can manage it, when the snow
has cleared. And I rather think those other two men will try to explore the secret
way as soon as possible, to get the papers back. Could we catch them when they
arrive, do you think?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Rather!'
said Uncle Quentin, though Aunt Fanny looked as if she didn't want any more
exciting things to happen! 'Now look here, you seem really frozen all of you,
and you must be hungry too, because it's almost dinner-time. Go into the
dining-room and sit by the fire, and Joanna shall bring us all a hot lunch.
Then we'll talk about what to do.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Nobody
said a word to Mr. Roland, of course. He lay in bed, coughing now and then.
George had slipped up and locked his door. She wasn't going to have him
wandering out and overhearing anything!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all enjoyed their hot dinner, and became warm and cosy. It was nice to sit
there together, talking over their adventure, and planning what to do.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
will telephone to the police, of course,' said Uncle Quentin. 'And tonight we
will put Timmy into the study to give the two artists a good welcome if they
arrive!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr.
Roland was most annoyed to find his door locked that afternoon when he took it
into his head to dress and go downstairs. He banged on it indignantly. George<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>grinned
and went upstairs. She had told the other children how she had locked the door.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'What's
the matter, Mr. Roland?' she asked, in a polite voice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh,
it's you, George, is it?' said the tutor. 'Well, see what's the matter with my
door, will you ? I can't open it.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
had pocketed the key when she had locked the door. She answered Mr. Roland in a
cheerful voice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh
Mr. Roland, there's no key in your door, so I can't unlock it. I'll see if I
can find it!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr.
Roland was angry and puzzled. He couldn't understand why his door was locked
and the key gone. He did not guess that everyone knew about him now. Uncle
Quentin laughed when George went down and told him about the locked door.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'He
may as well be kept a prisoner,' he said. 'He can't escape now.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>That
night, everyone went to bed early, and Timmy was left in the study, guarding
the hole. Mr. Roland had become more and more angry and puzzled when his door
was not unlocked. He had shouted for Uncle Quentin, but only George had come.
He could not understand it. George, of course, was enjoying herself. She made
Timothy bark outside Mr. Roland's door, and this puzzled him too, for he knew
that George was not supposed to see Timmy for\three days. Wild thoughts raced
through his head. Had that fierce, impossible child locked up her father and
mother and Joanna, as well as himself? He could not imagine what had happened.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the middle of the night Timmy awoke everyone<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>by
barking madly. Uncle Quentin and the children hurried downstairs, followed by
Aunt Fanny, and the amazed Joanna. A fine sight met their eyes!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr.
Wilton and Mr. Thomas were in the study crouching behind the sofa, terrified of
Timothy, who was barking for all he was worth! Timmy was standing by the hole
in the stone floor, so that the two men could not escape down there. Artful
Timmy! He had waited in silence until the men had crept up the hole into the
study, and were exploring it, wondering where they were - and then the dog had
leapt to the hole to guard it, preventing the men from escaping.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Good
evening, Mr. Wilton, good evening, Mr. Thomas', said George, in a polite voice.
'Have you come to see our tutor Mr. Roland ?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'So
this is where he lives!' said Mr. Wilton. 'Was it you in the passage today ?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Yes
- and my cousins,' said George. 'Have you come to look for the papers you stole
from my father?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
two men were silent. They knew they were caught. Mr. Wilton spoke after a
moment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Where's
Roland?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Shall
we take these men to Mr. Roland, Uncle?' asked Julian, winking at George.
'Although it's in the middle of the night I'm sure he would love to see them.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Yes,'
said his uncle, jumping at once to what the boy meant to do. 'Take them up.
Timmy, you go too.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
men followed Julian upstairs, Timmy close at their heels. George followed too,
grinning. She handed Julian the key. He unlocked the door and the men went in,
just as Julian switched on the light. Mr. Roland was<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>wide
awake and gave an exclamation of complete amazement when he saw his friends.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Before
they had time to say a word Julian locked the door again and threw the key to
George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'A
nice little bag of prisoners,' he said. 'We will leave old Tim outside the door
to guard them. It's impossible to get out of that window, and anyway, we're
snowed up if they could escape that way.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
went to bed again, but the children found it difficult to sleep after such an
exciting time. Anne and George whispered together and so did Julian and Dick.
There was such a lot to talk about.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Next
day there was a surprise for everyone. The police did arrive after all! The
snow did not stop them, for somewhere or other they had got skis and had come
skimming along valiantly to see the prisoners! It was a great excitement for
everyone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'We
won't take the men away, sir, till the snow has gone,' said the Inspector.
'We'll just put the handcuffs on them, so that they don't try any funny tricks.
You keep the door locked too, and that dog outside. They'll be safe there for a
day or two. We've taken them enough food till we come back again. If they go a
bit short, it will serve them right!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
snow melted two days later, and the police took away Mr. Roland and the others.
The children watched them go.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'No
more lessons these holls!' said Anne gleefully.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'No
more shutting Timothy out of the house,' said George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'You
were right and we were wrong, George,' said<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian.
'You were fierce, weren't you -,but it's a jolly good thing you were!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'She
is fierce, isn't she?' said Dick, giving the girl a sudden hug. 'But I rather
like her when she's fierce, don't you, Julian ? Oh George, we do have
marvellous adventures with you! I wonder if we'll have any more?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
will - there isn't a doubt of that!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>THE
END<o:p></o:p></span></p>
