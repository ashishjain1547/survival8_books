four sleeping-bags - I say, what about Timmy? Isn't he going to have a
sleeping-bag too?' said Dick, with a grin.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>The other three children laughed, and
Timmy, the dog, thumped his tail hard on the ground.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

too! He's got his mouth stretched wide open.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>They all looked at Timmy. He really did
look as if a wide grin stretched his hairy mouth from side to side.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'He's a darling,' said Anne, hugging him.
'Best dog in the world, aren't you, Timmy?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Woof!' said Timmy, agreeing. He gave Anne
a wet lick on her nose.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>The four children, Julian, tall and strong
for his age, Dick, George and Anne were busy planning a camping holiday. George
was a girl, not a boy, but she would never answer to her real name, <st1:place
w:st="on">Georgina</st1:place>. With her freckled face and short, curly hair
she really did look more like a boy than a girl.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'It's absolutely wizard, being allowed to
go on a camping holiday all by ourselves,' said Dick. 'I never thought our
parents would allow it, after the terrific adventure we had last summer, when
we went off in caravans.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Well - we shan't be quite all by
ourselves,' said Anne. 'Don't forget we've got Mr Luffy to keep an eye<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>on us. He'll be camping quite near.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Pooh! Old Luffy!' said Dick, with a laugh.
'He won't know if we're there or not. So long as he can study his precious
moorland insects, he won't bother about us.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Well, if it hadn't been that he was going
to camp, too, we wouldn't have been allowed to go,' said Anne. 'I heard Daddy
say so.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Mr Luffy was a master at the boys' school,
an elderly, dreamy fellow with a passion for studying all kinds of insect-life.
Anne avoided him when he carried about boxes of insect specimens, because
sometimes they escaped and came crawling out. The boys liked him and thought him
fun, but the idea of Mr Luffy keeping an eye on them struck them as very
comical.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'It's more likely we'll have to keep an eye
on him,' said Julian. 'He's the sort of chap whose tent will always be falling
down on top of him, or he'll run out of water, or sit down on his bag of eggs.
Old Luffy seems to live in the world of insects, not in our world!' seems to
live in the world of insects, not in our world!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Well, he can go and live in the world of
insects if he likes, so long as he doesn't interfere with us,' said George, who
hated interfering people. 'This sounds as if it will be a super holiday -
living in tents on the high moors, away from everybody, doing exactly what we
like, when we like and how we like.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Woof!' said Timmy, thumping his tail
again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'That means he's going to do as he likes,
too,' said Anne. 'You're going to chase hundreds of rabbits, aren't you, Timmy,
and bark madly at anyone who dares to come within two miles of us!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Now be quiet a minute, Anne!' said Dick,
picking up his list again. 'We really must check down our list and find out if
we've got every single thing we want. Where did I get to - oh, four
sleeping-bags.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Yes, and you wanted to know if Timmy was
to have one,' said Anne, with a giggle.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>'Of
course he won't,' said George. 'He'll sleep where he always does - won't you,
Timmy? On my feet.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Couldn't we get him just a small
sleeping-bag?' asked Anne. 'He'd look sweet with his head poking out of the
top.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Timmy hates looking sweet,' said George.
'Go on, Dick. I'll tie my hanky round Anne's mouth if she interrupts again.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Dick went on down his list. It was a very
interesting one. Things like cooking-stoves, canvas buckets, enamel plates and
drinking-cups were on it and each item seemed to need a lot of discussion. The
four children enjoyed themselves very much.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'You know, it's almost as much fun planning
a holiday like this as having it,' said Dick. 'Well - I shouldn't think we've
forgotten a thing, have we?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'No. We've probably thought of too much!'
said Julian. 'Well, old Luffy says he'll take all our things on the trailer
behind his car, so we'll be all right. I shouldn't like to carry them
ourselves!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Oh, I wish next week would come!' said
Anne. 'Why is it that the time seems so long when you're waiting for something
nice to happen, and so short when something nice is happening?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Yes, it seems the wrong way round, doesn't
it?' said Dick, with a grin. 'Anyone got the map? I'd like to take another
squint at the spot where we're going.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Julian produced a map from his pocket. He
opened it and the four children sprawled round it. The map showed a vast and
lonely stretch of moorland, with very few houses indeed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Just a few small<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>farms,<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>that's all,' <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>said Julian<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>pointing to one or two. 'They can't get
much of a living out of such poor land, though. See, that's about the place
where we're going - just there - and on the opposite slope is a small farm
where we shall get milk, eggs and butter when we need them. Luffy's been there
before. He says it's a rather small farm, but jolly useful to campers.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'These moors are awfully high, aren't
they?' said George. 'I guess they'll be freezing cold in the winter.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'They are,' said Julian. 'And they may be
jolly windy and cold in the summer, too, so Luffy says we'd better take
sweaters and things. He says in the winter they are covered with snow for
months. The sheep have to be dug out when they get lost.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Dick's finger followed a small winding road
that made its way over the wild stretch of moorland. 'That's the road we go,'
he said. 'And I suppose we strike off here, look, where a cart-track is shown.
That would go to the farm. We shall have to carry our stuff from wherever Luffy
parks his car, and take it to our camping-place.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Not too near Luffy, I hope,' said George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Oh, no. He's agreed to keep an eye on us,
but he'll forget all about us once he's settled down in his own tent,' said
Julian. 'He will, really. Two chaps I know once went out in his car with him
for a day's run, and he came back without them in the evening. He'd forgotten
he had them with him, and had left them wandering somewhere miles and miles
away.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Good old Luffy,' said Dick. 'That's the
sort of fellow we want! He won't come springing up to ask if we've cleaned our
teeth or if we've got our warm jerseys on!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>The others laughed, and Timmy stretched his
doggy mouth into a grin again. His tongue hung out<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>happily. It was good to have all four of
his friends with him again, and to hear them planning a holiday. Timmy went to
school with George and Anne in term time, and he missed the two boys very much.
But he belonged to George, and would not dream of leaving her. It was a good
thing that George's school allowed pets, or George would certainly not have
gone!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Julian folded up the map again. 'I hope all
the things we've ordered will come in good time,&quot; he said. 'We've got
about six days to wait. I'd better keep on reminding Luffy that we're going
with him, or he's quite likely to start without us!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>It was difficult to have to wait so long
now that everything was planned. Parcels came from various stores and were
eagerly opened. The sleeping-bags were fine.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Super!' said Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Smashing!' said George, crawling into
hers. 'Look! I can lace it up at the neck - and it's got a hood thing to come
right over my head. Golly, it's warm! I shan't mind the coldest night if I'm
sleeping in this. I vote we sleep in them tonight.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'What? In our bedrooms?' said Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Yes. Why not? Just to get used to them,'
said George, who felt that a sleeping-bag was a hundred times better than an
ordinary bed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>So that night all four slept on the floor
of their bedrooms in their sleeping-bags, and voted them very comfortable and
as warm as toast.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'The only thing is, Timmy kept wanting to
come right inside mine,' said George, 'and honestly there isn't enough room.
Besides, he'd be cooked.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Well, he seemed to spend half the night on
my tummy,' grumbled Julian. 'I shall jolly well keep the bedroom door shut if
Timmy's going to spend the<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>night flopping on everyone's bag in turn.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'I don't mind the flopping, so much as the
frightful habit he's got of turning himself round and round and round before he
flops down,' complained Dick. 'He did that on me last night. Silly habit of
his.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'He can't help it,' said George at once.
'It's a habit that wild dogs had centuries and centuries ago - they slept in
reeds and rushes, and they got into the way of turning themselves round and
round in them, to trample them down and make themselves a good sleeping-place.
And our dogs go on turning themselves round now, before they go to sleep, even
though there aren't any rushes to trample down.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Well! I wish Timmy would forget his doggy
ancestors were wild dogs with rushy beds, and just remember he's a nice tame
dog with a basket of his own,' said Dick. 'You should see my tummy today! It's
all printed over with his foot-marks.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Fibber!' said Anne. 'You do exaggerate,
Dick. Oh, I do wish Tuesday would come. I'm tired of waiting.' 'It'll come all
right,' said Julian. And so, it did, of course. It dawned bright and sunny,
with a sky that was a deep blue, flecked with tiny white clouds.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Good-weather clouds,' said Julian,
pleased. 'Now let's hope old Luffy has remembered it's today we're starting
off. He's due here at ten o'clock. We're taking sandwiches for the whole party.
Mother thought we'd better, in case Luffy forgot his. If he's remembered them
it won't matter, because we're sure to be able to eat them ourselves. And
there's always Timmy to finish things up!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Timmy was as excited as the four children.
He always knew when something nice was going to happen. His tail was on the wag
the whole time, his tongue hung out, and he panted as if he had been<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>running a race. He kept getting under
everyone's feet, but nobody minded.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Mr Luffy arrived half an hour late, just
when everyone was beginning to feel he had forgotten to come. He was at the
wheel of his big old car, beaming. All the children knew him quite well,
because he lived not far away and often came to play bridge with their father
and mother.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Hallo, hallo!' he cried. 'All ready, I
see! Good for you! Pile the things on the trailer, will you? Mine are there too
but there's plenty of room. I've got sandwiches for everyone, by the way. My
wife said I'd better bring plenty.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'We'll have a fine feast today then,' said
Dick, helping Julian to carry out the folded-up tents and sleeping-bags, while
the girls followed with the smaller things. Soon everything was on the trailer
and Julian made them safe with ropes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>They said good-bye to the watching
grown-ups and climbed excitedly into the car. Mr Luffy started up his engine and
put the lever into first gear with a frightful noise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Good-bye!' called all the grown-ups, and
Julian's mother added a last word. 'DON'T get into any awful adventure this
time!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Of course they won't!' called back Mr
Luffy cheerfully. 'I'll see to that. There are no adventures to be found on a
wild and deserted moor. Good-bye!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Off they went, waving madly, and shouting
goodbye all the way down the road. 'Good-bye! Good-byeeeeee! Hurrah, we're off
at last!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>The car raced down the road, the trailer
bumping madly after it. The holiday had begun!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Mr Luffy was not a good driver. He went too
fast, especially round the corners, and many times Julian looked behind at the
trailer in alarm, afraid that everything would suddenly leap off it at some
sharp bend.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>He saw the bundle of sleeping-bags jump
high into the air, but fortunately they remained on the trailer. He touched Mr
Luffy on the shoulder.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Sir! Could you go a bit slower, please!
The trailer will be empty by the time we arrive, if the luggage leaps about on
it much more.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'My word! I forgot we had a trailer,' said
Mr Luffy, slowing down at once. 'Remind me if I go over thirty-five miles an
hour, will you? Last time I took the trailer with me, I arrived with only half
the goods on it. I don't want that to happen again.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Julian certainly hoped it wouldn't. He kept
a sharp eye on the speedometer, and when it veered towards forty he tapped Mr
Luffy on the arm.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Mr Luffy looked supremely happy. He didn't
like term time, but he loved holidays. Term time interfered with the study of
his beloved insect-world. Now he was off with four nice children he liked, for
a holiday on a moorland he knew was alive with bees, beetles, butterflies and
every other kind of insect he wanted. He looked forward to teaching the four
children quite a lot. They would have been horrified if they guessed this, but
they didn't.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>He was an odd-looking fellow. He had very
untidy, shaggy eyebrows over kind and gentle brown eyes that always reminded
Dick of a monkey's. He had a rather large nose, which looked fiercer than it
was because, unexpectedly, it had quite a forest of hairs growing out of the
nostrils. He had an untidy moustache, and a round chin with a surprising dimple
in the middle of it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>His ears always fascinated Anne. They were
large and turned rather forward, and Mr Luffy could waggle the right one if he
wanted to. To his great sorrow he had never been able to waggle the left one.
His hair was thick and untidy, and his clothes always looked loose, comfortable
and rather too big for him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>The children liked him. They couldn't help
it. He was so odd and gentle and untidy and forgetful - and yet sometimes
unexpectedly fierce. Julian had often told them the story of Tom Killin the
bully.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Mr Luffy had once found Tom bullying a
small new boy in the cloakroom, dragging him round and round it by his belt.
With a roar like an angry bullr Mr Luffy had pounced on the big bully, got him
by the belt, lifted him up and stuck him firmly on a peg in the cloakroom.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'There you stay till you get someone to
lift you down!' Mr Luffy had thundered. 7 can get hold of a belt too, as you
can see!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>And then he had stalked out of the
cloakroom with the small, terrified boy beside him, leaving the bully hung up
high on the peg, quite unable to free himself. And there he had to stay,
because not one of the boys who came pouring in from a game of football would
lift him down.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'And, if the peg hadn't given way under his
weight, he'd be stuck up there still, 'Julian had said with a grin.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Good old Luffy! You'd never think he could
be fierce like that, would you?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Anne loved that story. Mr Luffy became
quite a hero to her after that. She was pleased to sit next to him in the car,
and chatter about all kinds of things. The other three were squashed at the
back with Timmy on their feet. George firmly prevented him from climbing up on
her knee because it was so hot. So he contented himself with trying to stand up
with his paws on the window-ledge and his nose over the side.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>They stopped about half past twelve for
lunch. Mr Luffy had indeed provided sandwiches for everyone. And remarkably
fine ones they were too, made the evening before by Mrs Luffy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Cucumber, -dipped in vinegar! Ham and
lettuce! Egg! Sardine! Oooh, Mr Luffy, your sandwiches are much nicer than
ours,' said Anne, beginning on two together, one cucumber and the other ham and
lettuce.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>They were all very hungry. Timmy had a bit
from everyone, usually the last bite, and watched each sandwich eagerly till
his turn came. Mr Luffy didn't seem to understand that Timmy had to have the
last bite of any sandwich, so Timmy simply took it out of his hand, much to his
surprise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'A clever dog,' he said, and patted him.
'Knows what he wants and takes it. Very clever.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>That pleased George, of course. She thought
that Timmy was the cleverest dog in the world, and indeed it did seem like it
at times. He understood every word she said to him, every pat, every stroke,
every gesture. He would be much, much better at keeping an eye on the four
children and guarding them than forgetful Mr Luffy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>They drank ginger beer and then ate some
ripe plums. Timmy wouldn't have any plums, but he<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>licked up some spilt ginger beer. Then he
snuffed up a few odd crumbs and went to drink at a little stream nearby.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>The party set off again in the car. Anne
fell asleep. Dick gave an enormous yawn and fell asleep too. George wasn't
sleepy, nor was Timmy, but Julian was. He didn't dare to take his eye off the
speedometer, though, because Mr Luffy seemed to be very much inclined to speed
along too fast again, after his good lunch.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'We won't stop for tea till we get there,'
said Mr Luffy suddenly, and Dick woke up with a jump at the sound of his
booming voice. 'We should be there about half past five. Look, you can see the
moorland in the distance now - all ablaze with heather!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Everybody looked ahead, except Anne, who
was still fast asleep. Rising up to the left for miles upon miles was the
heather-covered moorland, a lovely sight to see. It looked wild and lonely and
beautiful, blazing with heather, and shading off into a purple-blue in the
distance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'We take this road to the left, and then
we're on the moors,' said Mr Luffy, swinging violently to the left, and making
the luggage in the trailer jump high again. 'Here we go.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>The car climbed the high moorland road
steadily. It passed one or two small houses, and in the distance the children
could see little farms in clearings. Sheep dotted the moorland, and some of
them stood staring at the car as it drove by.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'We've got about twenty miles to go, I
should think,' said Mr Luffy, jamming on his brakes suddenly to avoid two large
sheep in the middle of the road. 'I wish these creatures wouldn't choose the
centre of the road to gossip in. Hi, get on there! Let me pass!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Timmy yelped and tried to get out of the
car. The sheep hurriedly decided to move, and the car went on. Anne was
thoroughly awake by now, having been almost jerked out of her seat by the
sudden stop.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'What a shame to wake you!' said Mr Luffy,
gazing down at her kindly, and almost running into a ditch by the side of the
road. 'We're nearly there, Anne.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>They climbed steadily, and the wind grew a
little cold. All around the children the moors stretched for mile upon mile,
never-ending. Little streams sometimes splashed right down to the roadway, and
ran beside it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'We can drink the water in these streams,'
said Mr Luffy. 'Crystal clear, and cold as ice! There's one quite near where
we're going to camp.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>That was good news. Julian thought of the
big canvas buckets they had brought. He didn't particularly want to carry those
for miles. If there was a stream near their camping place it would be easy to
get the buckets filled with washing-water.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>The road forked into two. To the right was
a good road, leading on and on. To the left it became not much more than a
cart-track. 'That's the one we take,' said Mr Luffy, and the car jerked and
jolted over it. He was forced to go slowly, and the children had time to see
every little thing they passed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'I shall leave the car here,' said Mr
Luffy, bringing it to a standstill beside a great rock that stood up bare and
grey out of the moor. 'It will be sheltered from the worst winds and rain. I
thought we'd camp over yonder.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>There was a little slope just there, backed
by some enormous gorse bushes. Thick heather grew everywhere. Julian nodded. It
was a good place for camp-<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>ing. Those thick gorse bushes would provide
fine shelter from the winds.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Right, sir,' he said. 'Shall we have tea
first, or unpack now?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Tea first,' said Mr Luffy. 'I've brought a
very good little stove for boiling and cooking things. Better than a wood fire.
That makes kettles and saucepans so black.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'We've got a stove, too,' said Anne. She
scrambled out of the car and looked all round. 'It's lovely here -all heather
and wind and sun! Is that the farm over there - the one we shall go to for eggs
and things?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>She pointed to a tiny farmhouse on the hill
opposite. It stood in a small clearing. In a field behind it were three or four
cows and a horse. A small orchard stood at the side, and a vegetable garden lay
in front. It seemed odd to see such a trim little place in the midst of the
moorland.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>That's Olly's Farm,' said Mr Luffy. 'It's
changed hands, I believe, since I was here three years ago. I hope the new
people are nice. Now - did we leave something to eat for our tea?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>They had, because Anne had wisely put away
a good many sandwiches and bits of cake for tea-time. They sat in the heather,
with bees humming all round them, and munched solidly for fifteen minutes.
Timmy waited patiently for his bits, watching the bees that hummed round him.
There were thousands of them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'And now I suppose we'd better put up our
tents,' said Julian. 'Come on, Dick - let's unpack the trailer. Mr Luffy, we
don't intend to camp on top of you, sir, because you won't want four noisy
children too near. Where would you like your tent put?' Mr Luffy was about to
say that he would like to have<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>the four children and Timmy quite close,
when it suddenly occurred to him that perhaps they might not want him too near.
They might want to make a noise, or play silly games, and if he were near it
would stop them enjoying themselves in their own way.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>So he made up his mind not to be too close.
Til pitch my tent down there, where that old gorse bush is,' he said. 'And if you'd
like to put yours up here, where there's a half-circle of gorse bushes keeping
off the wind, you'd be well sheltered. And we shan't interfere with one another
at all.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Right, sir,' said Julian, and he and Dick
began to tackle the tents. It was fun. Timmy got under everyone's feet as
usual, and ran off with an important rope, but nobody minded.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>By the time that dusk came creeping up the
heather-covered moorland, all three tents were up, the ground-sheets were put
down, and the sleeping-bags unrolled on them, two in each of the children's
tents, and one in Mr Luffy's.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'I'm going to turn in,' said Mr Luffy. 'My
eyes are almost shut. Good night all of you. Sleep well!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>He disappeared into the dusk. Anne yawned
widely, and that set the others off too. 'Come on - let's turn in, too,' said
Julian. 'We'll have a bar of chocolate each, and a few biscuits. We can eat
those in our sleeping-bags. Good night, girls. Won't it be grand to wake up
tomorrow morning?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>He and Dick disappeared into their tent.
The girls crawled into theirs with Timmy. They undressed, and got into their
warm, soft sleeping-bags.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'This is super!' said George, pushing Timmy
to one side. 'I never felt so cosy in my life. Don't do that, Timmy. Don't you
know the difference between my feet and my middle? That's better.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Good night,' said Anne, sleepily. 'Look,
George, you can see the stars shining through the opening of the tent. Don't
they look enormous?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>But George didn't care whether they were
enormous or not. She was fast asleep, tired out with the day's run. Timmy
cocked one ear when he heard Anne's voice, and gave a little grunt. That was
his way of saying good night. Then he put his head down and slept.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Our first night of camping,' thought Anne,
happily. 'I shan't go to sleep. I shall lie awake and look at the stars and
smell that heathery smell.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Julian awoke first in the morning. He heard
a strange and lonely sound floating overhead. 'Coor-lie! Coor-lie!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>He sat up and wondered where he was and who
was calling. Of course! He was in his tent with Dick - they were camping on the
moors. And that wild cry overhead came from a curlew, the bird of the
moorlands.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>He yawned and lay down again. It was early
in the morning. The sun put its warm fingers in at his tent opening, and he
felt the warmth on his sleeping-bag. He felt lazy and snug and contented. He
also felt hungry, which was a nuisance. He glanced at his watch.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Half past six. He really was too warm and
comfortable to get up yet. He put out his hand to see if there was any
chocolate left from the night before, and found a little piece. He put it into
his mouth and lay there contentedly, listening to more curlews, and watching
the sun climb a little higher.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>He fell asleep again, and was awakened by
Timmy busily licking his face. He sat up with a start. The girls were peering
in at his tent, grinning. They were fully dressed already.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Wake up, lazy!' said Anne. 'We sent Timmy
in to get you up. It's half past seven. We've been up for ages/<o:p></o:p></span></p>

up. We're going to find the stream and wash in it. It seems silly to lug heavy

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Dick awoke too. He and Julian decided to go
and take a bathe in the stream. They wandered out into the sunny morning,
feeling very happy and very hungry. The girls were just coming back from the
stream.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'It's over there,' said Anne, pointing.
'Timmy, go with them and show them. It's a lovely little brown stream, awfully
cold, and it's got ferns along its banks. We've left the bucket there. Bring it
back full, will you?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'No, let him sleep,' said Julian. 'He's
probably tired out with driving the car so slowly! We can easily save him some
breakfast. What are we going to have?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'We've unpacked some bacon rashers and
tomatoes, ' said Anne, who loved cooking. 'How do you light the stove, Julian?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'George knows,' said Julian. 'I say, did we
pack a frying-pan?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Yes. I packed it myself,' said Anne. 'Do
go and bathe if you're going to. Breakfast will be ready before you are!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Timmy gravely trotted off with the boys and
showed them the stream. Julian and Dick at once lay down in the clear brown
bed, and kicked wildly. Timmy leapt in too, and there were yells and shrieks.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Well - I should think we've woken up old Luffy
now!' said Dick, rubbing himself down with a rough towel. 'How lovely and cold
that was. The trouble is it's made me feel twice as hungry!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Doesn't that frying bacon smell good?'
said Julian, sniffing the air. They walked back to the girls. There was still
no sign of Mr Luffy. He must indeed sleep very soundly!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>They sat down in the heather and began
their breakfast. Anne had fried big rounds of bread in the fat, and the boys
told her she was the best cook in the world. She was very pleased.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'I shall look after the food side for you,'
she said. 'But George muist help with the preparing of the meals and
washing-up. See, George?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>George didn't see. She hated doing all the
things that Anne loved to do, such as making beds and washing-up. She looked
sulky.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Look at old George! Why bother about the
washing-up when there's Timmy only too pleased to use his tongue to wash every
plate?' said Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Everyone laughed, even George. 'All right,'
she said, Til help of course. Only let's use as few plates as possible, then
there won't be much washing-up. Is there any more fried bread, Anne?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'No. But there are some biscuits in that
tin,' said Anne. 'I say, boys, who's going to go to the farm each day for milk
and things? I expect they can let us have bread, too, and fruit.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Oh, one or other of us will go,' said
Dick. 'Anne, hadn't you better fry something for old Luffy now? I'll go and
wake him. Half the day will be gone if he doesn't get up now.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Til go and make a noise like an earwig
outside his tent,' said Julian, getting up. 'He might not wake with<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>all our yells and shouts, but he'd
certainly wake at the call of a friendly earwig!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>He went down to the tent. He cleared his
throat and called politely: 'Are you awake yet, sir?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>There was no answer. Julian called again.
Then, puzzled, he went to the tent opening. The flap was closed. He pulled it
aside and looked in.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>The tent was empty! There was nobody there
at all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'What's up, Ju?' called Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'He's not here,' said Julian. 'Where can he
be?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>There was silence. For a panic-stricken
moment Anne thought one of their strange adventures was beginning. Then Dick
called out again: 'Is his bug-tin gone? You know, the tin box with straps that
he takes with him when he goes insect-hunting? And what about his clothes?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Julian inspected the inside of the tent
again. 'Okay!' he called, much to everyone's relief. 'His clothes are gone, and
so has his bug-tin. He must have slipped out early, before we were awake. I bet
he's forgotten all about us and breakfast and everything!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'That would be just like him,' said Dick.
'Well, we're not his keepers. He can do as he likes! If he doesn't want
breakfast, he needn't have any. He'll come back when he's finished his hunting,
I suppose.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Anne! Can you get on with the doings if
Dick and I go to the farmhouse and see what food they've got?' asked Julian.
'The time's getting on, and if we're going for a walk or anything today, we
don't want to start too late.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Right,' said Anne. 'You go too, George. I
can manage everything nicely, now that the boys have brought me a bucketful of
water. Take Timmy. He wants a walk.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>George was only too pleased to get out of
the washing-up. She and the boys, with Timmy trotting in front, set off to the
farmhouse. Anne got on with her jobs, humming softly to herself in the
sunshine. She soon finished them, and then looked to see if the others were
coming back. There was no sign of them, or of Mr Luffy either.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Til go for a walk on my own,' thought Anne.
Til follow that little stream uphill and see where it begins. That would be
fun. I can't possibly lose my way if I keep by the water.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>She set off in the sunshine and came to the
little brown stream that gurgled down the hill. She scrambled through the
heather beside it, following its course uphill. She liked all the little green
ferns and the cushions of velvety moss that edged it. She tasted the water - it
was cold and sweet and clean.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Feeling very happy all by herself, Anne
walked on and on. She came at last to a big mound of a hill-top. The little
stream began there, half-way up the mound. It came gurgling out of the heathery
hillside, edged with moss, and made its chattering way far down the hill.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>'So
that's where you begin, is it?' said Anne. She flung herself down on the
heather, hot with her climb. It was nice there, with the sun on her face, and
the sound of the trickling water nearby.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>She lay listening to the humming bees and
the water. And then she heard another sound. She took no notice of it at all at
first.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Then she sat up, frightened. 'The noise is
underground! Deep, deep underground! It rumbles and roars. Oh, what is going to
happen? Is there going to be an earthquake!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>The rumbling seemed to come nearer and
nearer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Anne didn't even dare to get up and run.
She sat there and trembled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Then there came an unearthly shriek, and
not far off a most astonishing thing happened. A great cloud of white smoke
came right out of the ground and hung in the air before the wind blew it away.
Anne was simply horrified. It was so sudden, so very unexpected on this quiet
hillside. The rumbling noise went on for a while and then gradually faded away.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Anne leapt to her feet in a panic. She fled
down the hill, screaming loudly: 'It's a volcano! Help! Help! I've been sitting
on a volcano. It's going to burst, it's sending out smoke. Help, help, it's a
VOLCANO!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>She tore down the hillside, caught her foot
on a tuft of heather and went rolling over and over, sobbing. She came to rest
at last, and then heard an anxious voice calling:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Who's that? What's the matter?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>It was Mr Luffy's voice. Anne screamed to
him in relief. 'Mr Luffy! Come and save me! There's a volcano here!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>There was such terror in her voice that Mr
Luffy came racing to her at once. He sat down beside the trembling girl and put
his arm round her. 'Whatever's the matter?' he said. 'What's frightened you?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Anne told him again. 'Up there- do you see?
That's a volcano, Mr Luffy. It trembled and rumbled and then it shot up clouds
of smoke. Oh quick, before it sends out red hot cinders!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Now, now!' said Mr Luffy, and to Anne's
surprise and relief he actually laughed. 'Do you mean to tell me you don't know
what that was?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'No, I don't,' said Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Well,' said Mr Luffy, 'under this big moor
run two or three long tunnels to take trains from one valley to<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>another. Didn't you know? They make the
rumbling noise you heard, and the sudden smoke you saw was the smoke sent up by
a train below. There are big vent-holes here and there in the moor for the
smoke to escape from.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Oh, good gracious me!' said Anne, going
rather red. 'I didn't even know there were trains under here. What an extraordinary
thing! I really did think I was sitting on a volcano, Mr Luffy. You won't tell
the others will you. They would laugh at me dreadfully.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'I won't say a word,' said Mr Luffy. 'And
now I think we'll go back. Have you had breakfast? I'm terribly hungry. I went
out early after a rather rare butterfly I saw flying by my tent.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'We've had breakfast ages ago,' said Anne.
'But if you like to come back with me now I'll cook you some bacon, Mr Luffy.
And some tomatoes and fried bread.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Aha! It sounds good,' said Mr Luffy. 'Now

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'The farmer's got a fine car,' went on
Julian. 'Brand new. Must have cost him a pretty penny. His boy showed it to us.
And he showed us some jolly good new farm machinery too.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Very interesting,' said Mr Luffy. 'I
wonder how they make their money, farming that bit of land? The last people
were hard-working folk, but they certainly couldn't have afforded a new car or
a grand piano.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'And you should have seen the lorries
they've got!' said Dick. 'Beauties! Old army ones, I should think. The boy said
his father's going to use them for carting things from the farm to the market.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'What things?' said Mr Luffy, looking
across at the little farmhouse. 'I shouldn't have thought they needed an army
of lorries for that! An old farm wagon would carry all their produce.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Well, that's what he told us,' said Dick.
'Everything certainly looked very prosperous, I must say. He must be a jolly
good farmer.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'We got eggs and butter and fruit, and even
some bacon,' said George. 'The boy's mother didn't seem worried about how much
we had, and she hardly charged us anything. We didn't see the farmer.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Mr Luffy was now eating his breakfast. He
was certainly very hungry. He brushed away the flies that hung round his head,
and when one settled on his right ear he waggled it violently. The fly flew off
in surprise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Oh, do that again!' begged Anne. 'How do
you do it? Do you think if I practised hard for weeks I could make my ear
move?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'No, I don't think so,' said Mr Luffy,
finishing his breakfast. 'Well, I've got some writing to do now. What are you
going to do? Go for a walk?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'We might as well take a picnic lunch and
go off somewhere,' said Julian. 'How about it?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Yes,&quot; said Dick. 'Can you pack us
dinner and tea, Anne? We'll help. What about hard-boiled eggs?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>It wasn't long before they had a picnic meal
packed in greaseproof paper.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'You won't get lost, will you?' said Mr
Luffy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Oh no, sir,' said Julian, with a laugh.
'I've got a compass, anyway, and a jolly good bump of locality, too. I usually
know the way to go. We'll see you this evening, when we get back.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'You won't get lost, Mr Luffy, will you?'
asked Anne, looking worried.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Don't be cheeky, Anne,' said Dick, rather
horrified at Anne's question. But she really meant it. Mr Luffy was so
absent-minded that she could quite well picture him wandering off and not being
able to find his way back.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>He smiled at her. 'No,' he said. 'I know my
way about here all right-I know every stream and path and er-volcano!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Anne giggled. The others stared at Mr
Luffy, wondering what in the world he meant, but neither he nor Anne told them.
They said good-bye and set off.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'It's heavenly walking today,' said Anne.
'Shall we follow a path if we find one or not?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Might as well,' said Julian. 'It'll be a
bit tiring scrambling through heather all the day.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>So when they did unexpectedly come across a
path they followed it. 'It's just a shepherd's path, I expect,' said Dick. 'I
bet it's a lonely job, looking after sheep up on these desolate heathery
hills.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>They went on for some way, enjoying the
stretches of bright heather, the lizards that darted quickly away from their
feet and the hosts of butterflies of all kinds that hovered and fluttered. Anne
loved the little blue ones best and made up her mind to ask Mr Luffy what all their
names were.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>They had their lunch on a hill-top
overlooking a vast stretch of heather, with grey-white blobs in it here and
there - the sheep that wandered everywhere.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>And, in the very middle of the meal, Anne
heard the same rumbling she had heard before, and then, not far off, out
spouted some white smoke from the ground. George went quite pale. Timmy leapt
to his feet, growling and barking, his tail down. The boys roared with
laughter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'It's all right, Anne and George. It's only
the trains underground here. We knew they ran under the moors and we thought
we'd see what you did when you first heard them rumbling, and saw the smoke.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'I'm not a bit frightened,' said Anne, and
the boys looked at her, astonished. It was George who was the scared one!
Usually it was quite the other way round.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>George got back her colour and laughed. She
called Timmy. 'It's all right, Tim. Come here. You know<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>what trains are, don't you?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>The children discussed the trains. It
really did seem strange to think of trains in those hollowed-out tunnels down
below the moors - the people in them, reading their newspapers and talking -
down in tunnels where the sun never shone at all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Come on,' said Julian, at last. 'Let's go
on. We'll walk to the top of the next slope, and then I think we ought to turn
back.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>They found a little path that Julian said
must be a rabbit-path, because it was so narrow, and set off, chattering and
laughing. They climbed through the heather to the top of the next slope. And at
the top they got quite a surprise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Down in the valley below was a silent and
deserted stretch of railway lines! They appeared out of the black hole of a
tunnel-mouth, ran for about half a mile, and then ended in what seemed to be a
kind of railway yard.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Look at that,' said Julian- 'Old derelict
lines - not used any more, I should think. I suppose that tunnel's out of date,
too.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Let's go down and have a squint,' said
Dick. 'Come on! We've got plenty of time, and we can easily go back a shorter
way.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>They set off down the hill to the lines.
They arrived some way from the tunnel-mouth, and followed the lines to the
deserted railway yard. There seemed to be nobody about at all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Look,' said Dick, 'there are some old wagons
on that set of lines over there. They look as if they haven't been used for a
hundred years. Let's give them a shove and set them going!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Oh, no!' said Anne, afraid. But the two
boys and George, who had always longed to play about with<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>real railway trucks, ran over to where
three or four stood on the lines. Dick and Julian shoved hard at one. It moved.
It ran a little way and crashed into the buffers of another. It made a terrific
noise in the silent yard.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>A door flew open in a tiny hut at the side
of the yard, and a terrifying figure came out. It was a one-legged man, with a
wooden peg for his other leg, two great arms that might quite well belong to a
gorilla, and a face as red as a tomato, except where grey whiskers grew.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>He opened his mouth and the children
expected a loud and angry yell. Instead out came a husky, hoarse whisper:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'What you doing? Ain't it bad enough to
hear spook-trains a-running at night, without hearing them in the daytime,
too?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>The four children stared at him. They
thought he must be quite mad. He came nearer to them, and his wooden leg
tip-tapped oddly. He swung his great arms loosely. He peered at the children as
if he could hardly see them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'I've broken me glasses,' he said, and to
their astonishment and dismay two tears ran down his cheeks. 'Poor old
Wooden-Leg Sam, he's broken his glasses. Nobody cares about Wooden-Leg Sam now,
nobody at all.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>There didn't seem anything to say to all
this. Anne felt sorry for the funny old man, but she kept well behind Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Sam peered at them again. 'Haven't you got
tongues in your heads? Am I seeing things again, or are you there?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'We're here and we're real,' said Julian.
'We happened to see this old railway yard and we came down to have a look at
it. Who are you?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'I told you - I'm Wooden-Leg Sam,' said the
old man impatiently. 'The watchman, see? Though what there is to watch here,
beats me. Do they think I'm going to watch for these spook-trains? Well, I'm
not. Not me, Sam Wooden-Leg. I've seen many strange things in my life, yes, and
been scared by them too, and I'm not watching for any more spook-trains.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>The children listened curiously. 'What
spook-trains?' asked Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Wooden-Leg Sam came closer. He looked all
round as if he thought there might be someone listening, and then spoke in a
hoarser whisper than usual.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Spook-trains, I tell you. Trains that come
out of that tunnel at night all by themselves, and go back all by themselves.
Nobody in them. One night they'll come for old Sam Wooden-Leg-but, see, I'm
smart, I am. I lock myself into my hut and get under the bed. And I blow my
candle out so those spook-trains don't know I'm there.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Anne shivered. She pulled at Julian's hand.
'Julian! Let's go. I don't like it. It sounds all peculiar and horrid. What
does he mean?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>The old man seemed suddenly to change his
mood. He picked up a large cinder and threw it at Dick, hitting him on the
head. 'You clear out! I'm watchman here. And what did They tell me? They told
me to chase away anyone that came. Clear out, I tell you!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>In terror Anne fled away. Timmy growled and
would have leapt at the strange old watchman, but George had her hand on his
collar. Dick rubbed his head where the cinder had hit him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'We're going,' he said, soothingly to Sam.
It was plain that the old fellow was a bit funny in the head. 'We didn't mean
to trespass. You look after your spook-trains. We won't interfere with you!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>The boys and George turned away, and caught
up with Anne. 'What did he mean?' she asked, scared. 'What are spook-trains?
Trains that aren't real? Does he really see them at night?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'He just imagines them,' said Julian. 'I
expect being there all alone in that deserted old railway yard has made him
think strange things. Don't worry, Anne. There are no such things as
spook-trains.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'But he spoke as if there were,' said Anne,
'he really did. I'd hate to see a spook-train. Wouldn't you Ju?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'No. I'd love to see one,&quot; said
Julian, and he turned to Dick. 'Wouldn't you, Dick? Shall we come one night and
watch? Just to see?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

railway yard behind them and climbed up the heathery slope to find their way

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Well, we've been hearing about
spook-trains!' said Julian, with a laugh. 'Is that what you mean?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Ay. There're trains that nobody knows of
running out of that tunnel,' said the shepherd. 'Many's the time I've heard
them when I've been up here at night with my sheep. That tunnel hasn't been
used for thirty years - but the trains, they still come out of it, just as they
used to.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'How do you know? Have you seen them?'
asked Julian, a cold shiver creeping down his spine quite suddenly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'No. I've only heard them,' said the old
man. 'Choo, choo, they go, and they jangle and clank. But they don't whistle
any more. Old Wooden-Leg Sam reckons they're spook-trains, with nobody to drive
them and nobody to tend them. Don't you go down to that place. It's bad and
scary.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

believe in spook-trains - and neither do you, shepherd. Dick, have you got the
tea in your bag? Let's find a nice place and have some sandwiches and cake.
Will you join us, shepherd?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'No, thank you kindly,' said the old man,
moving off. Til be after my sheep. Always wandering they are, and they keep me
wandering, too. Good day, sir, and don't go down to that bad place.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Julian found a good spot out of sight of
'that bad place', and they all sat down. 'All a lot of nonsense, 'said Julian,
who wanted Anne to feel happier again. 'We can easily ask the farmer's boy
about it tomorrow. I expect it's all a silly tale made up by that old
one-legged fellow, and passed on to the shepherd.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'I expect so,' said Dick. 'You noticed that
the shepherd had never actually seen the trains, Julian? Only heard them. Well,
sound travels far at night, and I expect what he heard was simply the rumblings
of the trains that go underground here. There's one going somewhere now! I can
feel the ground trembling!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>They all could. It was a peculiar feeling.
The rumbling stopped at last and they sat and ate their tea, watching Timmy
scraping at a rabbit-hole and trying his hardest to get down it. He covered
them with sandy soil as he burrowed, and nothing would stop him. He seemed to
have gone completely deaf.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Look here, if we don't get Timmy out of
that hole now he'll be gone down so far that we'll have to drag him out by his
tail,' said Julian, getting up. 'Timmy! TIM-MY! The rabbit's miles away. Come
on out.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>It took both George and Julian to get him
out. He was most indignant. He looked at them as if to say: ' Well, what
spoil-sports! Almost got him and you drag me out!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>He shook himself, and bits of grit and sand
flew out of his hair. He took a step towards the hole again, but George caught
hold of his tail. 'No, Timmy. Home now!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'He's looking for a spook-train,' said
Dick, and that made everyone laugh, even Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>They set off back to the camping-place,
pleasantly tired, with Timmy following rather sulkily at their heels. When they
at last got back they saw Mr Luffy sitting waiting for them. The blue smoke
from his pipe curled up into the air.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Hallo, hallo!' he said, and his brown eyes
looked up at them from under his shaggy eyebrows. 'I was beginning to wonder if
you'd got lost. Still, I suppose that dog of yours would always bring you
back.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Timmy wagged his tail politely. 'Woof,' he
agreed, and went to drink out of the bucket of water. Anne stopped him just in
time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'No, Timmy! You're not to drink out of our
washing-up water. There's yours, in the dish over there.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Timmy went to his dish and lapped. He
thought Anne was very fussy. Anne asked Mr Luffy if he would like any supper.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'We're not having a proper supper,' she
said. 'We had tea so late. But I'll cook you something if you like, Mr Luffy.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Very kind of you. But I've had an enormous
tea,' said Mr Luffy. 'I've brought up a fruit cake for you, from my own larder.
Shall we share it for supper? And I've got a bottle of lime juice, too, which
will taste grand with some of the stream water.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>The boys went off to get some fresh stream
water for drinking. Anne got out some plates and cut slices of the cake.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Well,' said Mr Luffy. 'Had a nice walk?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Yes/ said Anne, 'except that we met a
strange one-legged man who told us he saw spook-trains.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Mr Luffy laughed. 'Well, well! He must be a
cousin of a little girl I know who thought she was sitting on a volcano.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Anne giggled. 'You're not to tease me. No,
honestly, Mr Luffy, this old man was a watchman at a sort of old railway yard -
not used now - and he said when the spook-trains came, he blew out his light
and got under his bed so that they shouldn't get him.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Poor old fellow,' said Mr Luffy. 'I hope
he didn't frighten you.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'He did a bit,' said Anne. 'And he threw a
cinder at Dick and hit him on the head. Tomorrow we're going to the farm to ask
the boy there if he's heard of the spook-trains, too. We met an old shepherd
who said he'd heard them but not seen them.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Well, well - it all sounds most
interesting,' said Mr Luffy. 'But these exciting stories usually have a very
tame explanation, you know. Now would you like to see what I found today? A
very rare and interesting little beetle.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>He opened a small square tin and showed a
shiny beetle to Anne. It had green feelers and a red fiery spot near its
tail-end. It was a lovely little thing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Now that's much more exciting to me than
half a dozen spook-trains,' he told Anne. 'Spook-trains won't keep me awake at
night - but thinking of this little beetle-fellow here certainly will.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'I don't very much like beetles,' said
Anne. 'But this one certainly is pretty. Do you really like hunting about all
day for insects, and watching them, Mr Luffy?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Yes, very much,' said Mr Luffy. 'Ah, here
come the<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>boys with the water. Now we'll hand the
cake round, shall we? Where's George? Oh, there she is, changing her shoes.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>George had a blister, and she had been
putting a strip of plaster on her heel. She came up when the boys arrived and
the cake was handed round. They sat in a circle, munching, while the sun
gradually went down in a blaze of red.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Nice day tomorrow again,' said Julian.
'What shall we do?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'We'll have to go to the farm first,' said
Dick. The farmer's wife said she'd let us have some more bread if we turned up
in the morning. And we could do with more eggs if we can get them. We took
eight hard-boiled ones with us today and we've only one or two left. And who's
eaten all the tomatoes, I'd like to know?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'All of you,' said Anne at once. 'You're
perfect pigs over the tomatoes.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'I'm afraid I'm one of the pigs,'
apologised Mr Luffy. 'I think you fried me six for my breakfast, Anne.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'That's all right,' said Anne. 'You didn't
have as many as the others, even so! We can easily get some more.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>It was pleasant sitting there, eating and
talking, and drinking lime juice and stream water. They were all tired, and it
was nice to think of the cosy sleeping-bags. Timmy lifted his head and gave a
vast yawn, showing an enormous amount of teeth.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Timmy! I could see right down to your tail
then!' said George. 'Do shut your mouth up. You've made us all yawn.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>So he had. Even Mr Luffy was yawning. He
got up. 'Well, I'm going to turn in,' he said. 'Good night.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>We'll make plans tomorrow morning. I'll
bring up some breakfast for you, if you like. I've got some tins of sardines.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Oh, thanks,' said Anne. 'And there's some
of this cake left. I hope you won't think that's too funny a breakfast, Mr
Luffy - sardines and fruit cake?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Not a bit. It sounds a most sensible
meal,' came Mr Luffy's voice from down the hillside. 'Good night!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>The children sat there a few minutes
longer. The sun went right out of sight. The wind grew a little chilly. Timmy
yawned enormously again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Come on,' said Julian. 'Time we turned in.
Thank goodness Timmy didn't come into our tent and walk all over me last night.
Good night, girls. It's going to be a heavenly night - but as I shall be asleep
in about two shakes of a duck's tail, I shan't see much of it!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>The girls went into their tent. They were
soon in their sleeping-bags. Just before they went to sleep Anne felt the
slight shivering of the earth that meant a train was running underground
somewhere. She could hear no rumbling sound. She fell asleep thinking ofit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>The boys were not asleep. They, too, had
felt the trembling of the earth beneath them, and it had reminded them of the
old railway yard.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Funny about those spook-trains, Dick,'
said Julian, sleepily. 'Wonder if there is anything in it.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'No. How could there be?' said Dick. 'All
the same we'll go to the farm tomorrow and have a chat with that boy. He lives
on the moors and he ought to know the truth.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'The real truth is that Wooden-Leg Sam is
potty, and imagines all he says, and the old shepherd is ready to believe in
anything strange,' said Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'I expect you're right,' said Dick. 'Oh my

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>A dark shape stood looking in at the
tent-flap. It gave a little whine.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Oh, it's you, Timmy. Would you mind not
coming and pretending you're a spook-train or something?' said Dick. 'And if
you dare to put so much as half a paw on my middle, I'll scare you down the
hill with a roar like a man-eating tiger. Go away.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Timmy put a paw on Julian. Julian yelled
out to George. 'George! Call this dog of yours, will you? He's just about to
turn himself round twenty times on my middle, and curl himself up for the night.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>There was no answer from George. Timmy,
feeling that he was not wanted, disappeared. He went back to George and curled
himself up on her feet. He put his nose down on his paws and slept.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Spooky Timmy,' murmured Julian,
re-arranging himself. 'Timmy spooky - no, I mean - oh dear, what do I mean?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Shut up,' said Dick. 'What with you and
Timmy messing about, I can't get - to - sleep!' But he could and he did -
almost before he had finished speaking. Silence fell on the little camp, and
nobody noticed when the next train rumbled underground - not even Timmy!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>He went off down the slope to his own tent.
George and Anne washed-up, while the boys tightened some tent ropes that had
come loose, and generally tidied up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'I suppose it's quite all right leaving
everything unguarded like this,' said Anne, anxiously.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Well, we did yesterday,' said Dick. 'And
who's likely to come and take anything up here in this wild and lonely spot,
I'd like to know? You don't imagine a spook-train will come along and bundle
everything into its luggage-van, do you, Anne?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

wondered if we ought to leave Timmy on guard, that's all.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Leave Timmy!' said George, amazed. 'You
don't really think I'd leave Timmy behind every time we go off anywhere, Anne?
Don't be an idiot.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'No, I didn't really think you would,' said
Anne. 'Well, I suppose nobody will come along here. Throw over that tea-cloth,
George, if you've finished with it.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Soon the tea-cloths were hanging over the
gorse bushes to dry in the sun. Everything was put away neatly in the tents. Mr
Luffy had called a loud goodbye and gone. Now the five were ready to go off to
the farm.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Anne took a basket, and gave one to Julian
too. 'To bring back the food,' said she. 'Are you ready to go now?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>They set off over the heather, their knees
brushing through the honeyed flowers, and sending scores of busy bees into the
air. It was a lovely day again, and the children felt free and happy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>They came to the trim little farm. Men were
at work in the fields, but Julian did not think they were very industrious. He
looked about for the farm-boy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>The boy came out of a shed and whistled to
them. 'Hallo! You come for some more eggs? I've collected quite a lot for you.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>He stared at Anne. 'You didn't come
yesterday. What's your name?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Anne,' said Anne. 'What's yours?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Jock,' said the boy, with a grin. He was
rather a nice boy, Anne thought, with straw-coloured hair, blue eyes, and
rather a red face which looked very good-tempered.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Where's your mother?' said Julian. 'Can we
get some bread and other things from her today? We ate an awful lot of our food
yesterday, and we want to stock up our larder again!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'She's busy just now in the dairy,' said
Jock. 'Are you in a hurry? Come and see my pups.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>They all walked off with him to a shed. In
there, right at the end, was a big box lined with straw. A collie dog lay there
with five lovely little puppies. She growled at Timmy fiercely, and he backed
hurriedly out of the shed. He had met fierce mother-dogs before, and he didn't
like them!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>The four children exclaimed over the fat
little puppies, and Anne took one out very gently. It cuddled into her arms and
made funny little whining noises.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'! wish it was mine,' said Anne. 'I should

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'What a frightful name for a dog,' said
George scornfully. 'Just the kind of silly name you would think of, Anne. Let
me hold it. Are they all yours, Jock?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Yes,' said Jock, proudly. 'The mother's
mine, you see. Her name's Biddy.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Biddy pricked up her ears at her name and
looked up at Jock out of bright, alert eyes. He fondled her silky head.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'I've had her for four years,' he said.
'When we were at Owl Farm, old Farmer Burrows gave her to me when she was eight
weeks old.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Oh - were you at another farm before this
one, then?' asked Anne. 'Have you always lived on a farm? Aren't you lucky!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'I've only lived on two,' said Jock. 'Owl
Farm and this one. Mum and I had to leave Owl Farm when Dad died, and we went
to live in a town for a year. I hated that. I was glad when we came here.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'But I thought your father was here!' said
Dick, puzzled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'That's my stepfather,' said Jock. 'He's no
farmer, though!' He looked round and lowered his voice. 'He doesn't know much
about farming. It's my mother that tells the men what to do. Still, he gives her
plenty of money to do everything well, and we've got fine machinery and wagons
and things. Like to see the dairy? It's slap up-to-date and Mum loves working
in it.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Jock took the four children to the shining,
spotless dairy. His mother was at work there with a girl. She nodded and smiled
at the children. 'Good morning! Hungry again? I'll pack you up plenty of food
when I've finished in the dairy. Would you like to stay and have dinner with my
Jock? He's lonely enough here<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>in the holidays, with no other boy to keep
him company.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Oh, yes - do let's!' cried Anne, in
delight. Td like that. Can we, Ju?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Yes. Thank you very much, Mrs - er - Mrs .

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Tm Mrs Andrews,' said Jock's mother. 'But
Jock is Jock Robins - he's the son of my first husband, a farmer. Well, stay to
dinner all of you, and I'll see if I can give you a meal that will keep you
going for the rest of the day!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>This sounded good. The four children felt
thrilled, and Timmy wagged his tail hard. He liked Mrs Andrews.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Come on,' saidjqck, joyfully. Til take you
all round the farm, into every corner. It's not very big, but we're going to
make it the best little farm on the moorlands. My stepfather doesn't seem to
take much interest in the work of the farm, but he'sjolly generous when it
comes to handing out money to Mum to buy everything she wants.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>It certainly seemed to the children that
the machinery on the farm was absolutely up-to-date. They examined the combine,
they went into the little cowshed and admired the clean stone floor with white
brick walls, they climbed into the red-painted wagons, and they wished they
could try the two motor-tractors that stood side by side in a barn.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'You've got plenty of men here to work the
farm,' said Julian. 'I shouldn't have thought there was enough for so many to
do on this small place.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'They're not good workers,' said Jock, his
face creasing into frowns. 'Mum's always getting wild with them. They just
don't know what to do. Dad gives her plenty of men to work the farm, but he<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>always chooses the wrong ones! They don't
seem to like farm-work, and they're always running off to the nearest town
whenever they can. There's only one good fellow and he's old. See him over
there? His name's Will.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The
children looked at Will. He was working in the little vegetable garden, an old
fellow with a shrivelled face, a tiny nose and a pair of very blue eyes. They
liked the look of him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Yes. He looks like a farm-worker,' said
Julian. 'The others don't.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'He won't work with them,' said Jock. 'He

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'An idiot, silly,' said Dick. He walked up
to old Will. 'Good morning,' he said. 'You're very busy. There's always a lot
to do on a farm, isn't there?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>The old fellow looked at Dick out of his
very blue eyes, and went on with his work. 'Plenty to do and plenty of folk to
do it, and not much done,' he said, in a croaking kind of voice. 'Never thought
I'd be put to work with ninnies and idjits. Not ninnies and idjits!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'There! What did I tell you?' said Jock,
with a grin. 'He's always calling the other men that, so wejust have to let him
work right away from them. Still, I must say he's about right - most of the
fellows here don't know the first thing about work on a farm. I wish my
stepfather would let us have a few proper workers instead of these fellows.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Where's your stepfather?' said Julian,
thinking he must be rather peculiar to pour money into a little moorland farm
like this, and yet choose the wrong kind of workers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'He's away for the day,' said Jock. 'Thank

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'He's all right,' said Jock. 'But he's not
a farmer, though he makes out he's always wanted to be - and what's more he
doesn't like me one bit. I try to like him for Mum's sake. But I'm always glad
when he's out of the way.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

locked. 'I told you what was in here before,' said Jock. 'Lorries! You can peek
through that hole here at them. Don't know why my stepfather wanted to buy up
so many, but I suppose he got them cheap - he loves to get things cheap and
sell them dear! He did say they'd be useful on the farm, to take goods to the
market.' i<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Mrs Andrews handed them a chocolate each and sent them out of doors. 'You go
and have a rest now,' she said. 'Talk to Jock. He doesn't get enough company of

didn't seem to mind a bit. Anne cuddled the fat little thing against her, and
went off to the others, feeling very happy. The boys had found a fine place

them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'I'd like to go down to that old railway
yard with you and see Wooden-Leg Sam,' said Jock longingly. 'Why, that would be
a real adventure to me, you know -just talking to a funny old man like that,

next time you go.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

again,' said Julian. 'There's really nothing much in his story except
imagination - the old watchman's gone peculiar in the head through being alone
there so much, guarding a yard where nothing and nobody ever comes. He's just
remembering the trains that used to go in and out before the line was given
up.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

said Dick. 'But I don't see how we'd spot it, except by the noise it made,

in the daytime. We wouldn't see much, even if we were there.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>It was such an exciting subject to Jock
that he persisted in talking about it all the afternoon. Anne got tired of
listening, and went to sleep with Biddy's puppy in her arms. Timmy curled up by
George and went to sleep too. He wanted to go for a walk, but he could see that
there was no hope with all this talking going on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

had an exciting afternoon talking about all this. And look here, if you don't
make up your minds to go spook-train hunting I'll jolly well go off by myself.

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

There were slices of bread thickly spread with butter, and new-made cream
cheese to go with it. There was sticky brown gingerbread, hot from the oven,
and a big solid fruit cake that looked almost like a plum pudding when it was
cut, it was so black.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

up the rough track to the farmhouse, and Mrs Andrews looked up. 'That's Mr

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

bad-tempered, and stopped short when he saw the five children.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Hallo, dear,' said Mrs Andrews. 'Jock's

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

kind of smile, 'perhaps it would be best. I've had a worrying kind of day, and
not much to eat.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

that he seemed so small and looked rather stupid. She had imagined someone big

making a lot of money. Well, he must be cleverer than he looked, to make enough
money to give Mrs Andrews all she.needed for her farm.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Go on! You tell me all you know. And then
I'll tell you!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Julian decided to tell, very shortly, what
had happened at the old railway yard, and what Wooden-Leg Sam had said. He made
the tale sound rather bald and dull. Mr Andrews listened to it with the
greatest interest, never once taking his eyes off Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Then he sat back and drank a whole cup of
strong tea in one gulp. The children waited for him to speak, wondering what he
had to say.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Now,' he said, making his voice sound
important and impressive, 'you listen to me. Don't any of you ever go down to
that yard again. It's a bad place.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Why?' asked Julian. 'What do you mean - a
bad place?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Things have happened there - years and
years ago,' said Mr Andrews. 'Bad things. Accidents. It was all shut up after
that and the tunnel wasn't used any more. See? Nobody was allowed to go there,
and nobody did, because they were scared. They knew it was a bad place, where
bad things happen.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Anne felt frightened. 'But Mr Andrews - you
don't mean there really are spook-trains, do you?' she asked, her face rather
pale.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Mr Andrews pursed up his lips and nodded
very solemnly indeed. 'That's just what I do mean. Spook-trains come and go.
Nobody knows why. But it's bad luck to be there when they come. They might take
you away, see?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Julian laughed. 'Oh - not as bad as that,
sir, surely! Anyway, you're frightening Anne, so let's change the subject. I
don't believe in spook-trains.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>But Mr Andrews didn't seem to want to stop
talking about the trains. 'Wooden-Leg Sam was right to hide himself when they
come along,' he said. 'I don't know how he manages to stay on in a bad place
like that. Never knowing when a train is going to come creeping out of that
tunnel in the darkness.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Julian was not going to have Anne
frightened any more. He got up from the table and turned to Mrs Andrews.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Thank you very much for a lovely day and
lovely food!' he said. 'We must go now. Come along, Anne.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Wait a minute,' said Mr Andrews. 'I just
want to warn you all very solemnly that you mustn't go down to that railway
yard. You hear me, Jock? You might never come back. Old Wooden-Leg Sam's mad,
and well he may be, with spook-trains coming along in the dead of night. It's a
bad and dangerous place. You're not to go near it!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Well - thank you for the warning, sir,'
said Julian, politely, suddenly disliking the small man with the big nose very
much indeed. 'We'll be going. Goodbye, Mrs Andrews. Good-bye, Jock. Come along
tomorrow and have a picnic with us, will you?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Oh, thanks! Yes, I will,' said Jock. 'But
wait a minute - aren't you going to take any food with you?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Yes, of course they are,' said Mrs
Andrews, getting up from her chair. She had been listening to the<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>conversation with a look of puzzled wonder
on her face. She went out into the scullery, where there was a big, cold
larder. Julian followed her. He carried the two baskets.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Til give you plenty,' said Mrs Andrews,
putting loaves, butter, and cream cheese into the baskets. 'I know what
appetites you youngsters get. Now don't you be too scared at what my husband's
just been saying - I saw that little Anne was frightened. I've never heard of
the spook-trains, and I've been here for three years. I don't reckon there's
much in the tale, you know, for all my husband's so set on warning you not to
go down to the yard.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Julian said nothing. He thought that Mr
Andrews had behaved rather oddly about the whole story. Was he one of the kind
of people who believed in all sorts of silly things and got scared himself? He
looked weak enough! Julian found himself wondering how a nice woman like Mrs
Andrews could have married such a poor specimen of a man. Still, he was a
generous fellow, judging by all Jock had said, and perhaps Jock's mother felt
grateful to him for giving her the farm and the money to run it with. That must
be it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Julian thanked Mrs Andrews, and insisted on
paying her, though she would have given him the food for nothing. She came into
the kitchen with him and he saw that the others had already gone outside. Only
Mr Andrews was left, eating ham and pickles.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Good-bye, sir,' said Julian politely.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Good-bye. And you remember what I've told
you, boy,' said Mr Andrews. 'Bad luck comes to people who see the spook-trains
- yes, terrible bad luck. You keep away from them.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Julian gave a polite smile and went out. It
was evening now and the sun was setting behind the<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>moorland hills, though it still had a long
way to go before it disappeared. He caught up with the others. Jock was with
them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'I'm just coming half-way with you,' said
Jock. 'I say! My stepfather was pretty scary about those trains, wasn't he?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'I felt pretty scary too, when he was
warning us about them,' said Anne. 'I shan't go down to that yard again, ever.
Will you, George?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'If the boys did, I would,' said George,
who didn't look very much as if she wanted to, all the same.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Are you going to the yard again?' asked
Jock, eagerly. 'I'm not scared. Not a bit. It would be an adventure to go and
watch for a spook-train.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'We might go,' said Julian. 'We'll take you
with us, if we do. But the girls aren't to come.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Well, I like that!' said George angrily.
'As if you could leave me behind! When have I been scared of anything? I'm as
brave as any of you.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Yes. I know. You can come as soon as we
find out it's all a silly story,' said Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'I shall come whenever you go,' flashed
back George. 'Don't you dare to leave me out. I'll never speak to you again if
you do.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Jock looked most surprised at this sudden
flare-up of temper from George. He didn't know how fierce she could be!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'I don't see why George shouldn't come,' he
said. 'I bet she'd be every bit as good as a boy. I thought she was one when I
first saw her.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>George gave him one of her sweetest smiles.
He couldn't have said anything she liked better! But Julian would not change
his mind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'I mean what I say. The girls won't come if
we do go, so that's that. For one thing, Anne certainly<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>wouldn't want to come, and if George came
without her she'd be left all alone up at the camp. She wouldn't like that.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'She could have Mr Luffy's company,' said
George, looking sulky again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Idiot! As if we'd want to tell Mr'Luffy we
were going off exploring deserted railway yards watched over by a mad,
one-legged fellow who swears there are spook-trains!' said Julian. 'He'd stop
us going. You know what grown-ups are like. Or he'd come with us, which would
be worse.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Yes. He'd see moths all the time, not
spook-trains,' said Dick, with a grin.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'I'd better go back now,' said Jock. 'It's
been a grand day. I'll come up tomorrow and picnic with you. Good-bye.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>They called good-bye to Jock, and went on
their way to the camp. It was quite nice to see it again, waiting for them, the
two tents flapping a little in the breeze. Anne pushed her way through the
tent-flap, anxious to see that everything was untouched.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Inside the tent it was very hot. Anne
decided to put the food they had brought under the bottom of the big gorse
bush. It would be cooler there. She was soon busy about her little jobs. The
boys went down to see if Mr Luffy was back, but he wasn't.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Anne! We're going to bathe in the stream!'
they called. 'We feel hot and dirty. Are you coming? George is coming too.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'No, I won't come,' Anne called back. 'I've
got lots of things to do.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>The boys grinned at one another. Anne did
so enjoy 'playing house'. So they left her to it, and went to the stream, from
which yells and howls and shrieks soon came. The water was colder than they
expected, and<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>nobody liked to lie down in it - but
everyone was well and truly splashed, and the icy-cold drops falling on their
hot bodies made them squeal and yell. Timmy didn't in the least mind the
iciness of the water. He rolled over and over in it, enjoying himself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Look at him, showing off!' said Dick.
'Aha, Timmy, if I could bathe in a fur coat like you, I wouldn't mind the cold
water either.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Woof,' said Timmy, and climbed up the
shallow bank. He shook himself violently and thousands of icy-cold silvery
drops flew from him and landed on the three shivering children. They yelled and
chased him away.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>It was a pleasant, lazy evening. Mr Luffy
didn't appear at all. Anne got a light meal of bread and cream cheese and a
piece of gingerbread. Nobody felt like facing another big meal that day. They
lay in the heather and talked comfortably.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'This is the kind of holiday I like,' said
Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'So do I,' said Anne. 'Except for the
spook-trains. That's spoilt it a bit for me.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Don't be silly, Anne,' said George. 'If
they are not real it's just a silly story, and if they are real, well, it might
be an adventure.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>There was a little silence. 'Are we going
down to the yard again?' asked Dick lazily.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Yes, I think so,' said Julian. 'I'm not
going to be scared off it by weird warnings from Pa Andrews.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Then I vote we go one night and wait to
see if a spook-train does come along,' said Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'I shall come too,' said George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

with Anne.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>George said nothing, but everyone could
feel mutiny in the air.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Do we tell Mr Luffy, or don't we?' said
Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'You know we've said we wouldn't,' said
Julian. He yawned. 'I'm getting sleepy. And the sun has gone, so it will soon
be dark. I wonder where old Luffy is?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Do you think I'd better wait up and see if
he wants something to eat?' said Anne, anxiously.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'No. Not unless you want to keep awake till
midnight!' said Julian. 'He'll have got some food down in his tent. He'll be
all right. I'm going to turn in. Coming, Dick?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>The boys were soon in their sleeping-bags.
The girls lay in the heather for a little while longer, listening to the
lonely-sounding cry of the curlews going home in the dusk. Then they, too, went
into their own tent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Once safely in their sleeping-bags, the two
boys felt suddenly wide awake. They began to talk in low voices.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Shall we take Jock down to see the yard in
the daytime? Or shall we go one night and watch for the Train from Nowhere?'
said Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'I vote we go and watch at night,' said
Dick. 'We'll never see a spook-train in the daytime. Wooden-Leg Sam is an
interesting old chap, especially when he chucks cinders about - but I don't
know that I like him enough to go and visit him again!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Well - if Jock badly wants to go and have
a snoop round tomorrow morning when he comes, we'd better take him,' said
Julian. 'We can always go one night, too, if we want to.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Right. We'll wait and see what Jock says,'
said Dick. They talked a little longer and then felt sleepy. Dick was just
dropping off when he heard something coming wriggling through the heather. A
head was stuck through the opening of the tent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'If you dare to come in, I'll smack your

what you want, you perfect pest - you want to flop down on my tummy. You just
turn yourself round and go away! Do you hear?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>The head in the opening moved a little but
didn't go away. Dick raised himself up on one elbow.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

I'm not fond of you at night - not when I'm in a sleeping-bag anyway. Scoot!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>The head made a peculiar apologetic sound.
Then it spoke. 'Er - you're awake, I see. Are all of you all right - the girls

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

come to flop himself down on top of me, like he often does. So sorry, sir.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

and nobody liked to disturb him. The girls yelled with laughter when they heard
how Dick had spoken to him the night before, thinking he was Timmy the dog.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'He was very decent about it,' said Dick.
'Seemed to think it was quite amusing. I hope he'll still think so this morning!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>They were all sitting eating their
breakfast - ham, tomatoes, and the bread Mrs Andrews had given them the day
before. Timmy collected the bits as usual, and wondered if George would let him
have a lick of the cream cheese she was now putting on her bread. Timmy loved
cheese. He looked at the lump in the dish and sighed all over George. He could
easily eat that in one mouthful! How he wished he could.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

the moors, and picnic somewhere. Jock ought to know some fine walks.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

right out of my fingers!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

him.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Well, he §han't have any more. It's too
precious,' said Anne. 'Oh, dear -1 wish we didn't eat so much. We keep bringing
in stacks of food, and it hardly lasts any time.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

Dick. 'He's a sensible sort of fellow. Did you get a peep into that enormous
larder of his mother's? It's like a great cave, goes right back into the wall,
with dozens of stone shelves - and all filled with food. No wonder Jock's
tubby.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

firmly. 'You go down and see if Mr Luffy is awake. He can have a bit of ham and
a few tomatoes, if he likes.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>They went down to Mr Luffy's tent. He was
awake, sitting at the entrance, eating some kind of breakfast. He waved a
sandwich at them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

didn't. I wasn't asleep,' said Dick, going rather red. 'Did you have a good

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Bit disappointing. Didn't find quite all
the creatures I'd hoped,' said Mr Luffy. 'What about you? Did you have a good
day?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Fine,' said Dick, and described it. Mr
Luffy seemed very interested in everything, even in Mr Andrews's rather
frightening warning about the railway yard.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Silly chap he sounds,' said Mr Luffy,
shaking the crumbs off his front. 'All the same - I should keep away from the yard,
if I were you. Stories don't get<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

without fire!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Why, sir - surely you don't believe
there's anything spooky about the trains there?' said Dick, in surprise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Oh, no - I doubt if there are any trains,'
said Mr Luffy. 'But when a place has got a bad name it's usually best to keep
away from it.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'I suppose so, sir,' said Dick and Julian
together. Then they hastily changed the subject, afraid that Mr Luffy, like Mr
Andrews, might also be going to forbid them to visit the railway yard. And the
more they were warned about it and forbidden to go, the more they felt that
they really must!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Well, we must get back,' said Dick. 'We're
expecting Jock - that's the boy at the farm - to come up for the day, and we
thought we'd go out walking and take our food with us. Are you going out, too,
sir?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Not today,' said Mr Luffy. 'My legs are
tired and stiff with so much scrambling about yesterday, and I want to mount
some of the specimens I found. Also I'd like to meet your farm friend - what's
his name -Jock?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Yes, sir,' said Julian. 'Right. We'll
bring him along as soon as he comes, then off we'll go. You'll be left in peace
all day!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>But Jock didn't come. The children waited
for him all the morning and he didn't turn up. They held up their lunch until
they were too hungry to wait any longer, and then they had it on the heather in
front of their tents.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Funny,' said Julian. 'He knows where the
camp is, because we pointed it out to him when he came half-way home with us
yesterday. Perhaps he'll come this afternoon.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>But he didn't come in the afternoon either,
nor did<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>he come after tea. Julian debated whether
or not to go and see what was up, but decided against it. There must be some
good reason why Jock hadn't come, and Mrs Andrews wouldn't want them all
visiting her two days running.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>It was a disappointing day. They didn't
like to leave the tents and go for even a short stroll in case Jock came. Mr
Luffy was busy all day long with his specimens. He was sorry Jock had
disappointed them. 'He'll come tomorrow,' he said. 'Have you got enough food?
There's some in that tin over there if you want it.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Oh, no, thank you, sir,' said Julian.
'We've plenty really. We're going to have a game of cards. Like to join us?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Yes, I think I will,' said Mr Luffy,
getting up and stretching himself. 'Can you play rummy?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>They could - and they beat poor Mr Luffy
handsomely, because he couldn't play at all. He blamed his luck on his bad
cards, but he enjoyed the game immensely. He said the only thing that really
put him off was the way that Timmy stood behind him and breathed down his neck
all the time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'I kept feeling certain that Timmy thought
he knew how to play my cards better than I could,' he complained. 'And whenever
I did something wrong, he breathed down my neck harder than usual.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Everyone laughed, and George privately
thought that Timmy would probably play very much better than Mr Luffy if only
he could hold the cards.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Jock didn't come at all. They put the cards
away when they could no longer see them, and Mr Luffy announced that he was
going to bed. 'It was very late when I got back last night,' he said. 'I really
must have an early night.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>The others thought they would go to bed
too. The thought of their cosy sleeping-bags was always a nice one when
darkness came on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>The,girls crept into their bags and Timmy
flopped down on George. The boys were in their bags about the same time and
Dick gave a loud yawn.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Good night, Ju,' he said, and fell fast
asleep. Julian was soon asleep too. In fact, everyone was sound asleep when
Timmy gave a little growl. It was such a small growl that neither of the girls
heard it, and certainly Dick and Julian didn't, away in their tent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Timmy raised his head and listened
intently. Then he gave another small growl. He listened again. Finally he got
up, shook himself, still without waking George, and stalked out of the tent,
his ears cocked and his tail up. He had heard somebody or something, and
although he thought it was all right, he was going to make sure.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Dick was sound asleep when he felt
something brushing against the outside of his tent. He awoke at once and sat
up. He looked at the tent opening. A shadow appeared there and looked in.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Was it Timmy? Was it Mr Luffy? He mustn't
make a mistake this time. He waited for the shadow to speak. But it didn't! It
just stayed there as if it were listening for some movement inside the tent.
Dick didn't like it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Timmy!' he said at last, in a low voice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Then the shadow spoke: 'Dick? Or is it
Julian? It's Jock here. I've got Timmy beside me. Can I come in?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Jockl' said Dick, in surprise. 'Whatever
have you come at this time of night for? And why didn't you come today? We
waited ages for you.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Yes. I know I'm awfully sorry,' said
Jock's voice, and the boy wriggled himself into the tent. Dick poked Julian
awake.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Julian! Here's Jock - and Timmy. Get off
me, Timmy. Here, Jock, see if you can squeeze inside my sleeping-bag - there's
room for us both, I think.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Oh, thanks,' said Jock, and squeezed
inside with difficulty. 'How warm it is! I say, I'm terribly sorry I didn't
come today - but my stepfather suddenly announced he wanted me to go somewhere
with him for the whole day. Can't think why. He doesn't bother about me as a
rule.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'That was mean of him, seeing that he knew
you were to come on a picnic with us,' said Julian. 'Was it something
important?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'No. Not at all,' said Jock. 'He drove off
to Endersfield - that's about forty miles away - parked me in the public
library there, saying he'd be back in a few minutes - and he didn't come back
till past tea-time! I had some sandwiches with me, luckily. I felt pretty angry
about it, I can tell you.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Never mind. Come tomorrow instead,' said
Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'I can't,' said Jock in despair. 'He's gone
and arranged for me to meet the son of some friend of his-a boy called Cecil
Dearlove - what a name! I'm to spend the day with this frightful boy. The worst
of it is Mum's quite pleased about it. She never thinks my stepfather takes
enough notice of me - good thing he doesn't, /think.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Oh blow - so you won't be able to come
tomorrow either,' said Julian. 'Well - what about the next day?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'It should be all right,' said Jock. 'But
I've feeling I'll have dear love of a Cecil plonked on me for the day - to show
him the cows and the puppies, dear pet! Ugh! When I could be with you four and
Timmy.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'It's bad luck,' said Julian. 'It really
is.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'I thought I'd better come and tell you,'
said Jock. 'It's the first chance I've had, creeping up here tonight.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>I've brought some more food for you, by the
way. I guessed you'd want some. I feel down in the dumps about that adventure -
you know, going to see the railway yard. I was going to ask you to take me
today.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Well - if you can't come tomorrow either -
and perhaps not the next day - what about going one night?' said Dick. 'Would
you like to come up tomorrow night, about this time? We won't tell the girls.
We'll just go off by ourselves, we three boys - and watch!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Jock was too thrilled to say a word. He let
out a deep breath of joy. Dick laughed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Don't get too thrilled. We probably shan't
see a thing. Bring a torch if you've got one. Come to our tent and jerk my toe.
I'll probably be awake, but if I'm not, that'll wake me all right! And don't
say a word to anyone of course.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Rather not, 'said Jock, overjoyed. 'Well
-1 suppose I'd better be going. It was pretty weird coming over the moorland in
the dark. There's no moon, and the stars don't give much light. I've left the
food outside the tent. Better look out that Timmy doesn't get it.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Right. Thanks awfully,' said Julian. Jock
got out of Dick's sleeping-bag and went backwards out of the tent, with Timmy
obligingly licking his nose all the way. Jock then found the bag of food and
rolled it in to Julian, who put it safely under the groundsheet.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Good night,' said Jock, in a low voice,
and they heard him scrambling over the heather. Timmy went with him, pleased at
this unexpected visitor, and the chance of a midnight walk. Jock was glad to
have the dog's company. Timmy went right to the farm with him and then bounded
back over the moorland to the camping-place, longing to pounce on the rabbits
he<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

get back to George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>In the morning Anne was amazed to find the
food in her 'larder' under the gorse bush. Julian had popped it there to
surprise her. 'Look at this!' she cried, in astonishment. 'Meat-pies - more
tomatoes - eggs, wherever did they come from?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Volcano shot them up into the air,' said
Mr Luffy, who was also there. Anne threw a tea-cloth at him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Tell me how it came here,' she demanded.
'I was worried about what to give you all for breakfast - and now there's more
than we can possibly eat. Who put it there? George, do you know?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

smiling faces of the two boys. 'I bet Jock was here last night,' she said to
them. 'Wasn't he?' And to herself she said: 'Yes - and somehow I think they've
planned something together. You won't trick me, Dick and Julian. I'll be on the
lookout from now on! Wherever you go, I go too!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>That day passed pleasantly enough. The
children, Timmy, and Mr Luffy all went off to a pool high up on the moorlands.
It was called The Green Pool' because of its cucumber-green colour. Mr Luffy
explained that some curious chemicals found there caused the water to look
green.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'I hope we shan't come out looking green,
too,' said Dick, getting into his bathing trunks. 'Are you going to bathe, Mr
Luffy?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Mr Luffy was. The children expected him to
be a very poor swimmer and to splash about at the edge and do very little- but
to their surprise he was magnificent in the water, and could swim faster even
than Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>They had great fun, and when they were
tired they came out to bask in the sun. The highroad ran alongside the green
pool, and the children watched a herd of sheep being driven along, then a car
or two came by, and finally a big army lorry. A boy sat beside the driver, and
to the children's surprise he waved wildly at them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Who was that?' said Julian astonished.
'Surely he doesn't know us?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>George's sharp eye had seen who it was. 'It
was Jock! Sitting beside the driver. And, look, here comes his stepfather's
fine new car. Jock's preferred to go with the lorry-driver instead of his
stepfather! I don't blame him, either!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>The bright new car came by, driven by Mr
Andrews. He didn't glance at the children by the wayside, but drove steadily on
after the lorry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Going to market, I suppose,' said Dick,
lying back again. 'Wonder what they're taking?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'So do I,' said Mr Luffy. 'He must sell his
farm produce at very high prices to be able to buy that fine car and all the
machinery and gear you've told me about. Clever fellow, Mr Andrews!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'He doesn't look at all clever,' said Anne.
'He looks rather a weak, feeble sort of man, really, Mr Luffy. I can't even
imagine him being clever enough to beat anyone down, or get the better of
them.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Very interesting,' said Mr Luffy. 'Well,
what about another dip before we have our dinner?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>It was a very nice day, and Mr Luffy was
very good company. He could make fine jokes very solemnly indeed, and only the
fact that his ear waggled violently showed the others that he too, was enjoying
the joke. His right ear seemed to love to join in the joke, even if Mr Luffy's
face was as solemn as Timmy's.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>They arrived home at the camp about
tea-time and Anne got a fine tea ready. They took it down to eat in front of Mr
Luffy's tent. As the evening came on Julian and Dick felt excitement rising in
them. In the daytime neither of them really believed a word about the
'spook-trains', but as the sun sank and long shadows crept down the hills they
felt pleasantly thrilled. Would they really see anything exciting that night?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>It was a very dark night at first, because
clouds lay across the sky and hid even the stars. The boys said good night to
the girls and snuggled down into their sleeping-bags. They watched the sky
through the tent opening.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Gradually the big clouds thinned out. A few
stars<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>appeared. The clouds thinned still more and
fled away in rags. Soon the whole sky was bright with pin-points of light, and
a hundred thousand stars looked down on the moorlands.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'We shall have a bit of starlight to see
by,' whispered Julian. 'That's good. I don't want to stumble about over the
heather and break my ankle in rabbit-holes in the pitch darkness. Nor do I want
to use my torch on the way to the yard in case it's seen.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'It's going to be fun!' Dick whispered
back. 'I hope Jock comes. It will be maddening if he doesn't.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>He did come. There was a scrambling over
the heather and once again a shadow appeared at the tent opening.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Julian! Dick! I've come. Are you ready?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>It was Jock's voice, of course. Dick's
thumb pressed the switch of his torch and for a moment its light fell on Jock's
red, excited face, and then was switched off again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Hallo, Jock! So you were able to come,'
said Dick. 'I say, was that you in the lorry this morning, going by the green
pool?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Yes. Did you see me? I saw you and waved
like mad,' said Jock. 'I wanted to stop the lorry and get down and speak to
you, but the driver's an awful bad-tempered sort of fellow. He wouldn't hear of
stopping. Said my stepfather would be wild with him if he did. Did you see him
- my stepfather, I mean? He was in his car behind.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Were you off to market or something?'
asked Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'I expect that's where the lorry was
going,' said Jock. 'It was empty, so I suppose my stepfather was going to pick
up something there. I came back in the car. The lorry was supposed to come
later.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'How did you like Cecil Dearlove?' asked
Dick, grinning in the darkness.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Awful! Worse than his name,' groaned Jock.
'Wanted me to play soldiers all the time! The frightful thing is I've got to
have him at the farm for the day tomorrow. Another day wasted. What shall I do
with him?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Roll him in the pig-sty,' suggested Dick.
'Or put him with Biddy's puppies and let him sleep there. Tell him to play
soldiers with them.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Jock chuckled. 'I wish I could. The worst
of it is Mum is awfully pleased that my stepfather's got this Cecil boy for me
to be friends with. Don't let's talk about it. Are you ready to start off?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Yes,' said Julian, and began to scramble
quietly out of his bag. 'We didn't tell the girls. Anne doesn't want to come,
and I don't want George to leave Anne by herself. Now, let's be very, very
quiet till we're out of hearing.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Dick got out of his bag too. The boys had
not undressed that night, except for their coats, so all they had to do was to
slip these on, and then crawl out of the tent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Which is the way - over there?' whispered
Jock. Julian took his arm and guided him. He hoped he wouldn't lose his way in
the starlit darkness. The moorland look so different at night!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'If we make for that hill you can dimly see
over there against the starlit sky, we should be going in the right direction,'
said Julian. So on they went, keeping towards the dark hill that rose up to the
west.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>It seemed very much farther to the railway
yard at night than in the daytime. The three boys stumbled along, sometimes
almost falling as their feet caught in tufts of heather. They were glad when
they found<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>some sort of path they could keep on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'This is about where we met the shepherd,'
said Dick, in a low voice. He didn't know why he spoke so quietly. He just felt
as if he must. 'I'm sure we can't be very far off now.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'[Tiey went on for some way, and then
Julian pulled Dick by the arm. 'Look,' he said. 'Down there, I believe that's
the old yard. You can see the line* gleaming faintly here and there.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>They stood on the heathery slope above the
old yard, straining their eyes. Soon they could make out dim shapes. Yes, it
was the railway yard all right.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Jock clutched Julian's sleeve. 'Look -
there's a light down there! Do you see it?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>The boys looked - and, sure enough, down in
the yard towards the other side of it, was a small yellow light. They stared at
it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Oh - I think I know what it is,' said
Dick, at last. 'It's the light in the watchman's little hut - old Wooden-Leg
Sam's candle. Don't you think so, Ju?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Yes. You're right,' said Julian. 'I tell
you what we'll do - we'll creep right down into the yard, and go over to the
hut. We'll peep inside and see if old Sam is there. Then we'll hide somewhere
about and wait for the spook-train to come!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>They crept down the slope. Their eyes had
got used to the starlight by now, and they were beginning to see fairly well.
They got right down to the yard, where their feet made a noise on some cinders
there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>They stopped. 'Someone will hear us if we
make a row like this,' whispered Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Who will?' whispered back Dick. 'There's
no one here except old Sam in his hut!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'How do you know there isn't?' said Julian.
'Good heavens, Jock, don't make such a row with your feet!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>They stood there, debating what was the
best thing to do. 'We'd better walk right round the edge of the yard,' said
Julian at last. 'As far as I remember, the grass has grown there. We'll walk on
that.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>So they made their way to the edge of the
yard. Sure enough, there was grass there, and they walked on it without a
sound. They went slowly and softly to where the light shone dimly in Sam's
little hut.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>The window was high and small. It was just
about at the level of their heads, and the three boys cautiously eased
themselves along to it and looked in.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Wooden-Leg Sam was there. He sat sprawled
in a chair, smoking a pipe. He was reading a newspaper, squinting painfully as
he did so. He obviously had not had his broken glasses mended yet. On a chair
beside him was his wooden leg. He had unstrapped it, and there it lay.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'He's not expecting the spook-train
tonight, or he wouldn't have taken off his wooden leg,' whispered Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>The candlelight flickered and shadows
jumped about the tiny hut. It was a poor, ill-furnished little place, dirty and
untidy. A cup without saucer or handle stood on the table, and a tin kettle
boiled on a rusty stove.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Sam put down his paper and rubbed his eyes.
He muttered something. The boys could not hear it, but they felt certain it was
something about his broken glasses.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Are there many lines in this yard?'
whispered Jock, tired of looking in at old Sam. 'Where do they go to?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'About half a mile or so up there is a
tunnel,' said Julian, pointing past Jock. 'The lines come from there and run
here, where they break up in many pairs - for<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>shunting and so on, in the old days, I
suppose, when this place was used.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Let's go up the lines to the tunnel,' said
Jock. 'Come on. There's nothing to be seen here. Let's walk up to the tunnel.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'All right,' said Julian. 'We may as well.
I don't expect we'll see much up there either! I think these spook-trains are
all a tall story of old Sam's!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>They left the little hut with its forlorn
candlelight, and made their way round the yard again. Then they followed the
single-track line away from the yard and up towards the tunnel. It didn't seem
to matter walking on cinders now, and making a noise. They walked along,
talking in low voices.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>And then things began to happen! A far-off
muffled noise came rumbling out of the tunnel, which was now so near that the
boys could see its black mouth. Julian heard it first. He stood still and
clutched Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'I say! Listen! Can you hear that?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>The others listened. 'Yes,' said Dick. 'But
it's only a train going through one of the underground tunnels -the noise is
echoing out through this one.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'It isn't. That noise is made by a train
coming through this tunnel'' said Julian. The noise grew louder and louder. A
clanking made itself heard too. The boys stepped off the lines and crouched
together by the side, waiting, hardly daring to breathe.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Could it be the spook-train? They watched
for the light of an engine-lamp to appear like a fiery eye in the tunnel. But
none came. It was darker than night in there! But the noise came nearer and
nearer and nearer. Could there be the, noise of a train without a train?
Julian's heart began to beat twice as fast, and Dick and Jock found themselves
clutching one another without knowing it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>The noise grew thunderous, and then out
from the tunnel came something long and black, with a dull glow in front that
passed quickly and was gone. The noise deafened the boys, and then the clanking
and rumbling grew less as the train, or whatever it was, passed by. The ground
trembled and then was still.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Well, there you are,' said Julian, in a
rather trembly voice. 'The spook-train - without a light or a signal! Where's
it gone? To the yard, do you think?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Shall we go and see?' asked Dick. 'I
didn't see anyone in the cab, even in the glow of what must have been the fire
there - but there must be someone driving it! I say, what a weird thing, isn't
it? It sounded real enough, anyway.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'We'll go to the yard,' said Jock, who, of
the three, seemed the least affected. 'Come on.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>They made their way very slowly - and then
Dick gave a sharp cry. 'Blow! I've twisted my ankle. Haifa minute!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>He sank down to the ground in great pain.
It was only a sharp twist, not a sprain, but for a few minutes Dick could, do
nothing but groan. The others dared not /eave him. /u/ian knelt by him,
offering to rub the ankle, but Dick wouldn't let him touch it. Jock stood by
anxiously.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>It took about twenty minutes for Dick's
ankle to be strong enough for him to stand on again. With the help of the
others he got to his feet and tested his ankle. 'It's all right, I think. I can
walk on it - slowly. Now we'll go to the yard and see what's happening!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>But even as they started to walk slowly
back, they heard a noise coming up the lines from the far-away yard, 'Rumble,
rumble, rumble, jangle, clank!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'It's coming back again!' said Julian.
'Stand still. Watch! It'll be going back into the tunnel!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>They stood still and watched and listened.
Again the noise came nearer and grew thunderous. They saw the glow of what
might be the fire in the cab, and then it passed. The train disappeared into
the blackness of the tunnel mouth and they heard the echo of its rumblings for
some time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Well, there you are! There is a
spook-train!' said Julian, trying to laugh, though he felt a good deal shaken.
'It came and it went - where from or where to, nobody knows! But we've heard it
and seen it, in the darkness of the night. And jolly creepy it was, too!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>The three boys stood rather close together,
glad to feel each other in the darkness. They couldn't believe that they had
found what they had come looking for so doubtfully! What kind of a train was
this that had come rumbling out of the tunnel so mysteriously, and then, after
a pause at the yard, had gone just as mysteriously back again?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'If only I hadn't twisted my ankle, we
could have followed the train down the lines to the yard, and have gone quite
close to it there,' groaned Dick. 'What an ass I am, messing things up at the
most exciting moment!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'You couldn't help it,' said Jock. 'I say\
We've seen the spook-train! I can hardly believe it. Does it go all by itself,
with nobody to drive it? Is it a real train?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Judging by the noise it made, it's real
all right,' said Julian. 'And it shot out smoke, too. All the same, it's jolly
strange. I can't say I like it much.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Let's go and see what's happened to
Wooden-Leg Sam,' said Dick. 'I bet he's under his bed!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>They made their way slowly back to the
yard, Dick limping a little, though his ankle was practically all right again.
When they came to the yard they looked towards Sam's hut. The light was there
no longer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'He's blown it out and got under the bed!'
said Dick. 'Poor Sam! It really must be terrifying for him. Let's go and peep
into his hut.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>They went over to it and tried to see in at
the window. But there was nothing to be seen. The hut was in complete darkness.
Then suddenly a little flare flashed out somewhere near the floor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Look - there's Sam! He's lighting a
match,' said Julian. 'See - he's peeping out from under the bed. He looks
scared stiff. Let's tap on the window and ask him if he's all right.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>But that was quite the wrong thing to do!
As soon as Julian tapped sharply on the window, Sam gave an anguished yell and
retired hurriedly under the bed again, his wavering match-light going out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'It's come for to take me!' they heard him
wailing. 'It's come for to take me! And me with my wooden leg off too.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'We're only frightening the poor old
fellow,' said Dick. 'Come on. Let's leave him. He'll have a fit or something if
we call out to him. He honestly thinks the spook-train's come to get him.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>They wandered round the dark yard for a few
minutes, but there was nothing to find out in the darkness. No more rumbling
came to their ears. The spook-train was evidently not going to run again that
night.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Let's go back,' said Julian. 'That really
was exciting! Honestly, my hair stood on end when that train came puffing out
of the tunnel. Where on earth did it come from? And what's the reason for it?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>They gave it up, and began to walk back to
the camp. The'y scrambled through the heather, tired but excited. 'Shall we
tell the girls we've seen the train?' said Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'No,' said Julian. 'It would only scare
Anne, and George would be furious if she knew we'd gone without her. We'll wait
and see if we discover any-<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

tongue, too, won't you, Jock?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Course,' said Jock, scornfully. 'Who would
I tell? My stepfather? Not likely! How furious he'd be if he knew we'd all
pooh-poohed his warnings and gone down to see the spook-train after all!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>He suddenly felt something warm against his
legs, and gave a startled cry: 'What's this? Get away!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>But the warm thing turned out to be Timmy,
who had come to meet the three boys. He pressed against each of them in turn
and whined a little.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'He says, &quot;Why didn't you take me with
you?&quot;' said Dick. 'Sorry, old thing, but we couldn't. George would never
have spoken to us again if we'd taken you, and left her behind! How would you
have liked spook-trains, Timmy? Would you have run into a corner somewhere and
hidden?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>'Woof,' said Timmy, scornfully. As if he would
be afraid of anything!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>They reached their camping-place and began
to speak in whispers. 'Good-bye, Jock. Come up tomorrow if you can. Hope you
don't have that Cecil boy to cope with!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Good-bye! See you soon,' whispered Jock,
and disappeared into the darkness, with Timmy at his heels. Another chance of a
midnight walk? Good, thought Timmy, just what he'd like! It was hot in the
tent, and a scamper in the cool night air would be fine.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Timmy growled softly when they came near to
Olly's Farm, and stood still, the hackles on his neck rising up a little. Jock
put his hand on the dog's head and stopped.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'What's the matter, old boy? Burglars or
something?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>He strained his eyes in the darkness. Big
clouds now covered the stars and there was no light at all to see by. Jock made
out a dim light in one of the barns. He crept over to it to see what it was. It
went&quot; out as he came near, and then he heard the sound of footsteps, the
quiet closing of the barn door, and the click of a padlock as it was locked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Jock crept nearer - too near, for whoever
it was must have heard him and swung round, lashing out with his arm. He caught
Jock on the shoulder, and the boy overbalanced. He almost fell, and the man who
had struck him clutched hold of him. A flash-light was put on and he blinked in
the sudden light.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'It's you, Jock!' said an astonished voice,
rough and impatient. 'What are you doing out here at this time of night?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Well, what are you doing?' demanded Jock,
wriggling free. He switched on his own torch and let the light fall on the man
who had caught him. It was Peters, one of the farm men, the one in whose lorry
he had ridden that very day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'What's it to do with you?' said Peters, angrily.
'I had a breakdown, and I've only just got back. Look here - you're fully
dressed! Where have you been at this time of night? Did you hear me come in and
get up to see what was happening?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'You never know!' said Jock cheekily. He
wasn't going to say anything that might make Peters suspicious of him. 'You
just never know!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Is that Biddy?' said Peters, seeing a dark
shadow slinking away. 'Do you mean to say you've been out with Biddy? What in
the world have you been doing?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Jock thanked his lucky stars that Peters
hadn't<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>spotted it was Timmy, not Biddy. He moved
off without saying another word. Let Peters think what he liked! It was bad
luck, though, that Peters had had a breakdown and come in late. If the man told
his stepfather he'd seen Jock, fully dressed in the middle of the night,
there'd be questions asked by both his mother and his stepfather, and Jock, who
was a truthful boy, would find things very difficult to explain.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>He scuttled off to bed, climbing up the
pear-tree outside his window, and dropping quietly into his room. He opened his
door softly to hear if anyone was awake in the house, but all was dark and
silent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Blow Peters!' thought Jock. 'If he splits
on me, I'm for it!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>He got into bed, pondered over the curious
happenings of the night for a few minutes, and then slid into an uneasy sleep,
in which spook-trains, Peters, and Timmy kept doing most peculiar things. He
was glad to awake in the bright, sunny morning and find his mother shaking him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Get up, Jock! You're very late. Whatever's
made you so sleepy? We're half-way through breakfast!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Peters, apparently, didn't say anything to
Jock's stepfather about seeing Jock in the night. Jock was very thankful. He
began to plan how to slip off to the others at the camp. He'd take them some
food! That would be a fine excuse.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Mum, can I take a basket of stuff to the
campers?' he said, after breakfast. They must be running short now.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Well, that boy is coming,' said his
mother. 'What's his name - Cecil something? Your stepfather says he's such a
nice boy. You did enjoy your day with him yesterday, didn't you?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Jock would have said quite a lot of
uncomplimentary things about dear Cecil if his stepfather had not been there,
sitting by the window reading the paper. As it was, he shrugged his shoulders
and made a face, hoping that his mother would understand his feelings. She did.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'What time is Cecil coming?' she said.
'Perhaps there's time for you to run to the camp with a basket.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'I don't want him running off up there,'
said Mr Andrews, suddenly butting into the conversation, and putting down his
newspaper. 'Cecil may be here at any minute- and I know what Jock is! He'd
start talking to those kids and forget all about coming back. Cecil's father is
a great friend of mine, and Jock's got to be polite to him, and be here to
welcome him. There's to be no running off to that camp today.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Jock looked sulky. Why must his stepfather
suddenly interfere in his plans like this? Rushing him off to the town, making
him take Cecil for a friend! Just when some other children had come into his
rather lonely life and livened it up, too! It was maddening.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Perhaps I can go up to the camp myself
with some food,' said his mother, comfortingly. 'Or maybe the children will
come down for some.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Jock was still sulky. He stalked out into
the yard and went to look for Biddy. She was with her pups who were now trying
to crawl round the shed after her. Jock hoped the campers would come to fetch
food themselves that day. Then at least he would get a word with them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Cecil arrived by car. He was about the same
age as Jock, though he was small for twelve years old. He had curly hair which
was too long, and his grey flannel suit was very, very clean and well-pressed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Hallo!' he called to Jock. 'I've come.
What shall we play at? Soldiers?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'No. Red Indians,' said Jock, who had
suddenly remembered his old Red Indian head-dress with masses of feathers round
it, and a trail of them falling down the back. He rushed indoors, grinning. He
changed into the whole suit, and put on his head-dress. He took his paint-box
and hurriedly painted a frightful pattern of red, blue and green on his face.
He found his tomahawk and went downstairs. He would play at Red Indians, and
scalp that annoying Pale-Face!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Cecil was wandering round by himself. To
his enormous horror, as he turned a corner, a most terrifying figure rose up
from behind a wall, gave a horrible yell and pounced on him, waving what looked
like a dangerous chopper.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Cecil turned and fled, howling loudly, with
Jock leaping madly after him, whooping for all he was worth, and thoroughly
enjoying himself. He had had to play at soldiers all the day before with dear
Cecil. He didn't see why Cecil shouldn't play Red Indians all day with him
today!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Just at that moment, the four campers
arrived to fetch food, with Timmy running beside them. They stopped in
amazement at the sight of Cecil running like the wind, howling dismally, and a
fully-dressed and painted Red Indian leaping fiercely after him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Jock saw them, did a comical war-dance all
round them, much to Timmy's amazement, yelled dramatically, pretended to cut
off Timmy's tail and then tore after the vanishing Cecil.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>The children began to laugh helplessly. 'Oh
dear!' said Anne, with tears of laughter in her eyes, 'that must be Cecil he's
after. I suppose this is Jock's revenge for having to play soldiers all day
with him yesterday.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Look, there they go round the pig-sty. Poor
Cecil. He really thinks he's going to be scalped!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Cecil disappeared into the farm kitchen,
sobbing, and Mrs Andrews ran to comfort him. Jock made off back to the others,
grinning all over his war-painted face.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Hallo,' he said. 'I'm just having a nice
quiet time with dear Cecil. I'm so glad to see you. I wanted to come over, but
my stepfather said I wasn't to -1 must play with Cecil. Isn't he frightful?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Awful,' everyone agreed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'I say, will your mother be furious with
you for frightening Cecil like that? Perhaps we'd better not ask her for any
food yet?' said Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Yes, you'd better wait a bit,' said Jock,
leading them to the sunny side of the haystack they had rested by before.
'Hallo, Timmy! Did you get back all right last night?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Jock had completely forgotten that the
girls didn't know of the happenings of the night before. Both Anne and George
at once pricked up their ears. Julian frowned at Jock, and Dick gave him a
secret nudge.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'What's up?' said George, seeing all this
by-play. 'What happened last night?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Oh, I just came up to have a little
night-talk with the boys - and Timmy walked back with me,' said Jock, airily.
'Hope you didn't mind him coming, George.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>George flushed an angry red. 'You're keeping
something from me,' she said to the boys. 'Yes, you are. I know you are. I
believe you went off to the railway yard last night! Did you?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>There was an awkward silence. Julian shot
an annoyed look at poor Jock, who could have kicked himself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>on her forehead. 'You beasts! You did go!
And you never woke me up to go with you! Oh, I do think you're mean!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Did you see anything?' said Anne, her eyes
going from one boy to another. Each of the girls sensed that there had been
some kind of adventure in the night.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Well,' began Julian. And then there was an
interruption. Cecil came round the haystack, his eyes red with crying. He
glared at Jock.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Your father wants you,' he said. 'You're
to go at once. You're a beast, and I want to go home. Can't you hear your

whacks you hard!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

down by the others.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'If I didn't know my manners, I'd smack

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>The four sat in silence. They were sorry
for Jock. George was angry and sulky because she knew the others had gone off
without her the night before. Anne was worried. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>They all sat there for about ten minutes.
Then round the haystack came Jock's mother, looking distressed. She carried a
big basket of food.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>The children all stood up politely. 'Good

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'I'm sorry I can't ask you to stop today,'
said Mrs Andrews. 'But Jock has really behaved very foolishly. I wouldn't let
Mr Andrews give him a hiding because it would only make Jock hate his
stepfather, and that would never do. So I've sent him up to bed for the day.
You won't be able to see him, I'm afraid. Here is some<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

very sorry about all this. I can't think what came over Jock to behave in such
a way. It's not a bit like him.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Cecil's face appeared round the haystack,
looking rather smug. Julian grinned to himself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Would you like us to take Cecil for a nice
long walk over the moors?' he said. 'We can climb hills and jump over streams

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Cecil's face immediately disappeared.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

would be very kind of you. Now that Jock's been sent upstairs for the day
there's no one for Cecil to play with. But I'm afraid he's a bit of a mother's
boy, you know. You'll have to go carefully with him. Cecil! Cecil! Where are
you? Come and make friends with these children.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>But Cecil had gone. There was no answer at
all. He didn't want to make friends with 'these children'. He knew better than

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Mrs Andrews came back again, out of breath.
'I can't find him,' she said. 'Never mind. I'll find something for him to do
when he appears again.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Yes. Perhaps you've got some beads for him

others giggled. A smile appeared on Mrs Andrews's face.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Bad boy!' she said. 'Oh dear - poor Jock.

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>the haystack. Mr Andrews was getting into
his car. He would soon be gone. They waited a few minutes till they heard the
car set off down the rough cart-track.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>That's Jock's bedroom - where the pear-tree

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>They went across the farmyard and stood
under the pear-tree - all except George, who stayed behind the haystack with
the food, frowning. Julian called up to the window above: 'Jock!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>A head came out, the face still painted
terrifyingly in streaks and circles. 'Hallo! He didn't whack me. Mum wouldn't
let him. All the same, I'd rather he had - it's awful being stuck up here this
sunny day. Where's dear Cecil?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'I don't know. Probably in the darkest
corner of one of the barns,' said Julian. 'Jock, if things are difficult in the
daytime, come up at night. We've got to see you somehow.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

'We shall have an awful day with her now. You let the cat properly out of the

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'No. But that's no reason why he shouldn't
beware of one,' grinned Jock. 'So long! Have a nice day!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>The three left him, and strolled over to
Cecil, who had just appeared out of a dark little shed. He made a<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

dairy where Mrs Andrews was busy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Julian suddenly clutched Dick and pointed
behind Cecil. The bull! Beware of the bull!' he yelled suddenly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Dick entered into the joke. The bull's
loose! Look out! Beware of the bull!' he shouted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Anne gave a shriek. It all sounded so real
that, although she knew it was a joke, she felt half-scared. The bull!' she
cried.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Cecil turned green. His legs shook.
'W-w-w-where is it?' he stammered.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Look out behind you!' yelled Julian,
pointing. Poor Cecil, convinced that a large bull was about to pounce on him
from behind, gave an anguished cry and tore on tottering legs to the dairy. He
threw himself against Mrs Andrews.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'But there's no bull here,' said Mrs

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Helpless with laughter, the three children
made their way back to George. They tried to tell her about the make-believe
bull, but she turned away and wouldn't listen. Julian shrugged his shoulders.
Best to leave George to herself when she was in one of her rages! She didn't
lose her temper as often as she used to, but when she did she was very trying
indeed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>They went back to the camp with the basket
of food. Timmy followed soberly. He knew something was wrong with George and he
was unhappy. His tail was down, and he looked miserable. George wouldn't even
pat him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>When they got back to the camp, George

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'What? Tell me quickly!' begged Anne, but
George obstinately turned away her head as if she was not interested.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Julian began to relate all the curious

had finished. 'If that's what people mean by spook-trains, there was one
puffing in and out of that tunnel all right! I felt pretty scared, I can tell

alone.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

still looked furious.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'I suppose Timmy went with you,' she said.
'I think that was horrid of him - to go without waking me, when he knew I'd
like to be with you on the adventure.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Oh, don't be so silly,' said Dick, in
disgust. 'Fancy being angry with old Tim, too! You're making him miserable. And
anyway, he didn't come with us. He just came to meet us when we got back, and
then went off to keep Jock company on his way back to the farm.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Oh,' said George, and she reached out her
hand to pat Timmy, who was filled with delight. 'At least Timmy was loyal to me
then. That's something.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>There was a silence. Nobody ever knew quite
how to treat George when she was in one of her moods. It<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

but they couldn't very well go off and leave the camp just because George was
there, cross and sulky.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Anne took hold of George's arm. She was
miserable when George behaved like this. 'George,' she began, 'there's no need
to be cross with me, too. / haven't done anything!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

today?' said Julian, who could be just as obstinate as George when he wanted
to. 'Certainly not. This is my adventure and Dick's - and perhaps Jock's. Not
yours or Anne's.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>He got up and stalked down the hill with
Dick. George sat pulling bits of heather off the stems, looking mutinous and
angry. Anne blinked back tears. She hated this sort of thing. She got up to get
dinner ready. Perhaps after a good meal they would all feel better.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Mr Luffy was sitting outside his tent,
reading. He had already seen the children that morning. He looked up, smiling.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Hallo! Come to talk to me?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Yes,' said Julian, an idea uncurling
itself in his mind. 'Could I have a look at that map of yours, Mr<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Luffy? The big one you've got showing every
mile of these moorlands?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Of course. It's in the tent somewhere,'
said Mr Luffy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>The boys found it and opened it. Dick at
once guessed why Julian wanted it. Mr Luffy went on reading.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'It shows the railways that run under the
moorlands too, doesn't it?' said Julian. Mr Luffy nodded.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Yes. There are quite a few lines. I
suppose it was easier to tunnel under the moors from valley to valley rather
than make a permanent way over the top of them. In any case, a railway over the
moors would probably be completely snowed up in the wintertime.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>The boys bent their heads over the big map;
it showed the railways as dotted lines when they went underground, but by long
black lines when they appeared in the open air, in the various valleys.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>They found exactly where they were. Then
Julian's finger ran down the map a little and came to where a small line showed
itself at the end of a dotted line.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>He looked at Dick, who nodded. Yes - that
showed where the tunnel was, out of which the 'spook-train' had come, and the
lines to the deserted yard. Julian's finger went back from the yard to the
tunnel, where the dotted lines began. His finger traced the dotted lines a
little way till they became whole lines again. That was where the train came
out into another valley!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Then his finger showed where the tunnel
that led from the yard appeared to join up with another one, that also ran for
some distance before coming out into yet another valley. The boys looked at one
another in silence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Mr Luffy suddenly spotted a day-flying moth
and<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>got up to follow it. The boys took the
chance of talking to one another.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'The spook-train either runs through its
own tunnel to the valley beyond - or it turns off into this fork and runs along
to the other valley,' said Julian, in a low voice. 'I tell you what we'll do,
Dick. We'll get Mr Luffy to run us down to the nearest town to buy something -
and we'll slip along to the station there and see if we can't make a few
inquiries about these two tunnels. We may find out something.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Good idea,' said Dick, as Mr Luffy came
back. 'I say, sir, are you very busy today? Could you possibly run us down to
the nearest town after dinner?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Certainly, certainly,' said Mr Luffy,
amiably. The boys looked at one another in delight. Now they might find out
something! But they wouldn't take George with them. No - they would punish her
for her bad temper by leaving her behind!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

Anne was a marvellous camp-housekeeper. He looked approvingly at the spread set

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>George ate with the others, but said hardly
a word. She was brooding over her wrongs, and Mr Luffy looked at her several

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Are you quite well, George?' he said,
suddenly. George went red.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Yes, thank you,' she said, and tried to be
more herself, though she couldn't raise a smile at all. Mr Luffy watched her,
and was relieved to see that she ate as much as the others. Probably had some
sort of row, he guessed correctly. Well, it would blow over! He knew better
than to interfere.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>They finished lunch and drank all the lime
juice. It was a hot day and they were very thirsty indeed. Timmy emptied all
his dish of water and went and gazed longingly into the canvas bucket of
washing-<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

it, now that he knew he mustn't. Anne laughed, and poured some more water into
his dish.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Well,' said Mr Luffy, beginning to fill
his old brown pipe, 'if anyone wants to come into town with me this afternoon,
I'll be starting in fifteen minutes.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'No,' said George, and the boys heaved a
sigh of relief. They had guessed she wouldn't want to come with them - but, if
she'd know what they were going to try and find out, she would have come all
right!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

thought that George would be much better left on her own to work off her ill-feelings
that afternoon. 'See you later.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>George and Timmy set off. The others went
with Mr Luffy to where his car was parked beside the great rock. They got in.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Hi! The trailer's fastened to it,' called
Julian. 'Wait a bit. Let me get out and undo it. We don't want to take an empty

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Dear me. I always forget to undo the

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>The children winked at one another. Dear old

him like an old hen with one foolish chicken when he was at home.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>They went off in the car, jolting over the
rough road till they came to the smooth highway. They stopped in the centre of
the town. Mr Luffy said he would meet<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>The three of them set off together, leaving
Mr Luffy to go to the library and browse there. It seemed funny to be without George.
Anne didn't much like it, and said so.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Well, we don't like going off without
George either,' said Julian. 'But honestly, she can't behave like that and get
away with it. I thought she'd grown out of that sort of thing.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Well, you know how she adores an
adventure,' said Anne. 'Oh dear - if I hadn't felt so scared you'd have taken
me along, and George would have gone too. It's quite true what she said about
me being a coward.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'You're not,' said Dick. 'You can't help
being scared of things sometimes - after all, you're the youngest of us - but
being scared doesn't make you a coward. I've known you to be as brave as any of
us when you've been scared stiff!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Where are we going?' asked Anne. The boys
told her, and her eyes sparkled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Oh - are we going to find out where the
spook-train comes from? It might come from one of two valleys then, judging
from the map.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Yes. The tunnels aren't really very long
ones,' said Julian. 'Not more than a mile, I should think. We thought we'd make
some inquiries at the station and see if there's anyone who knows anything
about the old railway yard and the tunnel beyond. We shan't say a word about
the spook-train of course.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>They walked into the station. They went up
to a railway plan and studied it. It didn't tell them much. Julian turned to a
young porter who was wheeling some luggage along.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'I say! Could you help us? We're camping up
on the<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>moorlands, and we're quite near a deserted
railway yard with lines that run into an old tunnel. Why isn't the yard used
any more?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Don't know,' said the boy. 'You should ask
old Tucky there - see him? He knows all the tunnels under the moors like the
back of his hand. Worked in them all when he was a boy.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Thanks,' said Dick, pleased. They went
over to where an old whiskered porter was sitting in the sun, enjoying a rest
till the next train came in.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Excuse me,' said Julian politely. 'I've
been told that you know all about the moorland tunnels like the back of your
hand. They must be very, very interesting.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'My father and my grandfather built those
tunnels,' said the old porter, looking up at the children out of small faded
eyes that watered in the strong sunlight. 'And I've been guard on all the
trains that ran through them.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>He mumbled a long string of names, going
through all the list of tunnels in his mind. The children waited patiently till
he had finished.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>There's a tunnel near where we're camping
on the moorlands,' said Julian, getting a word in at last. 'We're not far from
Olly's Farm. We came across an old deserted railway yard, with lines that led
into a tunnel. Do you know it?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Oh yes, that's an old tunnel,' said Tucky,
nodding his grey head, on which his porter's cap sat all crooked. 'Hasn't been
used for many a long year. Nor the yard either. Wasn't enough traffic there,
far as I remember. They shut up the yard. Tunnel isn't used any more.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>The boys exchanged glances. So it wasn't
used any more! Well, they knew better.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'The tunnel joins another, doesn't it?'
said Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>The porter, pleased at their interest in
the old tunnels he knew so well, got up and went into an office behind. He came
out with a dirty, much-used map, which he spread out on his knee. His black
finger-nail pointed to a mark on the map.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>That's the yard, see? It was called O'lly's
Yard, after the farm. There're the lines to the tunnel. Here's the tunnel. It
runs right through to Kilty Vale - there it is. And here's where it used to
join the tunnel to Roker's Vale. But that was bricked up years ago. Something
happened there - the roof fell in, I think it was - and the company decided not
to use the tunnel to Roker's Vale at all.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>The children listened with the utmost
interest. Julian reasoned things out in his mind. If that spook-train came from
anywhere then it must come from Kilty Vale, because that was the only place the
lines went to now, since the way to Roker's Vale had been bricked up where the
tunnels joined.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'I suppose no trains run through the tunnel
from Kilty Vale to Olly's Yard now, then?' he said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Tucky snorted. 'Didn't I tell you it hasn't
been used for years? The yard at Kilty Vale's been turned into something else,
though the lines are still there. There's been no engine through that tunnel
since I was a young man.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>This was all very, very interesting. Julian
thanked old Tucky so profusely that he wanted to tell the children everything
all over again. He even gave them the old map.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Oh, thanks,' said Julian, delighted to have
it. He looked at the others. 'This'll be jolly useful!' he said, and they
nodded.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>They left the pleased old man and went out
into the town. They found a little park and sat down on a seat.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>They were longing to discuss all that Tucky
had told them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'It's jolly strange,' said Dick. 'No trains
run there now - the tunnel's not been used for ages - and Olly's Yard must have
been derelict for years.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'And yet, there appear to be trains that
come and go!' said Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Then, they must be spook-trains,' said
Anne, her eyes wide and puzzled. 'Julian, they must be, mustn't they?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Looks like it,' said Julian. 'It's most
mysterious. I can't understand it.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Ju,' said Dick, suddenly. 'I know what
we'll do! We'll wait one night again till we see the spook-train come out of
the tunnel to the yard. Then one of us can sprint off to the other end of the
tunnel - it's only about a mile long - and wait for it to come out the other
side! Then we'll find out why a train still runs from Kilty Vale to Olly's Yard
through that old tunnel.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Jolly good idea,' said Julian, thrilled.
'What about tonight? If Jock comes, he can go, too. If he doesn't, just you and
I will go. Nat George.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>They all felt excited. Anne wondered if she
would be brave enough to go too, but she knew that when the night came she
wouldn't feel half as brave as she did now! No, she wouldn't go. There was
really no need for her to join in this adventure at present. It hadn't even
turned out to be a proper one yet - it was only an unsolved mystery!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>George hadn't come back from her walk when
they reached the camp. They waited for her, and at last she appeared with
Timmy, looking tired out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Sorry I was an ass this morning,' she said
at once. 'I've walked my temper off! Don't know what came over me.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'That's all right,' said Julian amiably.
'Forget it.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>They were all very glad that George had
recovered her temper, for she was a very prickly person indeed when she was
angry. She was rather subdued and said nothing at all about spook-trains or
tunnels. So they said nothing either.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>The night was fine and clear. Stars shone
out brilliantly again in the sky. The children said good night to Mr Luffy at
ten o'clock and got into their sleeping-bags. Julian and Dick did not mean to
go exploring till midnight, so they lay and talked quietly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>About eleven o'clock they heard somebody
moving cautiously outside. They wondered if it was Jock, but he did not call
out to them. Who could it be?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Then Julian saw a familiar head outlined
against the starlit sky. It was George. But what in the world was she doing? He
couldn't make it out at all. Whatever it was, she wasn't making any noise over
it, and she obviously thought the boys were asleep. Julian gave a nice little
snore or two just to let her go on thinking so.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>At last she disappeared. Julian waited a
few minutes and then put his head cautiously out of the tent opening. He felt
about, and his fingers brushed against some string. He grinned to himself and
got back into the tent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'I've found out what George was
doing,&quot; he whispered. 'She's put string across the entrance of our tent,
and I bet it runs to her tent and she's tied it to her big toe or something, so
that if we go out without her she'll feel the pull of the string when we go
through it and wake up and follow us!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Good old George,' chuckled Dick. 'Well,
she'll be unlucky. We'll squeeze out under the sides of the tent!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Which was what they did do at about a
minute past twelve! They didn't disturb George's string at all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>They were out on the heather and away down
the slope while George was sleeping soundly in her tent beside Anne, waiting
for the pull on her toe which didn't come. Poor George!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>The boys arrived at the deserted railway
yard and looked to see if Wooden-Leg Sam's candle was alight. It was. So the
spook-train hadn't come along that night, yet.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>They were just scrambling down to the yard
when they heard the train coming. There was the same rumbling noise as before,
muffled by the tunnel - and then out of the tunnel, again with no lamps, came
the spook-train, clanking on its way to the yard!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Quick, Dick! You sprint off to the tunnel
opening and watch for the train to go back in again. And I'll find my way across
the moor to the other end of the tunnel. There was a path marked on that old
map, and I'll follow that!' Julian's words tumbled over each other in his
excitement. Til jolly well watch for the spook-train to complete its journey,
and see if it vanishes into thin air or what!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>And off he went to find the path that led
over the moors to the other end of the tunnel. He meant to see what happened at
the other end if he had to run all the way!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>14<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
</span>Jock comes to camp<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Julian found the path quite by chance and
went along it as fast as he could. He used his torch, for he did not think he
would meet anyone out on such a lonely way at that time of night. The path was
very much overgrown, but he could follow it fairly easily, even running at
times.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'If that spook-train stops about twenty
minutes in the yard again, as it did before, it will give me just about time to
reach the other end of the tunnel,' panted Julian. Til be at Kilty's Yard
before it comes.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>It seemed a very long way. But at last the
path led downwards, and some way below him Julian could see what might be a
railway yard. Then he saw that big sheds were built there - or what looked like
big sheds in the starlight.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>He remembered what the old porter had said.
Kilty's Yard was used for something else now-maybe the lines had been taken up.
Maybe even the tunnel had been stopped up, too. He slipped quickly down the
path and came into what had once been the old railway yard. Big buildings
loomed up on every side. Julian thought they must be workshops of some kind. He
switched his torch on and off very quickly, but the short flash had shown him
what he was looking for -two pairs of railway lines. They were old and rusty,
but he knew they must lead to the tunnel.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>He followed them closely, right up to the
black<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>mouth of the dark tunnel. He couldn't see
inside at all. He switched his torch on and off quickly. Yes - the lines led
right inside the tunnel. Julian stopped and wondered what to do.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Til sneak into the tunnel a little way and
see if it's bricked up anywhere,' he thought. So in he went, walking between
one pair of lines. He put on his torch, certain that no one would see its light
and challenge him to say what he was doing out so late at night.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>The tunnel stretched before him, a great
yawning hole, disappearing into deep blackness. It was certainly not bricked
up. Julian saw a little niche in the brickwork of the tunnel and decided to
crouch in it. It was one of the niches made for workmen to stand in when trains
went by in the old days.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Julian crouched down in the dirty old niche
and waited. He glanced at the luminous face of his watch. He had been twenty
minutes getting here. Maybe the train would be along in a few minutes. He would
be very, very close to it! Julian couldn't help wishing that Dick was with him.
It was so eerie waiting there in the dark for a mysterious train that
apparently belonged to no one and came and went from nowhere to nowhere!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>He waited and he waited. Once he thought he
heard a rumble far away down the tunnel, and he held his breath, feeling
certain that the train was coming. But it didn't come. Julian waited for half
an hour and still the train had not appeared. What had happened to it?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Til wait another ten minutes and then I'm
going,' Julian decided. Tve had about enough of hiding in a dark, dirty tunnel
waiting for a train that doesn't come! Maybe it has decided to stay in Olly's
Yard for the night.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>After ten minutes he gave it up. He left
the tunnel, went into Kilty's Yard and then up the path to the<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>moors. He hurried along it, eager to see if
Dick was at the other end of the tunnel. Surely he would wait there till Julian
came back!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Dick was there, tired and impatient. When
he saw a quick flash from Julian's torch he answered it with his own. The two
boys joined company thankfully.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'You have been ages!' said Dick,
reproachfully. 'What happened? The spook-train went back into the tunnel ages
and ages ago. It only stayed about twenty minutes in the yard again.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Went back into the tunnel!' exclaimed
Julian. 'Did it really? Well, it never came out the other side! I waited for
ages. I never even heard it - though I did hear a very faint rumble once, or
thought I did.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>The boys fell silent, puzzled and
mystified. What sort of a train was this that puffed out of a tunnel at dead of
night, and went back again, but didn't appear out of the other end?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'I suppose the entrance to that second
tunnel the porter told us about is really bricked up?' said Julian at last. 'If
it wasn't, the train could go down there, of course.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Yes. That's the only solution, if the
train's a real one and not a spook one,' agreed Dick. 'Well, we can't go
exploring the tunnels now - let's wait and do it in the daytime. I've had
enough tonight!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Julian had had enough too. In silence the
two boys went back to camp. They quite forgot the string in front of their
tent, and scrambled right through it. They got into the sleeping-bags
thankfully.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>The string, fastened to George's big toe
through a hole she had cut in her sleeping-bag, pulled hard, and George woke up
with a jump. Timmy was awake, having heard the boys come back. He licked George
when she sat up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>George had not undressed properly. She slipped
quickly out of her bag and crawled out of her tent. Now she would catch the two
boys going off secretly and follow them!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>But there was no sign or sound of them
anywhere around. She crawled silently to their tent. Both boys had fallen
asleep immediately, tired out with their midnight trip. Julian snored a little,
and Dick breathed so deeply that George could quite well hear him as she
crouched outside, listening. She was very puzzled. Someone had pulled at her
toe - so somebody must have scrambled through that string. After listening for
a few minutes, she gave it up and went back to her tent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>In the morning, George was furious! Julian
and Dick related their night's adventure, and George could hardly believe that
once again they had gone without her - and that they had managed to get away
without disturbing the string! Dick saw George's face and couldn't help
laughing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Sorry, old thing. We discovered your
little trick and avoided it when we set out - but typically, we forgot all
about it coming back. We must have given your toe a frightful tug. Did we? I
suppose you did tie the other end of the string to your toe?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>George looked as if she could throw all the
breakfast things at him. Fortunately for everyone, Jock arrived at that moment.
He didn't wear his usual beaming smile but seemed rather subdued.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Hallo, Jock!' said Julian. 'Just in time
for a spot of breakfast. Sit down and join us.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'I can't,' said Jock. 'I've only a few
minutes. Listen. Isn't it rotten - I'm to go away and stay with my stepfather's
sister for two weeks! Two weeks! You'll be gone when I come back, won't you?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Yes. But, Jock, why have you got to go
away?' said<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Dick, surprised. 'Has there been a row or
something?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'I don't know,' said Jock. 'Mum won't say,
but she looks pretty miserable. My stepfather's in a frightful temper. It's my
opinion they want me out of the way for some reason. I don't know this sister
of my stepfather's very well - only met her once - but she's pretty awful.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Well, come over here and stay with us, if
they want to get rid of you,' said Julian, sorry for Jock. Jock's face
brightened.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'I say, that's a fine idea!' he said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Smashing,' agreed Dick. 'Well, I don't see
what's to stop you. If they want to get rid of you, it can't matter where you
go for a fortnight. We'd love to have you.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Right. I'll come,' said Jock. 'I'll not
say a word about it, though, to my stepfather. I'll let Mum into the secret.
She was going to take me away today, but I'll just tell her I'm coming to you
instead. I don't think she'll split on me, and I hope she'll square things with
my step-aunt.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>jock's face beamed again now. The others
beamed back, even George, and Timmy wagged his tail. It would be nice to have
Jock - and what a lot they had to tell him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>He went off to break the news to his
mother, while the others washed up and cleared things away. George became sulky
again when Jock was gone. She simply could not or would not realise that Julian
meant what he said!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>When they began to discuss everything that
had happened the night before, George refused to listen. 'I'm not going to
bother about your stupid spook-trains any more,' she said. 'You wouldn't let me
join you when I wanted to, and now I shan't take any interest in the matter.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>And she walked off with Timmy, not saying
where she was going.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Well, let her go,' said Julian,
exasperated and cross. 'What does she expect me to do? Climb down and say we'll
let her come the next night we go?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'We said we'd go in the daytime,' said
Dick. 'She could come then, because if Anne doesn't want to come it won't
matter leaving her here alone in the daytime.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'You're right,' said Julian. 'Let's call
her back and tell her.' But by that time George was out of hearing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'She's taken sandwiches,' said Anne. 'She

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Jock came back after a time, with two rugs
and an extra jersey and more food. 'I had hard work to persuade Mum,' he said.
'But she said yes at last. Though mind you, I'd have come anyhow! I'm not going
to be shoved about by my stepfather just out of spite. I say - isn't this
great! I never thought I'd be camping out with you. If there isn't room in your
tent for me, Julian, I can sleep out on the heather.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

do?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Oh, mess about till lunchtime,' said
Julian. 'Then we might go for a walk.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Mr Luffy went back to his tent and they
could hear him whistling softly as he set to work. Suddenly Jock sat up
straight and looked alarmed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'What's the matter?' asked Dick. Then he
heard what Jock had heard. A shrill whistle blown loudly by somebody some way
off.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>That's my stepfather's whistle,' said Jock.
'He's whistling for me. Mum must have told him, or else he's found out I've
come over here.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Quick - let's scoot away and hide,' said
Anne. 'If you're not here he can't take you back! Come on! Maybe he'll get
tired of looking for you, and go.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Nobody could think of a better idea, and
certainly nobody wanted to face a furious Mr Andrews. All four shot down the
slope and made their way to where the heather was high and thick. They burrowed
into it and lay still, hidden by some high bracken.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Mr Andrews's voice could soon be heard,
shouting for Jock, but no Jock appeared. Mr Andrews came out by Mr Luffy's
tent. Mr Luffy, surprised at the shouting, put his head out of his tent to see
what it was all about. He didn't like the look of Mr Andrews at all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Where's Jock?' Mr Andrews demanded,
scowling at him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'I really do not know,' said Mr Luffy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'He's got to come back,' said Mr Andrews,
roughly. 'I won't have him hanging about here with those kids.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'What's wrong with them?' inquired Mr
Luffy. 'I must say I find them very well-behaved and pleasant-mannered. '<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Mr Andrews stared at Mr Luffy, and put him
down as a silly, harmless old fellow who would probably help him to get Jock
back if he went about it the right way.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Now look here,' said Mr Andrews. 'I don't
know<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>who you are, but you must be a friend of
the children's. And if so, then I'd better warn you they're running into
danger. See?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Really? In what way?' asked Mr Luffy,
mildly and disbelievingly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Well, there's bad and dangerous places
about these moorlands,' said Mr Andrews. 'Very bad. I know them. And those
children have been messing about in them. See? And if Jock comes here, he'll
start messing about too, and I don't want him to get into any danger. It would
break his mother's heart.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Quite, 'said Mr Luffy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Well, will you talk to him and send him
back?' said Mr Andrews. 'That railway yard now - that's a most dangerous place.
And folks do say that there're spook-trains there. I wouldn't want Jock to be
mixed up in anything of that sort.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Quite,' said Mr Luffy again, looking
closely at Mr Andrews. 'You seem very concerned about this - er -railway yard.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Me? Oh, no,' said Mr Andrews. 'Never been
near the horrible place. I wouldn't want to see spook-trains - make me run a
mile! It's just that I don't want Jock to get into danger. I'd be most obliged
if you'd talk to him and send him home, when they all come back from wherever
they are.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Quite,' said Mr Luffy again, most
irritatingly. Mr Andrews gazed at Mr Luffy's bland face and suddenly wished he
could smack it. 'Quite, quite, quite!' Gr-r-r-r-r-r-r!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>He turned and went away. When he had gone
for some time, and was a small speck in the distance, Mr Luffy called loudly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'He's gone! Please send Jock here so that I
can - er -address a few words to him.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Four children appeared from their heathery
hiding-place. Jock went over to Mr Luffy, looking mutinous.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'I just wanted to say,' said Mr Luffy,
'that I quite understand why you want to be away from your stepfather, and that
I consider it's no business of mine where you go in order to get away from
him!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Jock grinned. 'Oh, thanks awfully,' he
said. 'I thought you were going to send me back!' He rushed over to the others.
'It's all right,' he said. 'I'm going to stay, and, I say - what about going
and exploring down that tunnel after lunch? We might find that spook-train
then!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Good idea!' said Julian. 'We will! Poor
old George -she'll miss that little adventure too!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>George had gone off with one fixed idea in
her mind. She was going to find out something about that mysterious tunnel! She
thought she would walk over the moorlands to Kilty's Yard, and see what she
could see there. Maybe she could walk right back through the tunnel itself!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>She soon came to Olly's Yard. There it lay
below her, with Wooden-Leg Sam pottering about. She went down to speak to him.
He didn't see or hear her coming and jumped violently when she called to him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>He swung round, squinting at her fiercely.
'You clear off!' he shouted. 'I've been told to keep you children out of here,
see? Do you want me to lose my job?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Who told you to keep us out?' asked
George, puzzled as to who could have known they had been in the yard.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'He did, see?' said the old man. He rubbed
his eyes, and then peered at George short-sightedly again. 'I've broken my
glasses,' he said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Who's &quot;he&quot; - the person who told
you to keep us out?' said George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>But the old watchman seemed to have one of
his sudden strange changes of temper again. He bent down and picked up a large
cinder. He was about to fling it at George when Timmy gave a loud and menacing
growl. Sam dropped his arm.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'You clear out,' he said. 'You don't want
to get a poor old man like me into trouble, do you? You look a nice kind boy
you do. You wouldn't get Wooden-Leg Sam into trouble, would you?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>George turned to go. She decided to take
the path that led to the tunnel and peep inside. But when she got there there
was nothing to see. She didn't feel that she wanted to walk all alone inside
that dark mouth, so she took the path that Julian had taken the night before,
over the top of the tunnel. But she left it half-way to look at a curious bump
that jutted up from the heather just there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>She scraped away at the heather and found
something hard beneath. She pulled at it but it would not give. Timmy, thinking
she was obligingly digging for rabbits, came to help. He scrambled below the
heather - and then he suddenly gave a bark of fright and disappeared!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>George screamed: 'Timmy! What have you
done? Where are you?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>To her enormous relief she heard Timmy's
bark some way down. Where could he be? She called again, and once more Timmy
barked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>George tugged at the tufts of heather, and
then suddenly she saw what the curious mound was. It was a built-up vent-hole
for the old tunnel - a place where the smoke came curling out in the days when
trains ran there often. It had been barred across with iron, but the bars had
rusted and fallen in, and heather had grown thickly over them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Oh, Timmy, you must have fallen down the
vent,' said George, anxiously. 'But not very far down. Wait a bit and I'll see
what I can do. If only the others were here to help!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>But they weren't, and George had to work
all by<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>herself to try and get down to the broken
bars. It took her a very long time, but at last she had them exposed, and saw
where Timmy had fallen down.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>He kept giving short little barks, as if to
say: 'It's all right. I can wait. I'm not hurt!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>George had to sit down and take a rest
after her efforts. She was hungry, but she said to herself that she would not
eat till she had somehow got down to Timmy, and found out where he was. Soon
she began her task again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>She climbed down through the fallen-in
vent. It was very difficult, and she was terrified of the rusty old iron bars
breaking off under her weight. But they didn't.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Once down in the vent she discovered steps
made of great iron nails projecting out. Some of them had thin rungs across.
There had evidently once been a ladder up to the top of the vent. Most of the
rungs had gone, but the iron nails that supported them still stood in the brick
walls of the old round vent. She heard Timmy give a little bark. He was quite
near her now.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Cautiously she went down the great hole.
Her foot touched Timmy. He had fallen on a collection of broken iron bars,
which, caught in part of the old iron ladder, stuck out from it, and made a
rough landing-place for the dog to fall on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Oh, Timmy,' said George, horrified.
'However am I going to get you out of here? This hole goes right down into the
tunnel.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>She couldn't possibly pull Timmy up the
hole. It was equally impossible to get him down. He could never climb down the
iron ladder, especially as it had so many rungs missing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>George was in despair. 'Oh, Timmy! Why did
I lose my temper and walk out on the others to do some exploring all by myself?
Don't fall, Timmy. You'll break your legs if you do.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Timmy had no intention of falling. He was
frightened, but so far his curious landing-place felt firm. He kept quite
still.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Listen, Tim,' said George, at last. 'The
only thing I can think of is to climb down round it somehow and see how far it
is to the tunnel itself. There might even be someone there to help! No, that's
silly. There can't be. But I might find an old rope - anything - that I could
use to help you down with. Oh, dear, what a horrible nightmare!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>George gave Timmy a reassuring pat, and
then began to feel about for the iron rungs with her feet. Further down they
were all there, and it was easy to climb lower and lower. She was soon down in
the tunnel itself. She had her torch with her and switched it on. Then she
nearly gave a scream of horror.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Just near to her was a silent train! She
could almost touch the engine. Was it - could it be - the spook-train itself?
George stared at it, breathing fast.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>It looked very, very old and out-of-date.
It was smaller than the trains she was used to - the engine was smaller and so
were the trucks. The funnel was longer and the wheels were different from those
of ordinary trains. George stared at the silent train by the light of her
torch, her mind in a muddle. She really didn't know what to think!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>It must be the spook-train! It had come
from this tunnel the night before, and had gone back again - and it hadn't run
all the way through to Kilty's Yard, because Julian had watched for it, and it
hadn't come out there. No - it had run here, to the middle of the dark tunnel,
and there it stood, waiting for night so that it might run again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>George shivered. The train belonged to
years and years ago! Who drove it at night? Did anybody? Or did it run along
without a driver, remembering its old days and old ways? No, that was silly.
Trains didn't think or remember. George shook herself and remembered Timmy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>And just at that very moment, poor Timmy
lost his foot-hold on the iron bars, and fell! He had stretched out to listen
for George, his foot had slipped- and now he was hurtling down the vent! He
gave a mournful howl.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>He struck against part of the ladder and
that stopped his headlong fall for a moment. But down he went again, scrabbling
as he fell, trying to get hold of something to save himself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>George heard him howl and knew he was
falling. She was so horror-stricken that she simply couldn't move. She stood
there at the bottom of the vent like a statue, not even breathing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Timmy fell with a thump beside her, and a
groan was jerked out of him. In a trice George was down by him on her knees.
'Timmy! Are you hurt? Are you alive? Oh, Timmy, say something!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Woof,' said Timmy, and got up rather
unsteadily on his four legs. He had fallen on a pile of the softest soot! The
smoke of many, many years had sooted the walls of the vent, and the weather had
sent it down to the bottom, until quite a pile had collected at one side. Timmy
had fallen plump in the middle of it, and almost buried himself. He shook
himself violently, and soot flew out all over George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>She didn't know or care. She hugged him,
and her face and clothes grew as black as soot! She felt about and found the
soft pile that had saved Timmy from being hurt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'It's soot! I came down the other side of
the vent, so I didn't know the soot was there. Oh, Timmy, what a bit of luck
for you! I thought you'd be killed - or at least badly hurt,' said George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>He licked her sooty nose and didn't like
the taste of it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>George stood up. She didn't like the idea
of climbing up that horrid vent again - and, anyway, Timmy couldn't. The only
thing to do was to walk out of the tunnel. She wouldn't have fancied walking
through the tunnel before, in case she met the spook-train-but here it was,
close beside her, and she had been so concerned about Timmy that she had quite
forgotten it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Timmy went over to the engine and smelt the
wheels. Then he jumped up into the cab. Somehow the sight of Timmy doing that
took away all George's fear. If Timmy could jump up into the spook-train, there
couldn't be much for her to be afraid of!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>She decided to examine the trucks. There
were four of them, all covered trucks. Shining her torch, she climbed up into
one of them, pulling Timmy up behind her. She expected to find it quite empty,
unloaded many, many years ago by long-forgotten rail way men.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>But it was loaded with boxes! George was
surprised. Why did a spook-train run about with boxes in it? She shone her
torch on to one - and then quickly switched it out!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>She had heard a noise in the tunnel. She
crouched down in the truck, put her hand on Timmy's collar, and listened. Timmy
listened, too, the hackles rising on his neck.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>It was a clanging noise. Then there came a
bang.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Then a light shone out, and the tunnel was
suddenly as bright as day!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>The light came from a great lamp in the
side of the tunnel. George peeped cautiously out through a crack in the truck.
She saw that this place must be where the tunnel forked. One fork went on to
Kilty's Yard - but surely the other fork was supposed to be bricked up? George
followed the lines with her eyes. One set went on down the tunnel to Kilty's
Yard, the other set ran straight into a great wall, which was built across the
second tunnel, that once led to Roker's Yard.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Yes - it is bricked up, just as the old porter
told Julian,' said George to herself. And then she stared in the greatest
amazement, clutching the side of the truck, hardly believing her eyes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Part of the wall was opening before her!
Before her very eyes, a great mass of it slid back in the centre of the wall -
back and back - until a strange-shaped opening, about the size of the train
itself, showed in the thick wall. George gasped. Whatever could be happening?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>A man came through the opening. George felt
sure she had seen him before somewhere. He came up to the engine of the train
and swung himself into the cab.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>There were all sorts of sounds then from
the cab. What was the man doing? Starting the fire to run the train? George did
not dare to try and see. She was trembling now, and Timmy pressed himself
against her to comfort her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Then came another set of noises - steam
noises. The man must be going to start the engine moving. Smoke came from the
funnel. More noises, and some clanks and clangs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>It suddenly occurred to George that the man
might be going to take the train through that little opening in<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>the bricked-up wall. Then-supposing he shut
the wall up again - George would be a prisoner! She would be in the truck,
hidden behind that wall, and the wall would be closed so that she couldn't
escape.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'I must get out before it's too late,'
thought George, in a panic. 'I only hope the man doesn't see me!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>But just as she was about to try and get
out, the engine gave a loud 'choo-choo', and began to move backwards! It ran
down the lines a little way, then forward again, and this time its wheels were
on the set of lines that led to the second tunnel, where the small opening now
showed so clearly in the wall.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>George didn't dare to get out of the moving
train. So there she crouched as the engine steamed quickly to the hole in the
wall that stretched right across the other tunnel. That hole just fitted it! It
must have been made for it, thought George, as the train moved through it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>The train went right through and came out
in another tunnel. Here there was a bright light, too. George peered out
through the crack. There was more than a tunnel here! What looked like vast
caves stretched away on each side of the tunnel, and men lounged about in them.
Who on earth were they, and what were they doing with that old train?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>There was a curious noise at the back of
the train. The hole in the stout brick wall closed up once more! Now there was
no way in or out. 'It's like the Open-Sesame trick in Ali Baba and the Forty
Thieves,' thought George. 'And, like Ali Baba, I'm in the cave -and don't know
the way to get myself out! Thank goodness Timmy is with me!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>The train was now at a standstill. Behind
it was the thick wall - and then George saw that in front of it was a thick
wall, too! This tunnel must be bricked up in two places - and in between was
this extraordinary<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>cavern, or whatever it was. George puzzled
her head over the strange place, but couldn't make head or tail ofit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Well! Whatever would the others say if
they knew you and I were actually in the spook-train itself, tucked away in its
hiding-place where nobody in the world can find it?' whispered George to Timmy.
'What are we to do, Timmy?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Timmy wagged his tail cautiously. He didn't
understand all this. He wanted to lie low for a bit and see how things turned
out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'We'll wait till the men have gone away,
Timmy,' whispered George. 'That is, if they ever do! Then we'll get out and see
if we can manage that Open-Sesame entrance and get away. We'd better tell Mr
Luffy about all this. There's something very strange and very mysterious here -
and we've fallen headlong into it!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Jock was really enjoying himself at the
camp. He had a picnic lunch with the others, and ate as much as they did,
looking very happy. Mr Luffy joined them, and Jock beamed at him, feeling that
he was a real friend.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Where's George?' asked Mr Luffy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Gone off by herself,' said Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Have you quarrelled, by any chance?' said
Mr Luffy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'A bit,' said Julian. 'We have to let
George get over it by herself, Mr Luffy. She's like that.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Where's she gone?' said Mr Luffy, helping
himself to a tomato. 'Why isn't she back to dinner?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'She's taken hers with her,' said Anne. 'I
feel a bit worried about her, somehow. I hope she's all right.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Mr Luffy looked alarmed. 'I feel a bit
worried myself,' he said. 'Still, she's got Timmy with her.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'We're going off on a bit of exploring,'
said Julian, when they had all finished eating. 'What are you going to do, Mr
Luffy?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'I think I'll come with you,' said Mr
Luffy, unexpectedly. The children's hearts sank. They couldn't possibly go
exploring for spook-trains in the tunnel if Mr Luffy was with them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Well - I don't think it will be very
interesting for you, sir,' said Julian, rather feebly. However, Mr Luffy took
the hint and'realised he wasn't wanted that afternoon.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Right,' he said. 'In that case I'll stay
here and mess about.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>The children sighed with relief. Anne
cleared up, with Jock helping her, and then they called good-bye to Mr Luffy
and set off, taking their tea with them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Jock was full of excitement. He was so
pleased to be with the others, and he kept thinking of sleeping in the camp
that night - what am it would be! Good old Mr Luffy, taking his side like that.
He bounded after the others joyfully as they went off to the old railway yard.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Wooden-Leg Sam was pottering about there as
usual. They waved to him, but he didn't wave back. Instead he shook his fist at
them and tried to bawl in his husky voice: 'You clear out! Trespassing, that's
what you are. Don't you come down here or I'll chase you!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Well, we won't go down then,' said Dick,
with a grin. 'Poor old man - thinking of chasing us with that wooden leg of
his. We won't give him the chance. We'll just walk along here, climb down the
lines and walk up them to the tunnel.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Which is what they did, much to the rage of
poor Sam. He yelled till his voice gave out, but they took no notice, and
walked quickly up the lines. The mouth of the tunnel looked very round and
black as they came near.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Now we'll jolly well walk right through
this tunnel and see where that spook-train is that came out of it the other
night,' said Julian. 'It didn't come out the other end, so it must be somewhere
in the middle of the tunnel.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'If it's a real spook-train, it might
completely disappear,' said Anne, not liking the look of the dark tunnel at
all. The others laughed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'It won't have disappeared,' said Dick. 'We
shall come across it somewhere, and we'll examine it<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>thoroughly and try and find out exactly
what it is, and why it comes and goes in such a mysterious manner.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>They walked into the black tunnel, and
switched on their torches, which made little gleaming paths in front of them.
They walked up the middle of one pair of lines, Julian in front keeping a sharp
look-out for anything in the shape of a train!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>The lines ran on and on. The children's
voices sounded weird and echoing in the long tunnel. Anne kept close to Dick,
and half wished she hadn't come. Then she remembered that George had called her
a coward, and she put up her head, determined not to show that she was scared.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Jock talked almost without stopping. Tve
never done anything like this in my life. I call this a proper adventure,
hunting for spook-trains in a dark tunnel. It makes me feel nice and shivery
all over. I do hope we find the train. It simply must be here somewhere!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>They walked on and on and on. But there was
no sign of any train. They came to where the tunnel forked into the second one,
that used to run to Roker's Vale. Julian flashed his torch on the enormous
brick wall that stretched across the second tunnel.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Yes, it's well and truly bricked up,' he
said. 'So that only leaves this tunnel to explore. Come on.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>They went on again, little knowing that
George and Timmy were behind that brick wall, hidden in a truck of the
spook-train itself! They walked on and on down the lines, and found nothing
interesting at all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>They saw a little round circle of bright
light some way in front of them. 'See that?' said Julian. 'That must be the end
of this tunnel - the opening that goes into Kilty's Yard. Well, if the train
isn't between here and Kilty's Yard, it's gone!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>In silence they walked down the rest of the
tunnel,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>and came out into the open air. Workshops
were built all over Kilty's Yard. The entrance to the tunnel was weed-grown and
neglected. Weeds grew even across the lines there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Well, no train has been out of this tunnel
here for years,' said Julian, looking at the thick weeds. 'The wheels would
have chopped the weeds to bits.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'It's extraordinary,' said Dick, puzzled.
'We've been right through the tunnel and there's no train there at all, yet we
know it goes in and out of it. What's happened to it?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'It is a spook-train,' said Jock, his face
red with excitement. 'Must be. It only exists at night, and then comes out on
its lines, like it used to do years ago.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'I don't like thinking that,' said Anne,
troubled. 'It's a horrid thought.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'What are we going to do now?' Julian
asked. 'We seem to have come to a blank. No train, nothing to see, empty
tunnel. What a dull end to an adventure.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Let's walk back all the way again,' said
Jock - he wanted to squeeze as much out of this adventure as he could. 'I know
we shan't see the train this time any more than we did the last time, but you
never know!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'I'm not coming through that tunnel again,'
said Anne. 'I want to be out in the sun. I'll walk over the top of the tunnel,
along the path there that Julian took the other night and you three can walk
back, and meet me at the other end.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Right,' said Julian and the three boys
disappeared into the dark tunnel. Anne ran up the path that led alongside the
top of it. How good it was to be in the open air again! That horrid tunnel! She
ran along cheerfully, glad to be out in the sun.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>She got to the other end of the tunnel
quite quickly, and sat down on the path above the yard to wait for the<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>others. She looked for Wooden-Leg Sam. He
was nowhere to be seen. Perhaps he was in his little hut.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>She hadn't been there for more than two
minutes when something surprising happened. A car came bumping slowly down the
rough track to the yard! Anne sat up and watched. A man got out - and Anne's
eyes almost fell out of her head. Why, it was - surely it was Mr Andrews,
Jock's stepfather!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>He went over to Sam's hut and threw open
the door. Anne could hear the sound of voices. Then she heard another noise -
the sound of a heavy lorry coming. She saw it come cautiously down the steep,
rough track. It ran into an old tumbledown shed and stayed there. Then three
men came out and Anne stared at them. Where had she seen them before?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Of course! They're the farm labourers at
Jock's farm!' she thought. 'But what are they doing here? How very strange!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Mr Andrews joined the men and, to Anne's
dismay, they began to walk up the lines to the tunnel! Her heart almost
stopped. Goodness, Julian, Dick and Jock were still in that tunnel, walking
through it. They would bump right into Mr Andrews and his men - and then what
would happen? Mr Andrews had warned them against going there, and had ordered
Jock not to go.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Anne stared at the four men walking into
the far-off mouth of the tunnel. What could she do? How could she warn the
boys? She couldn't! She would just have to stay there and wait for them to come
out - probably chased by a furious Mr Andrews and the other men. Oh dear, dear
- if they were caught they would probably all get an awful telling off! What
could she do?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'I can only wait,' thought poor Anne.
'There's nothing else to do. Oh, do come, Julian, Dick and Jock. I daren't do
anything but wait for you.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>She waited and waited. It was now long past
tea-time. Julian had the tea, so there was nothing for Anne to eat. Nobody came
out of the tunnel. Not a sound was heard. Anne at last decided to go down and
ask Wooden-Leg Sam a few questions. So, rather afraid, the girl set off down to
the yard.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Sam was in his hut, drinking cocoa, and
looking very sour. Something had evidently gone wrong. When he saw Anne's
shadow across the doorway he got up at once, shaking his fist.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'What, you children again! You went into
that tunnel this afternoon, and so I went up and telephoned Mr Andrews to come
and catch you all, poking your noses in all the time? How did you get out of
that tunnel? Are the others with you? Didn't Mr Andrews catch you, eh?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Anne listened to all this in horror. So old
Sam had actually managed to telephone Mr Andrews, and tell tales on them - so
that Jock's stepfather and his men had come to catch them. This was worse than
ever.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'You come in here,' said Sam suddenly, and
he darted his big arm at her. 'Come on. I don't know where the others are, but
I'll get one of you!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Anne gave a scream and ran away at top
speed. Wooden-Leg Sam went after her for a few yards and then gave it up. He
bent down and picked up a handful of cinders. A shower of them fell all round
Anne, and made her run faster than ever.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>She tore up the path to the heather, and
was soon on the moors again, panting and sobbing. 'Oh, Julian! Oh, Dick! What's
happened to you? Oh, where's George? If only she would come home, she'd be
brave enough to look for them, but I'm not. I must tell Mr Luffy. He'll know
what to do!' She ran on and on, her feet catching continually in<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>the tufts of thick heather. She kept
falling over and scrambling up again. She now had only one idea in her mind -
to find Mr Luffy and tell him every single thing! Yes, she would tell him about
the spook-trains and all. There was something strange and important about the
whole thing now, and she wanted a grown-up's help.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>She staggered on and on. 'Mr Luffy! Oh, Mr
Luffy, where are you? MR LUFFY!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>But no Mr Luffy answered her. She came
round the gorse bushes she thought were the ones sheltering the camp - but,
alas, the camp was not there. Anne had lost her way!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'I'm lost,' said Anne, the tears running
down her cheeks. 'But I mustn't get scared. I must try to find the right path
now. Oh, dear, I'm quite lost! Mr LUFFY!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Poor Anne. She stumbled on blindly, hoping
to come to the camp, calling every now and again. 'Mr Luffy. Can you hear me?
MR LUFFFFFFFY!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>In the meantime, what had happened to the
three boys walking back through the tunnel? They had gone slowly along
examining the lines to see if a train could have possibly run along them
recently. Few weeds grew in the dark airless tunnel, so they could not tell by
those.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>But, when they came about half-way, Julian
noticed an interesting thing. 'Look,' he said, flashing his torch on to the
lines before and behind them. 'See that? The lines are black and rusty behind
us now, but here this pair of lines is quite bright - as if they had been used
a lot.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>He was right. Behind them stretched black
and rusty lines, sometimes buckled in places - but in front of them, stretching
to the mouth of the tunnel leading to Olly's Yard, the lines were bright, as if
train-wheels had run along them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'That's funny,' said Dick. 'Looks as if the
spook-train ran only from here to Olly's Yard and back. But why? And where in
the world is it now? It's vanished into thin air!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Julian was as puzzled as Dick. Where could
a train be if it was not in the tunnel? It had obviously run to the middle of
the tunnel, and then stopped - but where had it gone now?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Let's go to the mouth of the tunnel and
see if the lines are bright all the way,' said Julian at last. 'We<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>can't discover much here - unless the train
suddenly materialises in front of us!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>They went on down the tunnel, their torches
flashing on the lines in front of them. They talked earnestly as they went.
They didn't see four men waiting for them, four men who crouched in a little
niche at the side of the tunnel, waiting there in the dark.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Well,' said Julian, 'I think -' and then
he stopped, because four dark figures suddenly pounced on the three boys and
held them fast. Julian gave a shout and struggled, but the man who had hold of
him was far too strong to escape from. Their torches were flung to the ground.
Julian's broke, and the other two torches lay there, their beams shining on the
feet of the struggling company.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>It didn't take more than twenty seconds to
make each boy a captive, his arms behind his back. Julian tried to kick, but
his captor twisted his arm so fiercely that he groaned in pain and stopped his
kicking.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Look here! What's all this about?'
demanded Dick. 'Who are you, and what do you think you're doing? We're only
three boys exploring an old tunnel. What's the harm in that?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Take them all away,' said a voice that
everyone recognised at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Mr Andrews! Is it you?' cried Julian. 'Set
us free. You know us - the boys at the camp. And Jock's here too. What do you
think you're doing?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Mr Andrews didn't answer, but he gave poor
Jock a box on the right ear that almost sent him to the ground.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Their captors turned them about, and led
them roughly up the tunnel, towards the middle. Nobody had a torch so it was
all done in the darkness and the<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>three boys stumbled badly, though the men
seemed sure-footed enough.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They
came to a halt after a time. Mr Andrews left them and Julian heard him go off
somewhere to the left. Then there came a curious noise - a bang, a clank, and
then a sliding, grating sound. What could be happening? Julian strained his
eyes in the darkness, but he could see nothing at all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>He didn't know that Mr Andrews was opening
the bricked-up wall through which the train had gone. He didn't know that he
and the others were being pushed out of the first tunnel into the other one,
through the curious hole in the wall. The three boys were shoved along in the
darkness, not daring to protest.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Now they were in the curious place between
the two walls which were built right across the place where the second tunnel
forked from the first one. The place where the spook-train stood in silence -
the place where George was, still hidden in one of the trucks with Timmy! But
nobody knew that, of course; not even Mr Andrews guessed that a girl and a dog
were listening in a truck nearby!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>He put on a torch and flashed it in the
faces of the three boys, who, although they were not showing any fear, felt
rather scared all the same. This was so weird and unexpected, and they had no
idea where they were at all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'You were warned not to go down to that
yard,' said the voice of one of the men. 'You were told it was a bad and
dangerous place. So it is. And you've got to suffer for not taking heed of the
warning! You'll be tied up and left here till we've finished our business.
Maybe that'll be three days, maybe it'll be three weeks!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Look here, you can't keep us prisoner for
all that time!' said Julian, alarmed. 'Why, there will be search<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>parties out for us all over the place! They
will be sure to find us.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Oh, no they won't,' said the voice. 'Nobody
will find you here. Now, Peters - tie 'em up!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Peters tied the three boys up. They had
their legs tied, and their arms too, and were set down roughly against a wall.
Julian protested again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'What are you doing this for? We're quite
harmless. We don't know a thing about your business, whatever it is.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'We're not taking any chances,' said the
voice. It was not Mr Andrews's voice, but a firm, strong one, full of
determination and a large amount of annoyance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'What about Mum?' said Jock suddenly, to
his stepfather. 'She'll be worried.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Well, let her be worried,' said the voice
again, answering before Mr Andrews could say a word. 'It's your own fault. You
were warned.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>The feet of the four men moved away. Then
there came the same noises again as the boys had heard before. They were made
by the hole in the wall closing up, but the boys didn't know that. They
couldn't imagine what they were. The noises stopped and there was dead silence.
There was also pitch darkness. The three boys strained their ears, and felt
sure that the men had gone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Well! The brutes! Whatever are they up
to?' said Julian in a low voice, trying to loosen the ropes round his hands.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'They've got some secret to hide,' said
Dick. 'Gosh, they've tied my feet so tightly that the rope is cutting into my
flesh.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'What's going to happen?' came Jock's
scared voice. This adventure didn't seem quite so grand to him now.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Sh!' said Julian suddenly. 'I can hear
something!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>They all lay and listened. What was it they
could hear?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'It's - it's a dbg whining,' said Dick,
suddenly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>It was. It was Timmy in the truck with
George. He had heard the voices of the boys he knew, and he wanted to get to
them. But George, not sure yet that the men had gone, still had her hand on his
collar. Her heart beat for joy to think she was alone no longer. The three boys
- and Anne, too, perhaps - were there, in the same strange place as she and
Timmy were.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>The boys listened hard. The whining came
again. Then, George let go her hold of Timmy's collar, and he leapt headlong
out of the truck. His feet pattered eagerly over the ground. He went straight
to the boys in the darkness, and Julian felt a wet tongue licking his face. A
warm body pressed against him, and a little bark told him who it was.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Timmy! I say, Dick - it's Timmy!' cried
Julian, in joy. 'Where did he come from? Timmy, is it really you?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Woof,' said Timmy, and licked Dick next
and then Jock.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Where's George then?' wondered Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
</span>'Here,&quot; said a voice, and out of the truck scrambled George,
switching on her torch as she did so. She went over to the boys. 'Whatever's
happened? How did you come here? Were you captured or something?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Yes,' said Julian. 'But, George-where are
we? And what are you doing here too? It's like a peculiar dream!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Til cut your ropes first, before I stop to
explain anything,' said George, and she took out her sharp knife. In a few
moments she had cut the boys' bonds, and they all sat up, rubbing their sore
ankles and wrists, groaning.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Thanks, George! Now I feel fine,' said
Julian,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>getting up. 'Where are we? Gracious, is
that an engine there? WhaVs it doing here?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'That, Julian, is the spook-train!' said
George, with a laugh. 'Yes, it is, really.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'But we walked all the way down the tunnel
and out of the other end, without finding it,' said Julian puzzled. 'It's most
mysterious.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Listen, Ju,' said George. 'You know where
that second tunnel is bricked up, don't you? Well, there's a way in through the
wall - a whole bit of it moves back in a sort of Open-Sesame manner! The
spook-train can run in through the hole, on the rails. Once it's beyond the
wall it stops, and the hole is closed up again.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>George switched her torch round to show the
astonished boys the wall through which they had come. Then she swung her torch
to the big wall opposite. 'See that?' she said. 'There are two walls across
this second tunnel, with a big space in between - where the spook-train hides!
Clever, isn't it?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'It would be, if I could see any sense in
it,' said Julian. 'But I can't. Why should anyone mess about with a silly
spook-train at night?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'That's what we've got to find out,' said
George. 'And now's our chance. Look, Julian - look at all the caves stretching
out on either side of the tunnel here. They would make wonderful
hiding-places!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'What for?' said Dick. 'I can't make head

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

don't turn up? I only hope she doesn't come wandering up the<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>tunnel to meet us - she'll run into those
men if she does.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Everyone felt worried. Anne hated the
tunnel and she would be very frightened if people pounced on her in the
darkness. Julian turned to George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Swing your torch round and let's see these
caves. There doesn't seem to be anyone here now. We could have a snoop round.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>George swung her torch round, and Julian
saw vast and apparently fathomless caves stretching out on either side, cut out
of the sides of the tunnel. Jock saw something else. By the light of the torch
he caught sight of a switch on the wall. Perhaps it opened the hole in the
wall.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>He crossed to it and pulled it down.
Immediately the place was flooded with a bright light. It was a light-switch he
had found. They all blinked in the sudden glare.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'That's better,' said Julian, pleased.
'Good for you, Jock! Now we can see what we're doing.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>He looked at the spook-train standing
silently near them on its rails. It certainly looked very old and forgotten -
as if it belonged to the last century, not to this.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'It's quite a museum piece,' said Julian,
with interest. 'So that's what we heard puffing in and out of the tunnel at
night - old Spooky!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'I hid in that truck there,' said George,
pointing, and she told them her own adventure. The boys could hardly believe
she had actually puffed into this secret place, hidden on the spook-train
itself!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Come on - now let's look at these caves,'
said Dick. They went over to the nearest one. It was packed with crates and
boxes of all kinds. Julian pulled one open and whistled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'All black market stuff, I imagine. Look
here-crates of tea, crates of whisky and brandy, boxes and boxes of stuff-
goodness knows what! This is a real black market hiding-place!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>The boys explored a little further. The
caves were piled high with valuable stuff, worth thousands of pounds.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'All stolen, I suppose,' said Dick. 'But
what do they do with it? I mean - how do they dispose of it? They bring it here
in the train, of course, and hide it - but they must have some way of getting
rid of it.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Would they repack it on the^rain and run
it back to the yard when they had enough lorries to take it away?' said Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'No!' said Dick. 'Of course not. Let me see
- they steal it, pile it on to lorries at night, take it somewhere temporarily
. . .'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Yes - to my mother's farm!' said Jock, in
a scared voice. 'All those lorries there in the barn - that's what they're used
for! And they come down to Olly's Yard at night and the stuff is loaded in
secret on the old train that comes puffing out to meet them - and then it's
taken back here and hidden!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Wheeeee-ew!' Julian whistled. 'You're
right, Jock! That's just what happens. What a cunning plot - to use a perfectly
honest little farm as a hiding-place, to stock the farm with black-market men
for labourers - no wonder they are such bad workers - and to wait for dark
nights to run the stuff down to the yard and load it on the train!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Your stepfather must make a lot of money
at this game,' said Dick to Jock.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Yes. That's why he can afford to pour
money into the farm,' said Jock, miserably. 'Poor Mum. This will break her
heart. All the same, I don't think my step-<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

somebody behind him.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Yes,' said Julian, thinking of the mean
little Mr Andrews, with his big nose and weak chin. 'There probably is. Now -
I've thought of something else. If this stuff is got rid of in any other way
except down the tunnel it came up, there must somewhere be a way out of these
caves!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'I believe you're right,' said George. 'And
if there is - we'll find it! And what's more, we'll escape that way!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Come on!' said Julian, and he switched off
the glaring light. 'Your torch will give enough light now. We'll try this cave
first. Keep your eyes open, all of you!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>The four children and Timmy went into the
big cave. They made their way round piles of boxes, chests and crates,
marvelling at the amount the men must have stolen from time to time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'These aren't man-made caves,' said Julian.
'They're natural. I expect the roof did perhaps fall in where the two tunnels
met, and the entrance between them was actually blocked up.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'But were two walls built then?' said Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Oh, no. We can't guess how it was that
this black market hiding-place came into existence,' said Julian, 'but it might
perhaps have been known there were caves here - and when someone came prospecting
along the tunnel one day, maybe they even found an old train buried under a
roof-fall or something like that.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'And resurrected it, and built another wall
secretly for a hiding-place - and used the train for their own purposes!' said
Dick. 'Made that secret entrance, too. How ingenious!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Or it's possible the place was built
during the last war,' said Julian. 'Maybe secret experiments were carried on
here - and given up afterwards. The place might have been discovered by the
black marketeers then, and used in this clever way. We can't tell!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>They had wandered for a good way in the
cave by now, without finding anything of interest beyond the<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>boxes and chests of all kinds of goods.
Then they came to where a pile was very neatly arranged, with numbers chalked
on boxes that were built up one on top of another. Julian halted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Now this looks as if these boxes were
about to be shifted off somewhere,' he said. 'All put in order and numbered.
Surely the exit must be somewhere here?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>He
took George's torch from her and flashed it all round. Then he found what he
wanted. The beam of light shone steadily on a strong roughly-made wooden door,
set in the wall of the cave. They went over to it in excitement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'This is what we want!' said Julian. 'I bet
this is the exit to some very lonely part of the moors, not far from a road
that lorries can come along to collect any goods carried out of here! There are
some very deserted roads over these moors, running in the middle of miles of lonely
moorland.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'It's a clever organisation,' said Dick.
'Lorries stored at an innocent farm, full of goods for hiding in the
tunnel-caves at a convenient time. The train comes out in the dark to collect
the goods, and takes them back here, till the hue and cry after the goods has
died down. Then out they go through this door to the moorlands, down to the
lorries which come to collect them and whisk them away to the black market!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'I told you how I saw Peters late one
night, locking up the barn, didn't I?' said Jock, excitedly. 'Well, he must
have got the lorry full of stolen goods then - and the next night he loaded
them on to the spook-train!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'That's about it,' said Julian, who had
been trying the door to see if he could open it. 'I say, this door's maddening.
I can't make it budge an inch. There's no lock that I can see.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>They all shoved hard, but the door would
not give at<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>all. It was very stout and strong, though
rough and unfinished. Panting and hot, the four of them at last gave it up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Do you know what I think?' said Dick. 'I
think the beastly thing has got something jammed hard against it on the
outside.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Sure to have, when you come to think of
it,' said Julian. 'It will be well hidden too - heather and bracken and stuff
all over it. Nobody would ever find it. I suppose the lorry-drivers come across
from the road to open the door when they want to collect the goods. And shut it
and jam it after them.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'No way of escape there, then,' said George
in disappointment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>' 'Fraid not,' said Julian. George gave a
sigh.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Tired, old thing?' Julian asked kindly.
'Or hungry?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Both, 'said George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Well, we've got some food somewhere,
haven't we?' said Julian. 'I remember one of the men slinging my bag in after
me. We've not had what we brought for tea yet. What about having a meal now? We
can't seem to escape at the moment.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Let's have it here,' said George. 'I
simply can't go a step further!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>They sat down against a big crate. Dick
undid his kit-bag. There were sandwiches, cake and chocolate. The four of them
ate thankfully, and wished they had something to wash down the food with.
Julian kept wondering about Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'I wonder what she did,' he said. 'She'd
wait and wait, I suppose. Then she might go back to the camp. But she doesn't
know the way very well, and she might get lost. Oh dear -1 don't know which
would be worse for Anne, being lost on the moor or a prisoner down here with
us!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Perhaps she's neither,' said Jock, giving
Timmy his last bit 01&quot; sandwich. 'I must say I'm jolly glad to have Timmy.
Honest, George, I couldn't believe it when I heard Tim whine, and then heard
your voice, too. I thought I must be dreaming.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>They sat where they were for a little
longer and then decided to go back to the tunnel where the train was. 'It's
just possible we might find the switch that works the Open-Sesame bit,' said
Julian. 'We ought to have looked before, really, but I didn't think of it.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>They went back to where the train stood silently
on its pair of lines. It seemed such an ordinary old train now that the
children couldn't imagine why they had ever thought it was strange and spooky.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>They switched on the light again, then they
looked about for any lever or handle that might perhaps open the hole in the
wall. There didn't seem to be anything at all. They tried a few switches, but
nothing happened.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Then George suddenly came across a big
lever low down in the brick wall itself. She tried to move it and couldn't. She
called Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Ju! Come here. I wonder if this has got
anything to do with opening that hole.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>The three boys came over to George. Julian
tried to swing the lever down. Nothing happened. He pulled it but it wouldn't
move. Then he and Dick pushed it upwards with all their strength.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>And hey presto, there came a bang from
somewhere, as something heavy shifted, and then a clanking as if machinery was
at work. Then came the sliding, grating noise and a great piece of the brick
wall moved slowly back, and then swung round sideways and stopped. The way of
escape was open!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Open Sesame!' said Dick, grandly, as the
hole appeared.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Better switch off the light here,' said
Julian. 'If there's anyone still in the tunnel they might see the reflection of
it on the tunnel-wall beyond, and wonder what it was.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>He stepped back and switched it off, and
the place was in darkness again. George put on her torch, and its feeble beam
lighted up the way of escape.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Come on,' said Dick, impatiently, and they
all crowded out of the hole. 'We'll make for Olly's Yard.' They began to make
their way down the dark tunnel.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Listen,' said Julian, in a low voice.
'We'd better not talk at all, and we'd better go as quietly as we can. We don't
know who may be in or out of this tunnel this evening. We don't want to walk
bang into somebody.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>So they said nothing at all, but kept close
to one another in single file, walking at the side of the track.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>They had not gone more than a quarter of a
mile before Julian stopped suddenly. The others bumped into one another, and
Timmy gave a little whine as somebody trod on his paw. George's hand went down
to his collar at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>The four of them and Timmy listened, hardly
daring to breathe. Somebody was coming up the tunnel towards them! They could
see the pin-point of a torch, and hear the distant crunch of footsteps.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Other way, quick!' whispered Julian, and
they all turned. With Jock leading them now, they made their way as quickly and
quietly as they could back to the place where the two tunnels met. They passed
it and went on towards Kilty's Yard, hoping to get out that way.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>But alas for their hopes, a lantern stood
some way down the tunnel there, and they did not dare to go on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>There might be nobody with the lantern-on
the other hand there might. What were they to do?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'They'll see that hole in the wall is
open!' suddenly said Dick. 'We left it open. They'll know we've escaped then.
We're caught again! They'll come down to find us, and here we'll be!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>They stood still, pressed close together,
Timmy growling a little in his throat. Then George remembered something!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Julian! Dick! We could climb up that vent
that I came down,' she whispered. 'The one poor old Timmy fell down. Have we
time?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Where is the vent?' said Julian, urgently.
'Quick find it.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>George tried to remember. Yes, it was on
the other side of the tunnel - near the place where the two tunnels met. She
must look for the pile of soot. How she hoped the little light from her torch
would not be seen. Whoever was coming up from Olly's Yard must be almost there
by now!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>She found the pile of soot that Timmy had
fallen into. 'Here it is,' she whispered. 'But, oh Julian! How can we take
Timmy?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'We can't,' said Julian, 'We must hope
he'll manage to hide and then slink out of the tunnel by himself. He's quite
clever enough.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>He pushed George up the vent first and her
feet found the first rungs. Then Jock went up, his nose almost on George's
heels. Then Dick - and last of all, Julian. But before he managed to climb the
first steps, something happened.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>A bright glare filled the tunnel, as
someone switched on the light that hung there. Timmy slunk into the shadows and
growled in his throat. Then there came a shout.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Who's opened the hole in the wall? It's
open! Who's there?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>It was Mr Andrews's voice. Then came
another voice, angry and loud: 'Who's here? Who's opened this place?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Those kids can't have moved the lever,'
said Mr Andrews. 'We bound them up tightly.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>The men, three of them, went quickly
through the hole in the wall. Julian climbed up the first few rungs thankfully.
Poor Timmy was left in the shadows at the bottom.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Out came the men at a run. 'They've gone!
Their ropes are cut! How could they have escaped? We put Kit down one end of
the tunnel and we've been walking up this end. Those kids must be about here
somewhere.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Or hiding in the caves,' said another
voice. 'Peters, go and look, while we hunt here.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>The men hunted everywhere. They had no idea
that the vent was nearby in the wall. They did not see the dog that slunk by
them like a shadow, keeping out of their way, and lying down whenever the light
from a torch came near hitn.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>George climbed steadily, feeling with her
feet for the iron nails whenever she came to broken rungs. Then she came to a
stop. Something was pressing on her head. What was it? She put up her hand to
feel. It was the collection of broken iron bars that Timmy had fallen on that
morning. He had dislodged some of them, and they had then fallen in such a way
that they had lodged across the vent, all twined into each other. George could
climb no higher. She tried to move the bars, but they were heavy and strong -
besides, she was afraid she might bring the whole lot on top of her and the
others. They might be badly injured then.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'There's some iron bars across the vent -
ones that must have fallen when Timmy fell,' said George. 'I can't go any
higher! I daren't pull too hard at the bars.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Jock passed the message to Dick, and he
passed it down to Julian. The four of them came to a full-stop!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>What indeed? The four of them hung there in
the darkness, hating the smell of the sooty old vent, miserably uncomfortable
on the broken rungs and nails.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>And now, what had happened to Anne? She had
stumbled on and on for a long time, shouting to Mr Luffy. And outside his tent
Mr Luffy sat, reading peacefully. But, as the evening came, and then darkness,
he became very worried indeed about the five children.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>He wondered what to do. It was hopeless for
one man to search the moors. Haifa dozen or more were needed for that! He
decided to get his car and go over to Olly's Farm to get the men from there. So
off he went.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>But when he got there he found no one at
home except Mrs Andrews and the little maid. Mrs Andrews looked bewildered and
worried.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'What is the matter?' said Mr Luffy gently,
as she came running out to the car, looking troubled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Oh, it's you, Mr Luffy,' she said, when he
told her who he was. 'I didn't know who you were. Mr Luffy, something strange
is happening. All the men have gone - and all the lorries, too. My husband has
taken the car and nobody will tell me anything. I'm so worried.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Mr Luffy decided not to add to her worries
by telling her the children were missing. He just pretended he had come to
collect some milk. 'Don't worry,' he said comfortingly to Mrs Andrews. 'You'll
find things are all right in the morning, I expect. I'll<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

an urgent matter.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>He went bumping along the road in his car,
puzzled. He had known there was something funny about Olly's Farm, and he had
puzzled his brains a good deal over Olly's Yard and the spook-trains. He hoped
the children hadn't got mixed up in anything dangerous.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'I'd better go down and report to the
police that they're missing,' he thought. 'After all, I'm more or less
responsible for them. It's very worrying indeed.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>He told what he knew at the police station,
and the sergeant, an intelligent man, at once mustered six men and a police
car.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

to find those kids,' he said. 'And we'll have to look into this Olly's Farm
business, sir, and these here spook-trains, whatever they may be. We've known
there was something funny going on, but we couldn't put our finger on it. But
we'll find the children first.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>They went quickly up to the moors and the
six men began to fan out to search, with Mr Luffy at the head. And the first
thing they found was Anne!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>She was still stumbling along, crying for
Mr Luffy, but in a very small, weak voice now. When she heard his voice calling
her in the darkness she wept for joy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Oh, Mr Luffy! You must save the boys,' she
begged him. 'They're in that tunnel - and they've been caught by Mr Andrews and
his men, I'm sure. They didn't come out and I waited and waited! Do come!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'I've got some friends here who will
certainly come and help,' said Mr Luffy gently. He called the men, and in a few
words told them what Anne had said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'In the tunnel?' said one of them. 'Where
the spook-trains run? Well, come on, men, we'll go down there.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'You stay behind, Anne,' said Mr Luffy. But
she<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>wouldn't. So he carried her as he followed
the men who were making their way through the heather, down to Olly's Yard.
They did not bother with Wooden-Leg Sam. They went straight to the tunnel and
walked up it quietly. Mr Luffy was a good way behind with Anne. She refused to
stay with him in the yard.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'No,' she said, Tm not a coward. Really I'm
not. I want to help to rescue the boys. I wish George was here. Where's
George?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Mr Luffy had no idea. Anne clung to his
hand, scared but eager to prove that she was not a coward. Mr Luffy thought she
was grand!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Meanwhile, Julian and the others had been
in the vent for a good while, tired and uncomfortable. The men had searched in
vain for them and were now looking closely into every niche at the sides of the
tunnel.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>And, of course, they found the vent! One of
the men shone his light up it. It shone on to poor Julian's feet! The man gave
a loud shout that almost made Julian fall off the rung he was standing on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Here they are! Up this vent. Who'd have
thought it? Come on down or it'll be the worse for you!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Julian didn't move. George pushed
desperately at the iron bars above her head, but she could not move them. One
of the men climbed up the vent and caught hold of Julian's foot.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>He dragged so hard at it that the boy's
foot was forced off the rung. Then the man dragged off the other foot, and
Julian found himself hanging by his arms with the man tugging hard at his feet.
He could hang on no longer. His tired arms gave way and he fell heavily down,
landing half on the man and half on the pile of soot. Another man pounced on
Julian at once, while the first climbed up the vent to find the next boy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Soon Dick felt his feet being tugged at,
too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'All right, all right. I'll come down!' he
yelled, and climbed down. Then Jock climbed down, too. The men looked at them
angrily.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Giving us a chase like this! Who undid
your ropes?' said Mr Andrews, roughly. One of the men put a hand on his arm and
nodded up towards the vent. 'Someone else is coming down,' he said. 'We only
tied up three boys, didn't we? Who's this, then?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>It was George, of course. She wasn't going

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Another boy!' said the men. 'Where did he
come from?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Any more up there?' asked Mr Andrews.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Look and see,' said Julian, and got a box

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

They were terrified to find a big animal growling and snapping all around them.
Timmy held them at bay in the tunnel, riot allowing them to go one step
further, snapping at any man who dared to go near.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

dare call him a dog's paw! That would be too good a name for him!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Well, I don't think I ever in my life saw
dirtier children,' said Mr Luffy. 'I vote we all go back to my car and I drive
the lot of you over to Olly's Farm for a meal and a bath!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>So back they all went, tired, dirty, and
also feeling very thrilled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>What a night! They told Anne all that had
happened, and she told them her story, too. She almost fell asleep in the car
as she talked, she was so tired.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Mrs Andrews was sensible and kind, though
upset to hear that her husband had been taken off by the police. She got hot
water for baths, and laid a meal for the hungry children.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'I wouldn't worry overmuch, Mrs Andrews,'
said kindly Mr Luffy. 'That husband of yours needs a lesson, you know. This
will probably keep him going straight in future. The farm is yours, and you can
now hire proper farm-workers who will do what you want them to do. And I think
Jock will be happier without a stepfather for the present.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'You're right, Mr Luffy,' said Mrs Andrews,
wiping her eyes quickly. 'Quite right. I'll let Jock help me with the farm, and
get it going beautifully. To think that Mr Andrews was in with all those black
marketeers! It's that friend of his, you know, who makes<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>him do all this. He's so weak. He knew Jock
was snooping about in that tunnel, and that's why he wanted him to go away -
and kept making him have a boy here or go out with him. I knew there was
something funny going on.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'No wonder he was worried when Jock took it
into his head to go and camp with our little lot,' said Mr Luffy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'To think of that old yard and tunnel being
used again!' said Mrs Andrews. 'And all those tales about spook-trains - and
tha way they hid that train, and hid all the stuff, too. Why, it's like a fairy
tale isn't it!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>She ran to see if the water was hot for the
baths. It was, and she went to call the children, who were in the big bedroom
next door. She opened it and looked in. Then she called Mr Luffy upstairs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>He looked in at the door, too. The five,
and Timmy, were lying on the floor in a heap, waiting for the bathwater. They
hadn't liked to sit on chairs or beds, they were so dirty. And they had fallen
asleep where they sat, their faces as black as a sweep's.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Talk about black marketeers!' whispered Mrs
Andrews. 'Anyone would think we'd got the whole lot of them here in the
bedroom!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>They all woke up and went to have a bath
one by one, and a good meal after that. Then back to camp with Mr Luffy, Jock
with them, too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>It was glorious to snuggle down into the
sleeping-bags. George called out to the three boys.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Now don't you dare to go off without me
tonight, see?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'The adventure is over,' called back Dick.
'How did you like it, Jock?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>'Like it?' said Jock, with a happy sigh.
'It was simply - smashing!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>
