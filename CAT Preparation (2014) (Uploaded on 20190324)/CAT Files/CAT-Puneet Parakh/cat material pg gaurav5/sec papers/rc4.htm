      Passage &#150;1<br>
      <br>
      In its more extreme forms perseution mania is a recognised form of insanity. 
      Some people imagine that others wish to kill them, or imprison them, or 
      to do them some other grave injury. Often the wish to protect themselves 
      against imaginary persecutors leads them into acts of violence which make 
      it necessary to restrain their liberty. This, like many other forms of insanity, 
      is only an exaggeration of a tendency not at all uncommon among people who 
      count as normal. I do not propose to discuss the extreme forms, which are 
      a matter for a psychiatrist. It is the milder forms that I wish toconsider, 
      because they are a very frequent cause of unhappiness, and because, not 
      having gone so far as toe produce definite insanity, they are still capable 
      of being dealt with by the patient himself, provided he can be induced to 
      diagnose the trouble rightly and to see that its origin lies within himself 
      and not in the supposed hostility or unkindness of others.</font></p>
  </div><div align="left"><p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">We are all familiar with
  the type of person, man or woman, who according to his own account, is perpetually the
  victim of ingratitude, unkindness, and treachery. People of this kind are often
  extraordinarily plausible, and secure warm sympathy from those who have not known them
  long, There is, as a rule, nothing inherently improbable about each separate story that
  they relate. The kind of ill-treatment of which they complain does undoubtedly sometimes
  occur. What in the end rouses the hearer&#146;s suspicions is the multiplicity of villains
  whom it has been the sufferer&#146;s ill-fortune to meet with.</font></p>
  </div><div align="left"><p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In accordance with the
  doctrine of probability, different people living in a given society are likely in the
  course of their lives to meet with about the same amount of bad treatment. Of one person
  in a given set receives, according to his own account, universal ill-treatment, the
  likelihood is that the cause lies in himself, and that the either imagines injuries from
  which in fact he has not suffered, or unconsciously behaves in such a way as to arouse
  uncontrollable irritation. Experienced people therefore becomes suspicious of those who by
  their own account are invariable ill-treated by the world; they tend, by their lack of
  sympathy, to confirm these unfortunate people in the view that everyone is against them.
  The trouble, in fact is a difficult one to deal with, since it is inflamed alike by
  sympathy and by lack of sympathy. The person inclined to persecution mania, when he finds
  a hard-luck story believed, will embellish it until he reaches the frontier of
  credibility; when, on the other had, he finds it disbelieved, he has merely another
  example of the peculiar hard-heartedness, and this understanding , and this understanding
  must be conveyed to the patient if its is to serve its purpose.&nbsp;</font></p>

  </div><div align="left"><p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">After singing for their
  supper, bees sleep soundly. When they hover around, sucking fluid from hibiscus flowers
  during the day, their wings beat about 60 times a second.</font></p>
  </div><div align="left"><p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">An expenditure led by
  Dr.John Joseph from the University of Aarhus in Denmark went to Brazil to see how bees
  manage their energy supplies. It concentrated on the grounds of the Biological Museum in
  Santa Teresa, 500 kilometers north of Rio de Janeiro.</font></p>
  </div><div align="left"><p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The park boasts of 3,200
  wild bees from 15 species, including the tiny Lophornis Magnifica, whose name refers to
  its green, red, and white plumange rather than its size. Its body would fir onto this
  paragraph with room to spare.</font></p>
  </div><div align="left"><p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">They found that a
  hovering ten-gram bees used about half a liter of oxygen every hour. In terms of oxygen
  per gram, that is about ten times the amount an energetic person might use up in the same
  time. To pump all this oxygen around its body a bees&#146; heartbeat has to be high &#150;
  about 1,440 beats per minute, compared to around 110 for an exercising human. The oxygen
  is used to burn up food, making the energy that keeps the bird warm and powers its wings.
  Eating lets it hover, and hovering lets it eat.</font></p>
  </div><div align="left"><p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">During the day such an
  energetic metabolism keeps a bees&#146; body temperature at about 40° c. But the bees
  cannot store enough food in their tiny bodies to keep their temperature that high all
  night. So, at night L. Magnifica slows its metabolism enough to cut its body temperature
  by 20-30° c. It may breathe around 50-100 times less oxygen than during the day, which
  means that it uses by 50-100 times less food. It works well, but it does mean that waking
  up is hard to do.</font></p>
  </div><div align="left"><p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Dr. Joseph found that the
  bees uses almost as much oxygen shivering itself awake in the morning as it does when
  hovering. It takes the bees about 15-20 minutes to raise its temperature back up to is
  day-time level &#150; all the time using up energy. With only small food reserves, the
  bees &#150; especially small ones like L. Magnifica &#150; sometimes get only one chance
  to wake up. If they nod off again, they sleep the sleep of the dead.<br>
