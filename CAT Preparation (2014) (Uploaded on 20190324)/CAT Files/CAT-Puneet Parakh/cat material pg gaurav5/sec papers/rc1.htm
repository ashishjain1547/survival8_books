    </b><p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The most complex script is
      Japanese. It consists of a long series of tricky picture characters,
      ideograms, which symbolize ideas and objects derived from Japanese life
      and culture. In ancient times the writing was practised as an skill from,
      studied and guarded by selected scholars. It is beautiful, hard to learn,
      and represents the discipline of scholarship and the delightful dedication
      of Japanese writers to this day. Japanese children learn to write their
      languages all the time they are in school, but very few of them are able
      to complete the task before they leave. Yet some literacy scholars are
      persuaded that no one system is more difficult to learn to read and write
      than any other. Whether or not this is the case, to learn to write always
      involves practice with a tool which has to be brought under control so
      that the writer can concentrate on putting together the message rather
      than on the creation of the sign. </font></p>

      </b><p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I do not appreciate of
        forbiddance by law. According to me, it is a worthless attempt at a
        self-arrogated virtue. Wine is as old as gods and it has come down to us
        through ages and scriptures as the supreme soothe for the human agony.
        It is our legacy of an age when gods were mortal and men were divine,
        and though wine has been accursed as an hateful evil since its first sip
        by man, he has not stopped drinking at its bubbling fountain of vice and
        forgetfulness. A nation that needs legislation to maintain the virtue of
        its people is really unfortunate. Saints have preached great sermons on
        the immoral of drinking but this Christian scriptures of the saints has
        always remained a bad sermon in the world of sinners. It is good for the
        saints to preach but stupid for the state to enforce that preaching, for
        what is enforced by law ceases to be moral. A virtue is a virtue only
        when it is acquired through self-realisation, not when is is pushed on
        the lives of the people. Every new law creates a new group of
        law-breakers and one more sin is added to the sum-total of human crimes.

        scarcely worth, the sentinel.</font></p>

      have attained? Truthful answers to these questions should go to clearly
      fix the aim of the meeting. The manner the aim is percieved by the group
      will to a large extent determine the effectiveness of the meeting. Next,
      identifying members who need to attend to achieve the defined purpose is
      equally crucial. Frequently people who have no role whatsoever are asked
      to join in a meeting to give the appearance of a ‘full room’. This
      could spell disaster since other participants who are determined to attain

      issue under consideration in a thematic manner. If the differing stands of
      any groups are known in advance, the agenda must be drawn to accommodate
      these, so that everyone gets an opportunity to speak out his opinion.

      <b><p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Passage- 4</font></p>
      </b><p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Let’s try to be clear
        as to what religion isn’t.<b> </b>Firstly, it isn’t morality. It isn’t
        being good or doing good. Many atheists have been exceptionally virtuous
        people, and many genuinely religious people have been exceptionally
        weaked. This does not mean that religion isn’t concerned about our
        behaviour. Of course it is: in fact, it adds its own severer penalties
        to those which nature and society impose upon the offender. More serious
        still, bad behaviour- even ordinary, respectable self-seeking – upsets
        a religious man’s relationship with the Divine, and is apt to leave
        him weak and lonely and miserable. Nevertheless, religion isn’t matter
        of how we act outwardly but rather of the inner attitude from which our
        behaviour springs. For instance, Ram and Sheela can do precisely the
        same thing in the same way (such as giving their lives to save a
        drowning man) yet the inside story is quite different. Sheela acts out
        of a sense of social duty or humanitarian compassion, whereas Ram may
        act from a motive which means nothing to Sheela – from a love for God
        which is necessarily love for all God’s creatures, or even
        identification with them. Ram feels he is that drowning man.</font></p>

        animal in the forests, that grew around the Mediterranean eight thousand
        years ago was the great reindeer. It stood six foot high at the
        shoulders and weighed about a ton. Apart from eye-witness account we
        know their dimensions from their fossilised bones and, more importantly,
        their appearance from the superb portraits of them painted by
        prehistoric man, particularly in the cave of Lascaux in Central France.
        It is possible that the act of painting played a part in the rituals
        designed to bring success in hunting and to ensure the continued
        fertility of the creatures on which people depended for food. Opposed to
        this is the view that at the time the paintings were made, the game was
        so abundant that magic was hardly required to find it. Whatever the
        differing views about the reindeers’ role in the ritual, it is clear
        that by 8000 BC at the eastern end of the Mediterranean Sea, the
        reindeer had dominated the minds of the men who held it great respect.
        In Catal Huyuk in Central turkey, one of the earliest big towns to have
        developed around 6400 years age, the excavator found in several shrines
        reindeer’s heads modelled in clay protruding from the walls. It is not
        certain that the people of Catal Huyuk offered the reindeer for
        sacrifice but their domestication led to the reduction of reindeers’
        size, both in body and in horns. But it is Memphis, capital of ancient
        Egypt around 2000BC that the reindeer commanded the highest respect,
        taking its place among other important deities in all Egypt. </font></p>

        <li>
          <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The very first line of
          the passage describes the Japanese script as a long series of tricky
          pictures known as ideograms. Therefore, this is the only true
          statement amongst the given options. Hence, the answer is [1]</font></li>
        <li>
          <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Japanese script
          symbolizes ideas and objects rooted in the Japanese way of life and
          culture. So one needs to study Japanese civilisation in order to learn
          the script. Hence, the answer is [2]</font></li>
        <li>
          <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The reasons for the slow
          learning of the Japanese script are described in the passage where it
          is stated that the script is complicated, difficult to learn and
          requires dedication and aesthetic devotion if at all it is to be
          mentioned. Lack of proficient teachers to teach the script is not
          cited as a reason for slow learning anywhere. Hence, the answer is [4]</font></li>
        <li>
          <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The passage is about the
          challenges posed by the script which results in the slow learning rate
          of the script. It logically follows that if the script were to be
          simplified it would spread fast. Hence the answer is [1]</font></li>
        <li>
          <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the case of Japanese
          writing, it is very important to concentrate equally on form and
          meaning because the form is quite complicated and requires a lot of
          practice. So form and meaning become equally significant and this is
          the greatest challenge posed by Japanese writing. Hence, the answer is
          [3]</font></li>
      </ol>
      <p align="left"><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Passage- 2</font></b></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">6. The argument of the
      author is based on the premise that the nation-state has arrogated
      morality by trying to become the moral police of its citizens. ‘Prohibition
      by law is an example of this. Hence, the answer is [3]</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">7. The author’s quotation
      at the end of the para states that virtue which needs a watch man from
      outside cannot be called as virtue, therefore the sentinel needs to be
      discarded as virtue can only be a virtue when it is achieved without help
      of any outside agency, i.e. through self-realisation. So the answer is [4]</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">8. The pasage assumes that
      it is the government who wishes to enforce prohibition in the nation. But
      it neglects the fact that public opinion for/against a certain issue is
      also a powerful driving force for government to frame laws of public
      concern. So the answer is [1]</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">9. According to line 7 of
      the passage, the answer is [4]</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">10. Option 3 is the exact
      opposite of what Goldsmith means in the quotation. See the explanation
      for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">11. The ultimate
      effectiveness of the Meeting lies in the manner in which each participant
      perceives the goals and aims for which it has been convened. Hence, the
      answer is [2].</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">12. Unwanted invitees to the
      meeting will waste their own as well as others’ time and will demoralise
      the serious candidates who really wish to make a contribution. Hence, the
      answer is [4].</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">13. According to the author,
      a well-set agenda helps make visible the path that leads to the
      achievement of the goal and allows space for differing goals of the group
      in advance. It does not clarify the goals of each and every member. Hence,
      the answer is [4].</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">14. According to the author,
      a facilitator has to guide the discussions on the right track, to allow
      for different view-points to emerge and space them thematically. Hence,
      the answer is [4].</font></p>
      <p align="left"><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Passage- 4</font></b></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">15. A man may be religious,
      but if he misbehaves he upsets his relationship with his
      Maker.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Hence,[3]</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">16. Sentence 4 states that
      when man indulges in bad behavior he upsets his relationship with his
      Maker and feels weak, lonely. This does not imply that whenever he feels
      so he has indulged in bad behavior. His negative feelings may have been
      caused by some other reasons. Hence, [2]</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">17. Acts if selflessness may
      be prompted by either social duty or humanitarian compassion or from a
      love of God which is necessarily love of god’s creatures, as proved
      respectively in Sheela and Ram’s example. Hence, [2]</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">18. In the author’s
      opinion bad behavior must also include ordinary, respectable, and
      self-seeking behavior. Hence, [2]</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">19. According to the author,
      religion is not merely how we act outwardly but is is also concerned with
      that inner attitude from which our behavior springs. Hence, [2]</font></p>
