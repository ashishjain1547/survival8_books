PARALLELOGRAM		- 2 sets of parallel sides
                      	- 2 sets of congruent sides
                      	- opposite angles congruent
                      	- consecutive angles supplementary
                      	- diagonals bisect each other
                     	- diagonals form 2 congruent triangles
