-----------------------------------
A rich man died. In his will, he has divided his gold coins among his 5 sons, 5 daughters and a manager. According to his will: First give one coin to manager. 1/5th of the remaining to the elder son. Now give one coin to the manager and 1/5th of the remaining to second son and so on..... After giving coins to 5th son, divided the remaining coins among five daughters equally. All should get full coins. Find the minimum number of coins he has?

I need to know , is it possible to get the solution in easiest way?

Manager = 5 coins
First son = 624 coins
 Second son = 499 coins
 Third son = 399 coins
 Forth son = 319 coins
 Fifth son = 255 coins
 Daughters = 204 *5 

Total = 3121 coins

A group of friends went on a holiday to a hill station. It rained for 13 days. But when it
rained in the morning, the afternoon was lovely. And when it rained in the afternoon, the
day was preceded by clear morning.
Altogether there were 11 very nice mornings and 12 very nice afternoons. How many days did
their holiday last?

The ratio of Boys to Girls is 6:4. 60% of the boys and 40% of the girls take lunch in the
canteen. What % of class takes lunch in canteen?

Which of the following day(s) can't be the last day of a century? Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday.

-----------------------------------

The ratio of Boys to Girls is 6:4. 60% of the boys and 40% of the girls take lunch in the canteen. What % of class takes lunch in canteen? 
 
 
I think the answer for this should be 52%, Total Students 10x Students taking food in canteen = 3.6x + 1.6 x = 5.2 x

Hence 52%

For other questions wait for some time

day was preceded by clear morning.
Altogether there were 11 very nice mornings and 12 very nice afternoons. How many days did
their holiday last?

Let the number of total mornings be M and the number of total afternoons be E
The wet mornings must be M-11 and the horrid afternoons are E-12
So, M-11+E-12=13 or M+E = 36
but M+E is one day so the number of days must be 18!

-----------------------------------

Which of the following day(s) can't be the last day of a century? Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday.

Ans: 
easiest one.

The last day of a century can not be Tuesday, Thursday or Saturday.
( hope everybody aware of calendar probs. 5317 - fri,wed,mon,sun alone be the last days of centuries)

Here it goes.
 
A normal year has 365 days whereas a leap year has 366 days. Every year which is divisible by 4 is called a leap year. 
Also, every 4th century is a leap year but no other century is a leap year. 
1 normal year = 365 days = 52 weeks + 1 day 
1 leap year = 366 days = 52 weeks + 2 day

 Thus, a normal year has 1 odd day whereas a leap year has 2 odd days. 
100 years = 76 normal years + 24 leap years = 76*[52 weeks + 1 day] + 24*[52 weeks + 2 day] = (76*52) weeks + 76 days + (24*52) weeks + 48 days = 5200 weeks + 124 days = 5217 weeks + 5 days

 i.e. 100 years contain 5 odd days 
Similarly, 200 years contain 10 odd days
 i.e. 3 odd days. 300 years contain 15 odd days
 i.e. 1 odd days.

400 years contain (20+1) odd days i.e. 0 odd days.

 Note that 400 years contain one more leap year.

 Also, we have Sunday for 0 odd day, Monday for 1 odd day, Tuesday for 2 odd days, and so on... Thus, last day of first century is Friday. (5 odd days) Last day of second century is Wednesday. (3 odd days) Last day of third century is Monday. (1 odd days)
 Last day of forth century is Sunday. (0 odd days) 

Since the order is repeating in successive cycles, the last day of a century can not be Tuesday, Thursday or Saturday.

A ship went on a voyage.
After it had travelled 180 miles a plane statrted with 10 times the speed of the ship.
Find the distance when they meet from starting point.

--------------------------------
200 miles

soln. :-) yes i 2 worked
-----------------------------------
200 miles

 200 miles

Let's say the ship is travelling v mi/hr
and plane took t hours to meet the ship

Than, vt is the distance ship travelled after plane started
(10v)t = 10vt is the distance plane travelled.

So we have, vt + 180 = 10vt
or 9vt = 180
or vt = 20

Hence distance ==> 180 + 20 = 200 miles


But.... :mg:  one more soln. with me.

By the time the plane flies 180 miles the ship would have travelled 18 miles.

180 + 18 = 198 miles

By the time the plane flies 18 miles the ship would have travelled 1.8 miles.

198 + 1.8 = 199.8 miles

By the time the plane flies 1.8 miles the ship would have travelled .18 miles.

199.8 + .18 = 199.98 miles

By the time the plane flies .18 miles the ship would have travelled .018 miles.

199.98 + .018 = 199.998 miles

By the time the plane flies .018 miles the ship would have travelled .0018 miles.

199.998 + .0018 = 199.9988

And so on, assuming the plane never tries to overtake the ship  :idea:

rel dis = 180
rel speed = 10x - x = 9x
time = 180/9x = 20/x

Ans = Dis Travelled by plane = 10x * 20/x = 200 miles

.9x - 30 days
1 x - 30*.9 days = 27 days for 12 chicken
                            = 9 days for t chicken
                            = 27 * 12 days for 1 chicken
                            = 27 * 12 / 9 days for t chicken
t = 27*12/9 = 36 chicken initially.

There is an element which triplicates in every hour. Each of these 3
items inturn reproduce exactly 3 other items. If a single compund is kept in a
container at noon and the container is full by midnight. After how many hours is the container 1/3 full.
9 pm.or 9 hours (1/3 becomes 3/3 in 3 hours - therefore 12-3 = 9) - not very sure - have to check.

100 Kg. Potatoes with 98% water content are dried in an oven. The percentage of water decreases to 50 %. What is the weight of potatoes now.
98 kg + 2kg of solid matter of water becomes 2 kg of water + 2 kg of solid matter (2 = 50% of 4) (assuming 50% of original weight - if it is 50% of the weight of water - then it will be 49kg water + 2kg solid = 51kg - but then the wording should have been "The percentage of water decreases by 50 %" )

There are n Railway stations. Ticket facility is 10available between every
two stations. Recently, m new stations are bulit so that 42 new tickets
are to be printed. How many stations were there? How many are newly
constructed.
For the m new stations you will need to print 42 new tickets = 21 new tickets one way.
Now, 21 = trains between 1 each of n stations and 1 of m stations = m*n + trains between each of the m new stations = mC2
21 = m*n+mC2 = m(2n + m-1)/2
3*7 = m(2n+m-1)/2
Taking m = 3
7 = (2n+3-1)/2
14 = 2n + 2
n = 6

If we take m = 7, (2n+6) = 6 => n = 0
Therefore, either there were no stations initially and 7 new stations were added or 6 originally, 3 new were added.

n(n-1) is the no. of tickets available between n no. of stations.

therefor n1(n1-1) - n(n-1) =42

Koolfriend: i think the paper will be set such that they will explicitly mention any such criteria. since you are going to be answering an objective paper - if options are such that they can have multiple answers - then chose the best answer - perhaps in this case 6 & 3.

station.The speed of cyclist   is  12mph. Find the speed of the train. 

->time to cover 5 miles at 12mph = 5/12 hrs = 25 minutes
Given that the cylist was 20 minutes late, he would have arrived at the station in 5 minutes, if he were not late. So the train has been travelling for 5 minutes.
5 minutes = 5 miles => 1 hr = 60miles
therefore train speed = 60mph

i guess u r lookibng for positive integral solution ...
 if u r ...
 then do it this way 
 solve for a and b in terms of c
 u will get a=4/3c-100 , b=200-7/3c
now since we looking for intergral solutions c is a multiple of 3 
 also since a and b are positive c>75 and c<86
now the only muliples of 3 in this set 78 81 84 
hence possible values of c are 78 81 84 

giving u 3 sets of solution

this is a diophantine equation. we might not need another equation, but we need a criterion like 'all the numbers are positive integers' and so on.
In which case, we have a+b+c=100 and 15a+9b+c=300
or, 14a+8b=200; 7a+4b=100
so, a=(100-4b)/7
the son. set is (12,4), (8,11), (4, 18) 
for each of these, c hasa a value; so the soln set is (12,4, 84), (8,11, 81), (4, 18, 78) 

all three are valid solutions for the equations given by you koolfriend!

mr. x (got paramvir chakra in 1981) died when his age was 1/59th the year of birth. what was his date of birth? 

quite clearly from the problem It should be of the form 59k and around 1981.
if u think of 59 approx. to 60 then clearly u can see that k should be less than 40 and greater than 30.
so i start with 59*30=1770
clearly to make it to 19xx i need to add 59*3=177 which takes it to 1947.
SO he was born in 1947 lived 33 yrs and died in 1980  :wink:

there can be 0,1,2 or 3 females in the grp
and you need to calculate for only 2 cases either the first 2 or the last 2 and then double it get ur answer (easy enough to understand :wink: )

so when there are 3 females  the group can be selected in 4 ways
when there are 2girls they can be selected in 4C2 for females *2 ways for guys =12
so final answer (12+4)*2=32.

I think for such problems it's best to go for the elimination method, since these are multiple choice questions. any thoughts?

Re: Problem on Numbers

87! - 60! = 60!(61*62*...87 -1)

61*62...*87 -1 is not divisible by 3.

hence 28 is the answer!

Hi
Another approach will be to equate the time taken by the ship and airplane after the plane has started...
Therefore
(x-180)/v = x/10v
x-total distance the airplane has to travel
v-speed of the ship
