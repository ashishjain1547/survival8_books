First of all good show in setting up something as huge as this..

anyways here goes..

1. How is life at IIM-A like?
 Many ppl must have already told you this, IT IS TOUGH. But
definitely worth it. So stop thinking abt whether the place is worth
the effort that you would be reequired to put in ..because no
amount of effort is too much to get here. The kind of people you
will get to interact with ( students and profs) is amazing. All the
facilities are provided but you will just not have the time to use
them. So if you can kiss enjoyment away for an year .. my advice
would be go for it.

2. What should be the strategy of preparation for CAT at this time
when only around 80 days are left ?
 This question depends on what stage your preparation is. If you
havent started yet, you have an uphill task ahead but it is still
possible. My advice would be to join the TIME test
series...sincerely speaking they are too good.. Take material (
IMS or there is another called PAGE).. keep doing as much
material as possible and do these tests. Most important analyze
the tests that you do, because that is the only way you can
improve.

3. How to attack the Mock tests (strategies to be adopted while
attempting the papers) ?
Choose your strength section and do it first. This will give you a
safe feeling. something like money in a bank. Once you know
you have it in your kitty you will become a little more bold. but
then everybody has a diff strategy. I used to start with quant for 30
min, verbal for 45 min and DI for 30 min. then depending on
which of quant and verbal is easier , i wud do that in the last 15
min.


4. How to select the proper questions to attempt ?
It is very intuitive and can be gained only by practice and more
practice. Generally I tended to choose questions that were
shorter as the time wasted in doing the problem is smaller if i
dont get the problem. RC's I would select 3 or 4 out of the 5 and
do them . generally the RCs were selected on basis of my
familiarity and the concreteness of the topic

5. How to gain maximum out of the mock tests ?
 Do the tests sincerely. dont cheat. and dont throw away the
paper when you are done. go back home. sit down and analyze
the paper for atleast 3 hours. see what questions you missed
and why you missed them. see the solution and see how your
solution is longer than their solution.

6. My performance at Mock was :
TIME AIMCAT.. rank was in the top 20 for 18 of the 20 tests I
wrote.

7. Tips for tackling CAT, GD/PI :
CAT: keep your cool. it is a crackable paper. search for the easy
question. most important stay cool.
GD:Dont worry abt it now.. do your cat well

Best of Luck to all UrPercentile Members.

hi,

here are the answer to your queries.

1. Life at IIMA
i think u are not in a position to know much about IIMA. still if u
need, showing u just a window- come to IIMA if u hv the urge to
excel among the best, if u can face the extreme pressure, if u can
work constantly and still say i m enjoying life. thats IIMA- very
demanding, very competitive but deserving to be the best. after
all not everyone enters here.

2. What should be the strategy of preparation for CAT at this time
when only around 80 days are left ?
its not 80 days- just 80*4 hrs left. u need 2 hrs of mock cat and
2 hrs analysis everyday. thats the key- practise and practise. not
just ur coaching insti..but appear on your own. in ur room.

3. How to attack the Mock tests (strategies to be adopted while
attempting the papers) ?

highly person specific- thats what u hv to determine in these 80
days- ur strength. experiment with the order and figure out ur
best order. but yes. show competence across all fields.thats
what people dont do.

4. How to select the proper questions to attempt ?

the best way is to attempt maths in 2 stages- first 15 mins for
finding and solving those 15 damn easy qns.....they are always
there. in next 25 mins try to gain the max out of difficult ones. DI
is all about finding perfecttion in %, * --thats it. take any qn- if u
can take % quickly u can solve anything. and RC is all person
specific- but read a lot ....everything that u come accross....ET,
HT, even stardust...anything in english..that will surely help.

5. How to gain maximum out of the mock tests ?
There is a catch. its damn easy to appear for mock cat, what
matters is whether u hv done the analysis of at least 2 hrs of that
paper. try to figure out ur mistakes, wrong qns chosen, easy qns
that u left, ur order, ur strength, ur weekness and above all ur
time mgmt- and improve it in next mock. spend time with ur
paper.

6. My performance at Mock was :
forget it ..that was pathetic. i started preparing too late. thanks to
uncle don. i got dec, jan and feb, when i took the edge by working
on my own in library. but i got peak just 3 days before actual
exam.

7. Tips for tackling CAT, GD/PI :
leave GD/Pi..i will let u clear it very easily...but first crack CAT......
only three words sums up the key to success- Speed, selection
and accuracy. forget the world around for these 80 days. just hv
confidence....no one can stop u then.

1. How is life at IIM-A  like?
 hectic...very demanding...you got to be on your toes all the time...
and also lots of fun...you have gotto be here to know what it is
like!!!!

2. What should be the strategy of preparation for CAT at this time
when only around 80 days are left ?
revise all the fundamentals regularly...do the mock tests
dilligently..esp the section wise mock tests..do not worry if u are
not scoring well...the mock caselets given by the coaching instis
are usually tougher than the CAT u will be writing...esp the ones
of career forum,time & career plan. if possible & if u have the
time, try going  thru the tests of diff coaching insties. they will give
u a broader outlook.. also always attempt the mock tests under
properly simulated exam conditions..WITHOUT ANY BREAKS IN
BETWEEN....try doing them in a group or in the coaching
institutes.. doing them alone at home does not give you the
same feel..also never miss attempting any of these mock
exams..they are important...the techniques that u will think of
while attempting questions under pressure  are the real take-
aways.

3. How to attack the Mock tests (strategies to be adopted while
attempting the papers) ?
use the mock cats as a tool to identify ur weak areas and try
devotingg more time to them...always keep the time factor in
mind..the mock tests will help u in formulating a stratergy for the
CAT as in how much time u need to devote to each section of the
paper in order to get the min cut-offs( they actually exist...but not
for all the IIMs..) required to get   6/6 GD/PI  calls.. but most
importantly, what the mock CATs teach u is how to be cool &
calm during the 2.5 hr exam. when u write CAT after writing the
mock CATs frequently, u feel as if u are just writing another Mock
CAT...that is the greatest help that these exams provide.

4. How to select the proper questions to attempt ?
again...do whatever u feel comfortable with first. always
remember to scan the paper initially the moment u receive it
...the two minutes u spend in doing so will save u a lot of time
and anxiety as to how familiar the paper...if u are regular in ur
mock Cats, there will be quite a few ques that u can identify...this
will give u the confidence to proceed...so stratergies will vary
from individual to individual...always remember that what works
for ur frien may not work for you..also never let the results of the
Mock CATs bother you..in the end it is how you perform during
those 2.5hrs on "THAT" day  that really counts


5. How to gain maximum out of the mock tests ?
i think i have covered this query in the above questions


6. My performance at Mock was : always average...used to stand
30th..or likewise inthe carrer forum rankings...generally 97
percentile or likewise i guess ...used to consistently clear the
cut-offs...and yes..."never missed any of the tests" come what
may..even if that entitled going directly frm my office to the centre
and ...without eating lunch or dinner...

7. Tips  for  tackling CAT, GD/PI : Be cool....dnt let anything fazzle
you...that is what they are looking for...if you loose your calm, you
will not be able to put in your very best work hard , do your best
and leave the rest to God/luck whatever...

also all the best to all of you!!!!
