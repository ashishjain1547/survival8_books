REGARDS
RAHUL SINHA
INTERNAL AUDIT 
SENIOR INTERNAL AUDITOR,
ASHOK LEYLAND
MO.NO:04432829344
Being defeated is often a temporary condition. Giving up is what 
makes it permanent.

Q1
Digging into their own pockets to help a once-powerful retailer, 
several large toy manufacturers are releasing a battery of holiday 
toys to be sold exclusively at ABC stores -- and footing the bill to 
advertise them on television. The unusual show of support from 
suppliers -- including Mattel Inc., Hasbro Inc., Leap Frog 
Enterprises Inc. and Lego AG ? comes as ABC sets out on what 
could be its last Christmas under its current ownership. Name 
ABC.
 
Toys R Us. In August, facing shrinking profits and slowing sales, 
Toys "R" Us ran out of time in its years-long market-share battle 
with Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and put its flagship chain of 1,200 toy 
stores on the auction block, pursuing one of several options.
 
Q2
It hasn't lived up to its original promise. It was conceived as a 
diversified companywith TV, film, music and videogame 
divisions but only computer generated movies have paid off. 
Now its looks like as if the founders and their investors are trying 
to cash out while their digital movies are getting good buzz. 
Which company?
 
DreamWorks Studios
 
Q3
Its CEO did killer Elvis imitations and its flight attendants had 
passengers rolling in the aisles. The airline was built on a 
culture of fun. That worked so well that it became USA's biggest 
carrier in terms of passengers and has the largest market cap. It 
has also been a major inspiration to other low-cost airlines, and 
its business model has been copied countless times around 
the world. Europe's easyJet and Ryanair are two of the best 
known clones on the other side of the Atlantic. Which airline?
 
Southwest
 
Q4
It has more of a blue-collar clientele though its CEO is a former 
Harvard  professor and still lives in Cambridge, Mass. It owns or 
manages through various subsidiaries 28 X's in the United 
States, and its goal is to provide great customer service in 
exciting and entertaining environments. Guess what is X?
 
Casinos - the company is Harrah's Entertainment Inc. http://
www.harrahs.com
 
Q5
Ring! Ring! Guess what? It didn't listen to its customers! Though 
customers loved flip phones, X ridiculed them and for years 
refused to make them. But what X didn't realise is that flip 
phones are cool, and that customers wanted crazy color 
screens, 
and cameras and bells and whistles. Not having them is why X's 
revenue fell in the last quarter and why its revenues were halved. 
Adding these features is what made Motorola get back into the 
groove and made Samsung hot. Name X.
 
Nokia
 
Q6
He has a khaki canvas tent outside his office. Though its initial 
purpose was to sidestep California's no-smoking laws, it quickly 
became a symbol of power and deal making. His consigliere is 
USA's second most powerful man, Warren Buffet. Who are 
we talking about?
 
Arnold Schwaeznegger, Governor of California
 
Q7
The CEO of this company says it has raised the standardof living 
of so many Americans simply by offering Every Day Low Prices. 
Economists say that it has staved off inflaiton by saving US 
customers nearly $20 billion annually. However the company 
faces charges that it does not treat its more than 1.4 million 
workers fairly. In June 2004 a federal judge awarded class-
action status to a lawsuit that accuses the company of 
systematic discrimination against as many as 1.6 million former 
and current female employees. Which company?
 
Wal-Mart.
 
Q8
For their first act this Scandinavian duo, Janus Friis and Nikolas 
Zennstrom unleashed Kazaa, the most popular file sharing 
software of all time and in the process became mortal enemies 
of the music industry. Now the duo, sequestered somewhere in 
Estonia, have launched X, software that lets users place 
telephone calls over the internet virtually free of charge and 
threatens to upend the telecommunication industry. Name the 
software X.
 
Skype
 
Q9
"It's going to be more than a museum, it's going to be an assault 
on the senses," said Enzo Francini, head of finances for the tiny 
Tuscan village of San Giovanni d'Asso, one of the main 
producers of the "white diamonds of Italy," a medieval town of 
950 people. A pharmacist, a botanist and a chef were called in to 
help create the museum in a 13th century castle. What are the 
"white diamonds of Italy"?
 
Italy's warty white truffles, once aphrodisiacs for the ancient 
Romans and now the most expensive funghi in the world. Earlier 
this week (Nov 2004), an Italian truffle weighing in at over one 
kilo (2.2 pounds) set a new international record, fetching 
$41,000 from a New York restaurateur in a heated auction. Most 
truffles are a fraction of that size. 
 
Q10
The markets opened on a firm footing with the Sensex breaching 
the 6,000-mark as Muhurat trading kicked off in BSE. There was 
wide expectation among brokers and investors that the BSE 
Sensex will touch the magic mark on the auspisious day of 
Diwali. Investors are expecting Samvat X (the new year) to be a 
better year than Y (the previous year), which saw a lot of drama 
unfolding in the markets including the black Monday. Name X.
 
Samvat 2061.

Part 8. More to Follow.

=========================
From: Vijay N S <> 
Date: Fri Nov 26, 2004 7:21pm 
Subject: GK-QuestionBank 

My interest is in finance so some related q's.

1) What is an Asset Management Company (AMC)?

The company that manages a mutual fund is called an AMC. For 
all practical purposes, it is an organized form of a "money 
portfolio manager". An AMC may have several mutual fund 
schemes with similar or varied investment objectives. The AMC 
hires a professional money manager, who buys and sells 
securities in line with the fund's stated objective.

2) What is Net Asset Value (NAV)?

NAV is the total asset value (net of expenses) per unit of the fund 
and is calculated by the Asset Management Company (AMC) at 
the end of every business day. Net asset value on a particular 
date reflects the realisable value that the investor will get for 
each unit that he his holding if the scheme is liquidated on that 
date.

3) What is a Mutual Fund?

A Mutual Fund is a vehicle for investing in stocks and bonds. It is 
not an alternative investment option to stocks and bonds, rather 
it pools the money of several investors and invests this in stocks, 
bonds, money market instruments and other types of securities. 
Buying a mutual fund is like buying a small slice of a big pizza. 
The owner of a mutual fund unit gets a proportional share of the 
fund's gains, losses, income and expenses.


4) What mutual fund is suitable for you?

Just as you would buy a computer that fits your needs and 
budget, you should choose a mutual fund that meets your risk 
tolerance and your risk capacity levels (i.e. has similar 
investment objectives as your own). Typical investment 
objectives of mutual funds include fixed income or equity, 
general equity or sector-focused, high risk or low risk, blue-chips 
or turnarounds, long-term or short-term liquidity focus. You can 
use our Find-A-Fund query module to find funds whose 
investment objectives match yours.

You can also read our expert article on Investment in Mutual 
Funds to understand how best to find a mutual fund to meet your 
needs and what
other factors to consider while evaluating mutual funds for 
investment.

5) Why does a company decide that it should do an IPO? 

As far as I am aware I don't think there is any specific limit. It is a 
function of the market. It is what the market appetite is. Of course 
you need a critical mass otherwise you wouldn't be accepted in 
the market. Typically a company, in classical management 
parlance, you have debt equity ratios and other things. But I 
believe that it is the function of the market. When the markets are 
doing well, when the equity markets are doing well, you are more 
likely to have IPOs.

6) Is learning about stocks primarily looking at the company, 
looking at the fundamentals, looking at the management? Why 
do we need technical analysis?

In technical analysis, we only look at the price, purely at the price. 
All stocks have a price. We have the open, the high, the low and 
the close. That is reflected in the software graphically. We study 
that vis-à-vis the previous year and compare to that day's or 
yesterday's price, and plot the price series over a period of time, 
and then try to forecast it. It is a study of trend, and the forecast 
is 
based on that. So we can make money by riding the trend price.

7) So there is an alternative theory to fundamental analysis out 
there called technical analysis, which depends on past trends to 
forecast future trends?

I would rather put differently. I won't say it is an alternative 
theory. 
But what I would say is that the basic premise in technical 
analyses is that price discounts everything, fundamental and 
otherwise. Whether we are aware of the fundamentals or not, we 
say price discounts everything. It is an effect of that. So it's an 
indirect way of studying fundamentals.

8) What does it mean if I say the stocks looks strong on the 
charts? 

On the charts, I feel that one must have definitely identified a 
trend. Since fundamentally, it concurs with the trend. It has given 
a confirmation on the charts. So one is riding a trend.

9) What theories are out there? What are the most popular 
theories that are followed? Why are they different from each 
other?

The basic theory in the mother of all theory, the Dow Theory. This 
has been used for over 100 years or so. Then we also have the 
Swing theory. We have Cycle theory.

10) What exactly you are looking in the Dow theory? 

Dow theory basically says that price discounts everything. Since 
everything is reflected in the price, they studied the price and 
then over a period, six rules came up. One is that whatever 
goods are produced in one sector, they have to be consumed. 
So chartists studied two separate indexes and they were seeing 
whether they were going in tandem.

11) What is the Oscillators theory? 

The basic premise in Oscillators is that momentum precedes 
the price, before the price turns the momentum turns. So 
basically we have many indicators in Oscillators. They are the 
derivatives of price. They use either the close, the open, or any of 
the parameters and make an Oscillator and we study the 
Oscillators and that gives us the signal before the price.

Subject: CAT2k4: my story and some gyan. 

Hello UrPercentile Group!

Hope you guys remember me! First, I am sorry for the vanishing 
act. heavy office work took my toll in September/October and I 
was unable to resume/send emails to any group or discusstion 
forum. Hope you  guys  found "CAT Capsules" useful.

Okay, So the C-day was over. My CAT 2004 in one word  was 
"disappointing". 
I would not put it as "Diaster". Disappointing as I could not 
perform to my
best. Well, anyway it is past and gone. Hope you guys are 
preparing well for the other exams. I have been writing  CAT  
since 2001 (CAT is addictive) and can say that the cutoff will be 
the  average of what is said by TIME and CL . :-( I will not clear in 
QA and  VA/RC. 

Regarding questions in GK, from my 2002 XAT/IIFT experince 
(though I did not get a call from XLRI/IIFT) i thought that there are 
not many books that are complete and comprehensive.  the 
Bschools often ask questions relating to Business. these types  
coudl  involve questions like "which company bought the 
following comapny to  build india's largest cellular network?". 
"Which company has the  punchline 'I will  make it to 
CAT'".."Where was the world Environment sumbit held in  
2004?"... and the likes, dont study (or remember) the capitals of 
states.. I  dont know about XAT 2003. (as i did not write that) but i 
guess most Bschools dont want to test your Georaphy but rather 
interest in  General Business and current affairs...

I found the following magzines issued by some coaching 
institues good:
1. Managment Compass by CL
2. the book given by TIME is also okay.
3. www.ptindia.com has some GK section in a PDF. it has some 
good  good GK info,

The annual issie of managment compass (oct-nov 2004) costs 
something like 150 Rs , and has good info about GK. some 600 
odd questions. You could try  getting that. It seems Urpercentile 
is coming up with some nice collection. You  could try that too . 
Their study materials were indeed good.

Thanks to all the Urpercentile members who responded positivly 
to my  CAT capsules series... I guess I still have to post the 
answers to series 5, cant  find it now on my HDD :D. And the UrP 
mods deserve some <clap><clap> for maintaining a good 
Yahoo groups and regularyly emailing the study material despite 
poor response from members. (includes me :-)) 

All the best for JMET/XAT/SNAP/MAT and other exams! 

Regards
Krishna

A big thanks to all the members who contributed to the GK q 
bank, it  was very helpful. Please guys dont stop here we will 
need as much as we can get. I think we should discuss GD PI 
topics only if anyone of us has a chance to get a call from IIM. 
Dare I speak on behalf of the  members here I think just a rare 
few have done well enough.

Hi ,
I have found this mail somewhere in my archives. Hope this will
help the junta.

GK Patterns in various exams

Note: -Please note that the details given below are based on the 
last year's GK papers. The information given below is about only 
those exams, which will have GK in its entrance tests this year. 
No details are available at present about the SNAP TEST that is 
happening for the first time and will be the route to entrance to 
SCMHRD, which earlier used to have GK in its separate 
entrance test. 

Classification of GK 

1.    Static GK : It has questions from History, Geography, Polity, 
Sports, Awards and Miscellaneous questions.
2.    Current GK : It has questions from the current affairs which 
are based on three themes i.e. Persons, Places and Events 
relating to important current news.
3.    Business GK : It has questions on Brands, Punch lines, 
CEO's, Mergers & Acquisitions and other important current & 
static business information/news..

All the GK tests have questions from these three types of GK 
only.

Institute, Number of GK Qs, Static GK, Current Affairs,  Business
Awareness    Specific Information
IRMA :    60    Yes    Yes    No    Emphasis on Socio-economic-
cultural aspects mainly
XAT :    60    Yes    Yes    Few Qs    Spanning almost every topic 
and
aspect of GK
IIFT :   50    Yes    Yes    Few Qs    Questions in this section are
from Static, Current and Business GK also.


Sources of Studying: 

1. Manorama Year Book 2004 OR Latest Manorama Year Book 
(whichever is available) ----- Specifically for Static and Current 
Affairs


2.    GK Digest by Thorpe & Thorpe---- Specifically for Static and a
little Current Affairs

3.    Management Compass--- Specifically for Business 
Awareness and Current Awareness.


Further Details & Sample Questions :

1.IRMA
In IRMA, a total of 60 questions of GK are asked. The most 
important thing to keep in mind while preparing is that many 
questions are asked related to RURAL, ECONOMIC, SOCIO and 
CULTURAL aspects of the country along with Static GK and 
Current GK based questions. To crack IRMA GK, you need to 
have a strong GK database regarding the rural India., latest 
economic data, constitution, geography and current affairs. 

Sample Questions from last year's paper

Ans:- Andhra Pradesh Farmers

60 questions are asked in this paper's GK section. This paper 
also has a very fine blend of Static and Current GK with very few 
questions on Business awareness. Questions from History, 
Geography, Polity Awards, Books and Authors, Sports and 
Miscellaneous section are asked along with questions from the 
important current events TRADITIONALLY,but last year's paper 
was quite different, it had questions based on quotations, 
management etc. ( which was completely a bolt from the blue!!) . 
You need a good level of Static as well as Current GK in order to 
crack the GK section along with some management based 
general knowledge also.

under the sun and you can expect questions from such a vast 
range also.
