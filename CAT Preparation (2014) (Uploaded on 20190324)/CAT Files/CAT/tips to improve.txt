URPERCENTILE WRITES :   Tips for DI : You must have the 
ability to identify the easy questions. The only way you will be 
able to identify easy question is by more practice. Expose 
yourself to as many questions on DI as possible. After you 
attempt questions on DI, be it right or wrong check the method 
used to solve the question by the writer of the book/reference 
material. Keep a record of all the questions you are not able to 
attempt correctly in the first go (Just write down Q No. Page No. 
and Book Name) and attempt these questions again after a few 
days. Read the legends given at the graphs properly. Have a 
look at the answers to get a feel of accuracy level required while 
solving the questions. If the options given are not very close to 
each other you may round off the the figures for calculations. 
Keep in mind some of the graphs are not drawn to scale.

For wordlist use flashcards. Flash cards may be used for 
memorising new words , formulas etc. Take a thick paper and 
make around 100 cards out of it of approximately 2.5inch*4 inch. 
Note down new words you come across on one side of a card 
and the meaning of that word on its other side. You may write 
more than one word on a card. It will be more helpful if you write 
similar words on a card. Now create such card whenever you 
come across a new word. Soon you will have a stack of cards 
which you can call, stack 1 . During your free time take out a card 
from stack 1 and see if you remember the meaning of the word 
written on the other side of the card and vice versa. If you don't 
remember the meaning of the word on the card put it back to the 
stack. If you remembered the meaning of word on a card by 
heart, you may remove the card from the stack 1 and put it on 
another stack of cards which you can call stack 2. You need to 
refer to stack 1 more often. Once in a while you need to check 
stack 2 also. If you take a card from stack 2 and find that you 
don't remember the meaning of the word on it , you need to put it 
back to stack 1.

For Sentence Rearranging  identify a solid link between any two 
given sentences and then using elimination method. Eliminate 
the given options one by one. 

TIPS FOR IMPROVING READING SKILLS : Reading skills can 
improve only over a period of time and there is no short term 
strategy for it. Read on as many subjects as you can. Try to write 
down the summary after you have read a topic. Keep a dictionary 
handy, consult it whenever required. Keep a diary of new words 
and refer it as many times as possible. Use flash card for new 
words. Note down different usage of the words. the dairy 
everyday for 15 minutes. Try to use these new words in your day 
to day work. Check different usage of the new words. Try to 
improve speed of reading at a later date , initially give more 
stress on comprehension.  Speed can be improved by reducing 
the number of eye fixation and by not speaking as you read the 
passage.

TIPS FOR SOLVING THE PASSAGES : Have a quick look at the 
questions that you have to answer before you start reading the 
passage. This will help you in knowing about the passage and 
what you are suppose to look for in it. You may even decide, if 
you want to attempt the passage or want go to the next one just 
by reading the questions and the given choices. Though it will 
take some time to master this, but it will really help. Selection of 
passage is very important. It is usually not possible to solve all 
the passages, of RC section. You can easily skip one and 
sometimes even two passages and still clear the test. 
Underline/highlight the important points in the passage as you 
read, this will later help you in answering the questions. You will 
notice that usually the first line of the paragraph gives you 
enough hint of about what is inside the paragraph. You should 
have a knowledge on wide range of subject and good vocabulary 
to manage to fare well in this section, and this will come through 
practise over a period of time.
