(a)    3

(b)   12/7

(c)    13/2

(d)   2

 answer (d)

    a little bit of trial and error, put a minum value for r+s = 1 +2 = 3

and then maximize p-q. putting values of p=9 and q =3, we will get p-q =6, anyone with a better method please let us know.

 

11. a,b,c,d are real numbers and a+b>c+d and a-b<c-d, then which of the following is definitely true?

(a)    b < d

(b)   b > d

(c)    a < c

(d)   a > c

Answer (b)

a+b>c+d

b-a>d-b

add the two equations, and we get the answer 

 

12. A and B start together from the same point on a circular course and walk in the same directions till they both again arrive at the starting point. If A completes a circle in 224 seconds and B in 364 seconds, how many times does A meet B including the last meeting?

(a)    10

(b)   8

(c)    6

(d)   5

 Answer: (d).  LCM of 224, 364 is 4*7*8*13.

So A runs 4*7*8*13/224 =13 times

B runs 4*7*8*13/364 = 8 times

So the number of times A will pass B is 13-8 = 5. (this includes the last meeting).

 

13. What is the least value of (x-1)(x-3)(x-4)(x-6) + 10 for real values of x?

(a)    1

(b)   10

(c)    9

(d)   0

Answer: (a)

  (x-1)(x-3)(x-4)(x-6) + 10 = (x-1)(x-6)(x-3)(x-4) + 10

= (x2 - 7x + 6) (x2 -7x + 12) +10

let x2 - 7x + 6 = y

the _expression reduces to y2 + 6y +10 = (y +3)2 + 1

the mimum value for the expresion hence is 1.

Directions 5-7: Each question below has a set of four sentences A, B, C and D with one blank each. There are four words following these sentences. Each of the four words can fit into one or more of the four sentences. Find the maximum number of times any word can fit into the blanks given in each set of the sentences and mark that as your answer.

Please note: Here we have to mark the maximum number of times the word can fit into the picture and not the choice of the word. But I am very sorry! I made a mistake when typing in the questions :-). This is taken from a TIME MOCK CAT, and all choices in the question paper were marked/indicated as (1) (2) (3) (4) and not as (a) (b) (c) (d). So kindly read all choices index to be numbers. From next question paper I shall have the index to be numbers (just as in TIME papers)
