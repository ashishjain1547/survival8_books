1)When a four digit number is multiplied by N,the four digit 
number repeats itself to give an 8 digit number .If four digit 
number has all distinct digits then N is a multiple of ?
a)11 b) 37 c)73 d) 27

the number is of the form abcdabcd i.e 10001* abcd

1001 is not divisible by 27 and 11 so tried 73 and thats the answer.


5)The number from 1 to 33 are written side by side as follows : 
123456...........33.If this number is divided by 9 what is the 
remainder?
a)0 b)1 c)3 d) 6

1 to 33 comprises in units place 0 to 9 3 times i.e 45 * 3 = 135.  
Similarly 1 and 2 10 times in tens place ... i.e 30 and then for 30 to 33 
... 12 + 6 = 18

So total sum is 135 + 30 + 18 = 183 i.e remainder of 3 Ans.

 


6)  A positive three digit number X is such,when divided in two 
unequal three digit number,the larger part is the aritmetic mean 
of X and the smaller part.How many values can X take?
a)300 b)234 c)198 d)None

Let X be the number and K be the larger number then K=(X+X-K)/2 i.e K = 
2X/3 and X-K = X/3

Now X/3 should be a 3 digit number i.e true from X = 300 to X= 999 i.e 
every 3rd number here will satisfy the condition.. hence number od 
numbers are (699 - 300) /3  + 1 = 234


7)A 101 digit number 222.........2X3...333  is formed by repeating 
the digit 2,50 times followed by the digit X and then repeating the 
digit 3,50 times.The number is a multiple of 7.Find the value of 
X.?
a)2 b)3 c ) 4 d ) 5

I guess 5 as 22533 is divisible :)


8) There are ten coin making machine.Nine of them produces 
coins of 10 gm each while the tenth machine produces coins 
with 11 gm weight . If one has a weight measuring instrument to 
measure weight in grams,how many minimum number of 
readings are required to determine which machine produces 
heavier coins?
a)1 b)3 c)4 d)None of these

3 weighings... Group them into 4 groups 3 (A , B , C) of 3 coins each 
and the last one (D) with a single coin. Weigh A with B If A is heavy , 
Group A in 3 groups of a single coin each  and wigh 2 of them... 
similary with B.

In case A=B then the the faulty coin is either from group C or D... 
this again requires 2 weighings.. So minimun of 3 weighings are required.



10) The number 444444....(999 times) is definitely divisible by:
a)22 b)44 c)222 d)444

I think it should be divisible both by 222 and 444

Basically We can write 4444...(999 times) as 

444*(1001001... (with 333 1s)) which is divisible by 444 and 222


11)If a three digit number is divided into three two digit numbers 
and if all these three two digit numbers from an A.P. with a 
common difference of 20.How many three digit numbers satisfy 
this condition?
a)54 b)45 c)46 d) 55

Lets the numbers be X-20 , X , X + 20. Then a = 3X , X= a/3 .. where a 
is 3 digit and X + 20 is two digit number. Lets imagine X+20 be 99 
(this can be max 2 digit number) then X = 79 and a = 3 * 79 = 237 is 3 
digit. To find the lower limit ...33 * 3 = 99 (a two digit number) hence X 
= 33 + 1 = 34... i.e a = 112.

So we need numbers from 112 to 237 differing with common diff 3 ... So 
no. of numbers = (237-112)/3 + 1 = 46




12) If first 23 terms of the series 1,11,111 are added together 
,what digit would occupy the thousands place?
a)3 b)0 c)9 d)2


Adding units 1 give 23 i.e 3 at units place with 2 carry over ... Tens 
sum = 22 + 2 = 24 ... i.e 4 at tens place and 2 carry over. Similarly 
thousans place has 20  1s i.e 20 + 2 as the carry over. So 2 is the 
answer


13)A chord is drawn arbitrarily in a given circle.What is the 
probability that the length of the chord is less than or equal to the 
radius of the circle?
a)0.5 b)0.25 c)0 d)0.33

Guess 0.25


15)How many natural numbers are factors of 7560 and multiples 
of 14?
a)20 b)22 c)24 d)28

7560/14 = 540 = 3^3 * 2^2 * 5^1

Number of factors of 540 = (3+1)(2+1)(1+1) = 24 Ans.


16)Definition:If a,k and n are positive integers with k>1,and n=k*a 
,then a is called proper divisor of n.How many positive integers 
less than 54 are equal to the product of their proper divisors?
a)1 b)8 c)10 d)14

I felt all the non primes including 1 less than 54 should be answer... 
thats counts to 37.


17) Given that A is a six digit number with unit digit of 1,and B is a 
natural number which is the fourth root of A,what is the largest 
possible value of B?
a)23 b)29 c)31 d)37

30^4 = 810000 .. so the number is more than 30.. also 35^4 = 1500625   
so the number is less than 35..

Hence 31


18)How many integers greater  than 40,00,000 and less than 
90,00,000 are perfect squares?
a)100 b)999 c)1000 d)1999

All the numbers more than 2000 and less than 3000 will have their 
squares in this range.

i.e (3000-2000)-1 = 999 numbers

19)Six integers are selected from 1 to 100 in such a way that the 
smallest positive difference between any two of them is as large 
as possible.What is this difference?
a)16 b)17 c)19 d)20

basically we need to have 5 divisions in between  1..to ..100 i.e 100/2 
= 20

But if we choose 1st number as 1 then the numbers are 
1,21,41,61,81,101... Since 101 cant be in.. the max difference is 19

20)How many different points in the xy plane are at a distance of 
5 from the origin and have coordinates (a,b) ,where a and b are 
integers?
a)4 b)6 c)8 d) 12

x^2 + y^2 = 25.... only possible with (0,5) and (3,4) ,(4,3)  but each 
of these can have 4 sets as

(0,5) => (0,5),(0,-5) , (5,0) , (-5,0)

(3,4) => (3,4) , (3,-4) , (-3,4) , (-3,-4)

(4,3)... similarily 4 values

So total 12 values.
