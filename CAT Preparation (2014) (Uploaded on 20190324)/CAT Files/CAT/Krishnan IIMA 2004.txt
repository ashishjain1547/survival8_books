1. How is life at IIM-A like?

During first year, academic pressures are pretty high.  but you
can chill during the second year.  we see our seniors have a lot
of time to pursue various interests. 
We have a number of clubs catering to varied interests.  also
ramp parties every alternate saturday thats about it.

2. What should be the strategy of preparation for CAT at this time
when only around 80 days are left ?
complete the basic reference material, keep abreast of the
current affairs, read as much on any topic, never give up on your
aim regardless of what results you get in your mock tests.

3. How to attack the Mock tests (strategies to be adopted while
attempting the papers) ?
Allocate fixed time to all sections, it is better to be above average
in all three sections, than excellent in one and below average in
the other two, so plan your time allocation accordingly.

4. How to select the proper questions to attempt ?
It is more important that you should have atleast read all the
questions in the paper, that way you will not miss any of the easy
ones.

5. How to gain maximum out of the mock tests ?

6. My performance at Mock was :
it was never more than 97.8,

7. Tips for tackling CAT, GD/PI :
loooong time for that, just concentrate on clearing CAT, parallelly
keep reading the current affairs mags, and also economic times.


Best of Luck to all UrPercentile Members.

1. How is life at IIM-A like? very hectic and stressful. IIMA is not a
picnic party.I can handle stress (I was in mktg for nearly 5 yrs)but
have seen many breaking down.

2. What should be the strategy of preparation for CAT at this time
when only around 80 days are left ?
Since i was working, i never had enough time to join any
coaching or study at one go. I prepared for a week and managed
to crack CAT (4 calls and 3 conversions)

3. How to attack the Mock tests (strategies to be adopted while
attempting the papers) ?
Cant say, did not write any.. But it should be a good idea. May
give u some sort of idea.

4. How to select the proper questions to attempt ? Dont waste
too much time on tuf Qs. There will be lot of sitters in the middle
part. Also if u r strong in RC and DA but weak in QA dont try to
answer all in RC and DA and put in more time for QA and vice
versa (I was weak in QM)

5. How to gain maximum out of the mock tests ? No idea

6. My performance at Mock was : NA

7. Tips for tackling CAT, GD/PI :
CAT, GD, PI = be cool. Be normal. I know guys with good CAT
scores who screwed up their chances in GD by making the
place a fishmarket or too aggressive. Also dont be too meek. If u
open up ur mouth, talk only sense. No farting around. The panel
members are gods. In PI I was frank, forthright and honest. I tried
to put pressure on me. NEver beat around the bush. Met all Qs
with a smiling countenance.

Warning: IIMA is a tough place. Far tougher than B and C
(feedback from my pals out there). No wonder it is the best. But if
u make it to IIMA, remember life is not going to be easy.

Best of Luck to all UrPercentile Members.

Hope this helps...

1. How is life at IIM-A  like?
Apart from the academics, life at IIM-A is a big big learning.. the
most important being u learn how to balance ur life when u r
being stretched from different corners.. initially u may get totally
lost, but, take my word, once u get used to it, u wud love it!!!
Better be prepared for the big thing!

2. What should be the strategy of preparation for CAT at this time
when only around 80 days are left ?
Take lots and lots of tests.. section tests may also prove helpful..
but in the later half, go for only full length tests.. analyse ur
performance for each and every test u take.. a thorough
analysis.. if u get time apart from ur allocated prep time, do read
books and magazines...

3. How to attack the Mock tests (strategies to be adopted while
attempting the papers) ?
U have time to experiment with different strategies.. but have a
clear defined strategy before any mock tests.. and STRICTLY
follow the strategy.. may be a very little deviation.. have a
comprehensive plan abt time management, section order, what
to attempt and what to leave and of course contingency plans
etc..


4. How to select the proper questions to attempt ?
Here giving a number of tests wud help.. u will develop a fair
idea of different kind of questions that may come in CAT paper...
and also what kind of question u crack in no time and what takes
u time.. sit and think abt it and test ur findings in a mock CAT...
this is what Mock CATs are for.. isn't it?

5. How to gain maximum out of the mock tests ?
Pre-mock : have a clear, defined, comprehensive strategy.. brush
up the basics the day before the test

during mock: strictly follow ur gameplan.. may change a little if
the pattern is not as per ur expectation..

post-mock: analyse the paper thoroughly.. I used to give 3-4 hrs
for it. classify the qs in attempted & wrong, attempted & correct,
tried to attempted but left and not attempted.. and then analyse
accordingly.. mind u analyse ur performance for the qs u gave
correct answer. u may get some useful insight

6. My performance at Mock was : somewhere in the top 100

7. Tips  for  tackling CAT, GD/PI :
CAT: as they say chill out the day before the DAY.. get a sound
sleep.. very important.. u need to have 100% focus on the DAY..
be prepared for noise arnd ur centre.. be calm of u find the paper
tough.. it will be tough for everyone.. follow ur gameplan..

GD/PI: do not worry abt it!! focus on CAT. if u have time apart frm
ur CAT prep, u can study some magazines on certain HOT
issues

Best of Luck to all UrPercentile  Members.

Subject: Hi all aspirants

Hi guys,
lemme give a short intro. My name is Rangarajan. I am a
Chartered Accountant and made it to IIMA this year...
got a few mails to the yahoo groups account asking for some
advice .
So here goes:

1. one way to crack cat is practice.
2. The next way is more practice.
3. The last way out is even more practice.

Believe me, the more 2-hour tests you take under simulated
conditions, the more of a routine it will become. analyse your
performances in each of the mock tests. it is good to have some
national level standings to help you know where u stand.

Now is a decent enuf time to start. Make sure that you do arnd 40
tests (2 hrs each) bfr u go in for the actual exams.

That way, taking the exams will become so much of a routine
that you will not feel afraid of it any more.

Cheers!
Hope to see some of u as our facchas next year

Rangarajan
