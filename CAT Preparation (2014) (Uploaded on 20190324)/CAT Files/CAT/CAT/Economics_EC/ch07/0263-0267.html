Consumers' Search for Information

</H2>

<P>Any discussion of the economic implications of the means by which
sellers provide information to consumers needs to consider the means by
which consumers search for product information in a digital world. In
physical markets, consumer search activities include reading advertisements,
calling vendors, and visiting stores. In a virtual marketplace, all these activities
converge into web searches and web browsing. Not surprisingly,
search services were the first market infrastructure to be built in the electronic
marketplace. The focus of this chapter is to investigate the nature of existing search
mechanisms as information channels. It also evaluates the effectiveness of
search services and information intermediaries in terms of the economic
efficiency that the digital information market may achieve through the proliferation
of these search channels.

7.1.Consumer Searches and Economic Efficiency
</A></H3>

<P>A market is considered to be economically efficient when a product is sold
at the lowest possible price or at the marginal cost of production for a given
level of quality. For a standard product that can be produced by many firms using
a
</P>


<A NAME="PAGENUM-264"><P>Page 264</P></A>


<P>common technology, an efficient price is unique. In real markets, however,
a uniform price is seldom observed because sellers and buyers have
different information about the price and quality of a product. Bargain hunters
must visit many stores to gather information on different prices and product
specifications, and compare their records before deciding which offers the best
deal. This search process clearly has costs associated with it. To obtain full
information about prices and product qualities, consumers must incur
unnecessarily high search expenses and duplicate the efforts of other consumers. An
efficient solution strikes a balance between the benefits of an efficient marginal
price and the costs required to inform all market participants about price and
product quality.
</P>

<P>In general, firms know more about their products than do the
consumers. This informational advantage gives firms some degree of market power,
which is usually manifested in the form of a product price greater than the
competitive price. If consumers were to receive advertising about price and
product quality from all sellers in the market, their purchase decision would be
based on who offered the lowest price or the best price for the desired quality.
However, consumers do not tend to receive all the relevant market
information, because some sellers may not advertise or some advertisements may not
reach all the intended audience. This lack of consumer knowledge creates
inefficiencies in the form of sellers charging higher prices than the marginal costs
of production, or the existence of multiple prices that discriminate against
some consumers. In an extreme case, quality uncertainty may result in the
complete failure of a market, as in the lemons market problem discussed in Chapter
4. For all these reasons, an efficient market for product information is
necessary for the existence of an efficient product market.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch07_ 3">
Search Costs
</A></H4>

<P>The cost of a search is any amount of money, time, or effort that buyers
may incur in obtaining price and quality information for products. Examples
of costly information gathering are visits to stores (which involve
transportation and time costs), telephone calls, buying newspapers, and so on. In
physical markets, searches usually happen sequentially&#151;that is, consumers visit
one store, gather information, decide whether or not to purchase, and visit the
next store if the product is not bought (see fig. 7.1).
</P>

<P>Suppose that Alice goes to the store #1, and finds the offer price is
$10. Suppose also that it costs $1 to visit each store, and that, for simplicity,
this cost is the same for all visits. Including the search cost, she faces the total
price of $11 at the first store she visits. She must decide whether to accept or
reject the offer. Her purchasing process may be either &quot;take-it-or-leave-it&quot;
(accepting the posted price), or &quot;bargaining.&quot; If she goes to a second store, she
incurs another $1 for her search. If the second store offers the same product at
$9.50, Alice would have been better off buying it at the first store, because the
total price at the second store is $11.50 ($9.50 + $1 + $1). Suppose that $9.50
is the competitive price and every consumer knows that fact. However,
despite consumers' knowledge, prices higher than the competitive price are still
observed in the market because of the search cost. If all sellers follow this
reasoning, there can only be one stable equilibrium price, which is at the
monopoly price. Even when the search cost is reduced to an arbitrarily small amount,
the logic of this result remains valid unless the search cost actually becomes
zero. In summary, this scenario demonstrates that prices will be
monopolistic&#151;or arbitrarily high&#151;even when there are many competing sellers, as long
as consumers are not informed and must incur search costs.

<P>Figure 7.1Sequential and simultaneous searches.
</P>

<P>The search cost scenario changes significantly in the case of
repeat purchases. When consumers buy the same products repeatedly over a long
period of time, they become familiar with the prices charged by each seller in
the market. Except for the case in which everyone shops at the same store,
some sellers may actually lower prices to attract more customers. In a sense,
buyers accumulate price information and make their purchasing decisions based
on this simultaneously (refer to fig. 7.1). For those who have pricing
information, prices become efficient, approaching the competitive level if stores
compete fiercely in price. Consumers who prefer to shop at the same store are
not informed, and some stores continue to charge higher prices than the
competitive price, depending upon uninformed consumers. Repeat purchasers
are somewhat like &quot;natives,&quot; who have information about prices charged by
local merchants, while those without information are &quot;tourists.&quot; In this version
of the native-and-tourist model, a range of prices can be observed that
discriminate against uninformed consumers.

<H4><A NAME="ch07_ 4">
Consumer Searches and Electronic Commerce
</A></H4>

<P>Similar to searches in physical markets, online searches can also be carried
out either sequentially or simultaneously. Surfing through different web stores is
a sequential search; a price search based on a price database is an example of
a simultaneous search. In either case, an online search offers a tremendous
advantage over a physical search. Besides the lowered costs for time and
transportation, a computer-based search allows consumers to remember and
compare information gathered from many stores. Furthermore, online searches
enable consumers to process a wide range of information other than price, such
as location and name of vendors, terms of sales, quality and performance
variables, brand names, sizes and other product characteristics, and so
forth. Comparing prices alone strains the capacity to process information in
physical markets, especially if shopping involves many products. Online search
technologies automate this process and allow consumers to engage in more
sophisticated and efficient searches.
</P>

<P>The search and information transmission mechanisms used in the
electronic marketplace are too new for researchers to have determined their
efficiency. In fact, there are contradicting predictions about what will
happen. One view is that with computer technologies such as search engines
and intelligent software agents, consumers may be able to search the whole
information space at no cost. For example, suppose you want to buy a
product. Using a computer program, you initiate a search mechanism that searches
all the web pages on the Internet for a product that matches your needs.
The search generates a table of names of sellers, prices, locations, and
product specifications, as well as other relevant information such as seller
reputation, past sales records, and so forth. You then choose a seller among the
candidates, and initiate a purchase order. Although this scenario is close to one with
no search costs, which produces an efficient market, there are many reasons
why the electronic marketplace may not actually be so efficient. In the first
place, sellers may not provide relevant information. Secondly, search algorithms
or techniques may not be sufficient to gather all the relevant information.
This may be because of access difficulties (because some web sites do not
allow access), or because all searches inevitably select and process information
based
