<P>Wide Web, with the largest and the fastest-growing servers today.
Nevertheless, the web is only one of a large number of digital information resources.
Despite the growing trend to move files from non-web servers to web servers,
some files may be better served through traditional information channels such
as anonymous FTP. One example is the downloading of free software, which
is far easier and is customizable with an anonymous FTP program than with
the World Wide Web. In addition, one of the advantages of the World Wide
Web is its capability to handle different data servers, including FTP, Gopher,
electronic mail, and others. Precisely for this reason, FTP and Gopher files
need not be moved into the web (HTTP) server, which will prolong the life
of many non-web information servers.
</P>

<P>Numerous introductory books have been written with step-by-step
user instructions that inventory all types of resources and services available on
the Internet (see, for example Hahn, 1996). The following review of
Internet services is not meant to provide an exhaustive description, but rather to
highlight the characteristics of the information provided and each service's
efficiency in facilitating information searches. For the purposes of this
discussion, the wide range of Internet information sources can be divided into three
broad groups:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>          Services based on file transfers: World Wide Web, Gopher, FTP
and Telnet
<LI>          Services used for broadcasting and exchanging information:
UseNet, mailing lists, and electronic messaging
<LI>          Services that involve real-time interactions: talk, Internet Relay
Chat, and Multiple User Dungeons (MUDs)
</UL>

<P>Although these services are not an altogether practical way of storing
and searching information for real-time services, they are discussed here.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch07_ 14">
The World Wide Web
</A></H4>

<P>The World Wide Web is a system of servers interconnected throughout
the world that is capable of providing all types of data including text,
graphics, videos, and audio, through viewing programs called
browsers. Anyone using a
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-284"><P>Page 284</P></A>


<P>web browser becomes a client and can connect to any web server that
provides content. The two overwhelming advantages of the web over other
information channels are (1) its multimedia capability, and (2) its capability to
interface with web servers as well as to e-mail, gopher, UseNet, and so on. These
advantages are so overpowering that the web is well on its way to superceding
all other information access methods in the future. Other advantages of the
web include the capability to jump from place to place via hypertext links, and
an easy and familiar graphical user interface, although these features are
not necessarily the ones that are driving the popularity of the web in the long
run. In fact, navigating through too many jumps and links can often result in
an unmanageable work session.
</P>

<P>As the web becomes the dominant means of accessing information on
the Internet, information based on non-web technologies is moving to web
servers. Previously, one needed to search different types of information space.
In the end, all information searches will be done within the web environment
as FTP and Gopher files are also cataloged and accessible through web
servers. Although it is fast becoming a necessary evil, transforming contents
into HTML files for the web is more time-consuming than for FTP or
Gopher servers, which essentially use text files without the additional command
insertions that are required for HTML files. Although programs are available
that facilitate file conversions to HTML, shifting a large number of files from
non-web servers to web servers is still a laborious process. Concurrently, as the
web space explodes, managing indexes and devising more efficient search
methods is becoming increasingly complicated, because web documents are
more diverse than those residing in non-web servers.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch07_ 15">
Web Searches
</A></H4>

<P>The challenge for web search servers and consumers is how to filter,
organize, and process search information, which is essentially information
(indexes) about information (web contents). The following sections first focus on
non-web information sources and provide a brief description of the search
methods
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-285"><P>Page 285</P></A>


<P>of each. Section 7.5 focuses on the informational efficiency of web
search services in more detail.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch07_ 16">
Gopher
</A></H4>

<P>The gopher system is quite similar to the web in most of its methods of
accessing and distributing information. Since its development in April, 1991 at
the University of Minnesota, it has seen phenomenal growth in the number
of servers and files offered, but then a precipitous decline due to the popularity of the web. Gopher is essentially a system of Gopher servers containing files that can be connected and accessed by others using Gopher client programs. In its architecture, the Gopher is not much different from the web.
However, Gopher was developed as a cheap and easy way to share information
resources in a wide area network called
Gopherspace. It presents a simple text-based menu of  files and directories of other gopher servers. It can also handle
non-text formats such as graphic and sound files. To view these, Gopher uses
helper applications, just as web browsers do, to process images and sounds. In
this respect, however, the web server is more versatile and can process
multimedia files seamlessly. Also, the graphic-rich user interface of the web and the
ability of web users to publish and present their content online have made the
web the overwhelming choice for Internet information interchange.
</P>

<P>Despite the decline of the Gopher system, however, it remains an
easy-to-use, fast source of text-based information. An immense amount of
information, saved as simple text files, is available under gopher servers. Public,
governmental, and educational institutions in particular maintain a large
database of information on their Gopher servers. Many of these files await
conversion to web resources, but many will remain as Gopher files that can be accessed
by web browsers.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch07_ 17">
Gopher Search
</A></H4>

<P>Gopherspace increased, and in 1992 a method of keeping track of all
menus and files on local Gopher servers was developed. The system, called
Veronica,
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-286"><P>Page 286</P></A>


<P>periodically sends requests to all gopher servers for a copy of all menus,
which itself becomes a searchable database. A Veronica query consists of keywords
a user specifies; results are presented in a menu of found items. Veronica
servers are set up by major organizations around the world as a public service.
Because of their comprehensiveness and limited number, Veronica servers are
often busy, but the search databases cover the Gopherspace more completely
than web search indexes currently can for web pages.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch07_ 18">
Anonymous FTP and Telnet
</A></H4>

<P>The web and Gopher are both, in essence, automated file transfer
programs. Computer networks were first built to exchange files among different
computers using a set File Transfer Protocol (FTP) to ensure interoperability.
The development of various Internet services has been the result of
technological progress in making this file transfer process easier and broadening it to
enable all types of files to be transferred and viewed. The web is merely the latest
stage of this development.
</P>

<P>FTP, on the other hand, was the first interactive service between
computers that required users to have a user ID and password to log in. Even in this
age of web browsing, file transfers between two machines or computer
accounts are accomplished via FTP. Anonymous FTP refers to an FTP server that
is configured to accept anonymous logins so that even users who do not have
an account with the host computer can log in, view, and download files,
although uploading is often limited to authorized persons.
</P>

<P>The importance of anonymous FTP service lies in the immense
mountain of information that resides on these servers. Archives of most
information channels are stored in anonymous FTP servers, but most importantly
Internet software, both freeware and shareware, is distributed via anonymous FTP.
</P>

<P>Telnet is similar in appearance to an FTP program in that users establish
a connection to a host computer and log in using their user ID and
password. However, Telnet allows users far wider control over the session. Users
can
