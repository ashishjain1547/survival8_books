<P>When unrelated product markets are artificially linked,
optimization cannot be expected to prevail. The objectives in the television
programming market will only occasionally match the objectives of the advertising
market. In the advertising-supported TV market, the type and quality of programs
are determined not by consumer preferences but by the incentive to
maximize profits from advertising. As a result, TV executives choose programs with
little consideration for consumer demand. Similar inefficiencies will be observed
in advertiser-supported search services.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch11_ 9">
Search Engines and Advertising
</A></H4>

<P>Search engine providers that use advertising are intermediaries, just like
TV networks, that sell access to consumers or consumer information to
advertisers. Their search databases are like television programs that attract an
audience. However, why would a narrow-cast medium like the Internet need a
business model that evolved to address the peculiar problem of selling
over-the-air entertainment? Unlike in mass media markets, Internet markets for
content and advertisements can be separated. In the advertisement market,
sellers (advertisers) can sell their products directly to consumers. Consumers will
be paid for reading advertisements. In the search market, consumers will
pay service providers directly for the information. In either market, product
selection and prices will be based on preferences and costs relevant to either
advertisements or search information.
</P>

<P>Some consumers prefer not to pay for search services and are willing
to tolerate advertising banners that are presented with search results. Others
are frustrated by the delay caused by graphic banners, which often
maintain surreptitious connections with advertising servers. Even as bandwidth
becomes cheaper, congestion will remain due to the ever-increasing size of content.
In addition to the congestion problem, essential problems remain
regarding advertiser-supported search services.
</P>

<P>First, as in broadcasting, advertisers cannot be sure of the effectiveness
of advertising. Second, while an advertiser-based free service (like TV) or a
flat-fee billing system (like newspapers) may seem to be a cost-effective and
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-472"><P>Page 472</P></A>


<P>
equitable way of providing services, this is not the case. Some consumers
are discouraged from using the service because of the distortion introduced
by advertising. Others use the service beyond an efficient level, resulting in
the abuse or waste of the resource because it is free or cheap to use.</P>

<P>The commercialization of search services best exemplifies how
broadcast-based business models are commonly applied to electronic commerce
without serious consideration of the implications. This section's discussion is
not intended to press for a usage-based fee structure for search services, nor
to advocate publicly supporting search services. The discussion does,
however, demonstrate that the Internet's technological differences warrant a
reexamination of business models based on mass communications media.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch11_ 10">
Digital Cataloging Guidelines
</A></H4>

<P>The efficiency of Internet searches will ultimately depend on web pages
providing consistent product descriptions of themselves. An increasing array
of products are digitized and sold in electronic commerce, beyond digital
versions of paper-based products. Product descriptions in these cases should be
more than mere descriptions of physical appearance because digital products
essentially consist of ones and zeros. Nevertheless, little effort is being exerted to
set standards and guidelines for digital cataloging. Two aspects of digital
cataloging are relevant for electronic commerce: content description and
search interfacing.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch11_ 11">
Content Description
</A></H4>

<P>Catalogs list and describe items available for sale or for other purposes, such
as in the case of library catalogs. A good catalog not only describes a
product succinctly but also provides a useful classification. Once such catalogs exist
for all web resources, the efficiency of Internet searches will be greatly enhanced.
</P>

<P>No guidelines or agreed-upon standards exist for digital catalogs.
Digital libraries are developing digital catalog standards but these are based on
conventional methods (that is, digital library catalogs are based on non-digital
library catalogs with a simple addition about file types). The catalog industry has
been
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-473"><P>Page 473</P></A>


<P>
working on electronic catalog standards in connection with
CommerceNet since 1994 <a href="(http://www.commerce.net/work/taskforces/catalogs).">
(http://www.commerce.net/work/taskforces/catalogs).</A>
Electronic catalogs refer to electronic versions of product catalogs that producers
and retailers offer consumers for ordering. Although one goals of its task force is
to develop a framework to define products using taxonomies, the task force
has focused narrowly on the question of search interfaces and architecture.</P>

<P>Because of the sheer number of web resources, it is easier for
content producers to provide content descriptions when products are made than to
rely on Internet search agents visiting web pages after they are made. When
geographic data is collected, it is conventional to compile meta-data describing
the data; for all physical databases, producers compile codebooks without
which they are often useless. The same logic should apply to web resources and
all digital products.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch11_ 12">
Search Interfaces
</A></H4>

<P>Once adequate product descriptions exist for all digital products, they must 
be presented on demand to searchers, who may use a variety of search methods 
or desire to access multiple catalogs for comparison. The CommerceNet
Cat-alog Working Group is developing such an open and versatile electronic
catalog system. Although the group is developing the framework for the catalog
industry, such as virtual mail-order firms, it can be used for electronic commerce
in general.
</P>

<P>One of the group's proposed systems utilizes smart catalogs and
virtual catalogs (Keller, 1997). Smart catalogs are product descriptions provided
by producers. Virtual catalogs are maintained by intermediaries (retailers)
and provide interfaces between consumers who seek information and
producers who offer (smart) catalogs. Under the virtual catalog system, consumers
need not interact with each producer to perform multi-vendor comparisons.
Virtual catalogs allow producers control over their own catalogs, and offer
dynamic and up-to-date catalog information. Precisely such a system is needed
for Internet searches because of the large number of content vendors, the speed
at which content changes, and the efficiency of intermediaries in
maintaining quality and measuring and billing for usage.

11.3. Copyright Protection Standards
</A></H3>

<P>As mentioned in Chapter 5, electronic commerce requires not only a
reexamination of basic business models and assumptions, as seen earlier, but
also requires basic revisions of policy. Efforts are being made to amend or
reinvent copyright laws to suit digital products and electronic commerce. The
practicality and viability of any scheme will ultimately be determined by
product characteristics, consumer usage behavior, and economic efficiency.
Copyright enforcement efforts are needed when an author's market is eroded by
unauthorized copies. But in some cases, the author's rights can be better protected
by market-oriented mechanisms than by legal measures.
</P>

<P>In general, current copyright debate revolves around the revision of
existing laws to adapt to the new technological environment. However, the
characteristics and usage pattern of digital products may be sufficiently different
from paper-based products to require a fundamental shift in protecting the
market for new, digital products. For example, the reproductive right features
prominently in copyright law because reproduction via variant technologies of
the printing press has been the primary mode of production, distribution,
and usage in the paper-based world. In the digital world, however,
reproduction often occurs for technical reasons, without the intention to duplicate
and distribute. Sometimes, using a digital file may not even involve
reading the document. For example, a user may want to obtain a graph summarizing
a database; the database itself is never physically read or viewed except by
the graphing program. Such differences must be considered as laying the
foundation for the digital age begins with a fundamental shift in copyright
protection. If current copyright law is a product of the invention of printing presses,
the new digital copyright law should account for the changes that digital
technologies bring into the paper-based world.
</P>

<P>Important issues remain to be addressed. Missing in the current
copyright debate is how the determination of copyright affects the pricing of
digital products and government policies. A copyright payment is the royalty paid
to the author to compensate for the cost of the production. Because
