<P>
payment is made for each reproduction of the original, the copyright
payment is the cost of reproduction. For this reason, variable costs for digital
products will not be zero even when the costs of duplicating a digital file may
come close to zero. As a result, the marginal cost of a digital product will vary
with copyright payment, and the efficient price of a digital product will largely be 
a function of royalty payments, which account for a substantial portion
of manufacturing costs. To see how the definition of copyright affects
government policy, consider that, if a sale is made for a digital product, the
income from the sale may be treated as an ordinary sale or as a royalty payment from
a reproduction. The same income, then, will be governed by different
federal income tax laws regarding sales income or royalty income, which are taxed
at different rates.</P>

<P>The real impact of copyright modifications will be judged in the
marketplace. Content owners' primary concern is the loss of revenue due to
unauthorized reproductions and sales. Where revenue opportunities do not
exist, copyright enforcement is only symbolic. Similarly, if there is no incentive
to reproduce and distribute without authorization, the cost and effort
expended to secure copyrights would not be economically justified. Products can
be designed with this in mind. Many digital products can be personalized so as
to make them useless for any other person. Highly time-sensitive
information soon turns worthless, other than for archiving purposes. And finally,
some products can be delivered interactively and in a secure manner, similar to
stock market data distributed via private networks. Making products insensitive
to reproduction and resale is an alternative to the vexing problem of
securing digital copyright.

11.4. The Use of Consumer Information
</A></H3>

<P>Because there are sizable gains to be made from refining
consumer demand information, collecting information about consumer preferences is
widely promoted, and electronic commerce provides a unique opportunity for
this.
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-476"><P>Page 476</P></A>


<P>
But, although this information is clearly helpful to the sellers and researchers,
a standard must be established to protect consumers. Presently,
information collectors need only give notification and disclosure to consumers before
using such consumer information.</P>

<P>Rather than relying on regulatory solutions, however, innovative
concepts are being tested in electronic commerce. One new idea is to give
consumers the right to sell information about themselves. As discussed in section 8.3,
this market-based solution turns personal information into a marketable
commodity. Many online services are offered in return for divulging personal
information. In this case, the price for that information will be equal to the value
of the service offered. Some consumers may use the service heavily, implying
a high price for their information. Others may give out their information for
a service they seldom use, signaling a low value for their personal
information. Going beyond reporting names and addresses, consumers may be willing
to sell all types of consumption data if the price is right. In a way, consumers
will become information sellers by participating in market research or focus groups.
</P>

<P>At least in one sense, selling personal consumption data may be
detrimental to consumer welfare. In electronic commerce, such data will be
directly linked to purchasing and price negotiation. With demand known, sellers
may refuse to lower prices below a level that they think is a consumer's
valuation. However, rather than going back to a market with imperfect demand
and inferior product quality, the market may be able to produce an equitable
and efficient result. For example, the potentially higher sale price can be
partly compensated by a higher payment for personal information. This also
demonstrates a reason consumer information may have to be priced and traded in
the market. A slew of economic questions arise regarding prices and the
efficiency in such a market. Perhaps the vigor evidenced in the debate on privacy
and anonymity among legal scholars, government officials, and free-speech
activists might guide economists to this task in the future.

<H3><A NAME="ch11_ 15">
11.5. Digital Products and Pricing
</A></H3>

<P>In this nascent field of research in electronic commerce, economists
already have developed multiple&#151;often contradictory&#151;theories of how digital
products should be distributed, sold and priced. Some argue for bundling (a sort
of flat fee) while others argue for micropayments (a sort of usage-based
pricing). Each has some evidence for justification and mathematical as well as
economic proofs (see Chapter 8 for more information on pricing and bundling).
However, this section cautions against applying existing models of physical
markets to the electronic marketplace. Those who see electronic commerce as simply
an alternative marketing channel find spurious similarities between digital
products and their physical counterparts, and argue that electronic
commerce pricing will be no different from physical markets where vendors prefer
bundling and subscription. Although some products and services will indeed
be better served by bundling and subscription, this practice will be only a
small part of how digital products will be sold in electronic commerce. Instead,
the changing nature of information goods and market processes will demand
more flexible distribution and pricing schemes, such as microproducts
and micropayments.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch11_ 16">
Bundling and Subscription
</A></H4>

<P>In the physical world, information products are often bundled and sold on
by subscription, and that observation has convinced many that the same
practice may be adequately applied to pricing digital products. Witness the way
a newspaper is delivered: all sorts of news and information in a
one-size-fits-all package. Cable services, on the other hand, are priced as a tier instead of as a
la carte options. Bundles of this type are convenient because precise
information about consumer demand for each component or between components is
not</P>


<A NAME="PAGENUM-478"><P>Page 478</P></A>


<P>
required; consumers can also average out the fluctuation in product
quality and their own demand; and billing and payment are simplified.
Bundling therefore appears to be an appropriate product selection strategy for
many digital products, at least for digital information products. Consequently,
some argue that information products should be sold just as newspapers and
cable services are sold: bundled and by subscription.</P>

<P>Although these advantages do favor bundling, a more fundamental
need for bundling newspapers and magazines is technological in nature. In
the physical market, a payment mechanism suitable for purchasing a small
portion of a newspaper simply does not exist. Also, the consumer's cost of disposing
of the unwanted portion of the product is small. Therefore, the economic
costs will also be negligible for any waste generated by bundling. For digital
products, however, neither the disposal cost nor the delivery cost is zero. If a
person subscribes to a digital newspaper but only reads a small portion of what
is delivered, he is paying for the delivery and storage of something he does
not consume. In addition, an indiscriminate broadcasting of digital
newspapers will tax the delivery network, exacerbating congestion. Pricing digital
products need not follow models used in physical markets when, in electronic
commerce, microproducts can be produced according to demand and billed in
an efficient manner based on usage.
</P>

<P>Another questionable assumption is that physical newspapers and
online newspapers are the same product. In fact, online newspapers may be
totally different from their paper counterparts. Online newspapers offer consumers
a different set of characteristics: interactivity, customization, search, links,
and storage and reproduction mechanisms. These characteristics, in turn, result
in different uses. An online newspaper may, for example, be linked to
computer programs that input and analyze news items for investment decisions,
automatic dissemination to colleagues, and so on. You can no longer assume
that online and paper versions are indeed the same commodity.
</P>

<P>The simple fact that consumers pay for a basic cable service, which is
not much different from what is available for free, indicates that cable services
are different from over-the-air television. In addition to better signal quality,
cable television services offer more channels 24 hours a day and access to
specialized
