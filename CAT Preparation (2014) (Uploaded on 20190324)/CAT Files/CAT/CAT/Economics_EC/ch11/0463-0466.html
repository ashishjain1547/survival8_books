CHAPTER 11
</A></H3>

<H2>

Business and Policy Implications<br> of Electronic Commerce

</H2>

<P>Today, commerce on the Internet is frequently equated with the concept
of doing business electronically and is often promoted as a means for
businesses to lower their costs and improve their efficiency in various stages of
business transactions. However, electronic commerce goes beyond the mere adoption
of new Internet technology for conducting business according to
traditional practices. Electronic commerce operates in a new electronic marketplace
where the very players, products and processes are fundamentally changed.
Drawing on insights from previous chapters, this chapter's goal is to summarize
what previous chapters have advanced: the key to understanding and
exploiting electronic commerce is to recognize it as a market mechanism in which
all components of a market interact and must be analyzed collectively.
</P>

<P>With this understanding, this chapter evaluates a number of factors
that traditionally impact costs and efficiency. These include the size of the
firm, product quality, reputation, consumer access to information and
advertising. These and other business factors are intertwined with policy issues. The 
discussion expands to include the impact of electronic commerce on
policies governing new market protection measures, such as digital copyrights,
mass advertising on the Internet, and pricing strategies for digital products.
The discussion of each topic highlights market aspects, which are
consistently
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-464"><P>Page 464</P></A>


<P>
ignored in current debates, and raises issues that will require tackling in
the future as electronic commerce continues to grow.
</P>

<H3><A NAME="ch11_ 2">
11.1. Internet as the Great Equalizer
</A></H3>

<P>In physical markets, the size of a firm impacts its chances for success in
a variety of ways. For example, large firms and corporations often have
better access to the capital market than do small firms. Economies of scale
often result in increased profits for large companies. And the widespread
name recognition of large, established firms is a valuable asset in itself. Such 
advantages&#151;for example, of General Motors over small-scale car
manufacturers&#151;translate into a dominance in physical markets.
</P>

<P>The very different environment of electronic commerce has raised
questions about whether size will have the same impact in this new
marketplace. The virtual existence of companies on the Internet, for instance, makes
it difficult to distinguish physical differences in their size. From this fact alone,  
a notion has developed that the electronic marketplace is the great
equalizer, which accommodates big and small firms on equal terms.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch11_ 3">
The Virtual Equality
</A></H4>

<P>In a physical market, consumers easily recognize the difference between a
posh department store and a discount store by their physical appearances.
However, in the virtual world, physical appearance fails to convey information about
the size and hence relative market position of the store. On the Internet,
anyone with a web page can look as good as a large corporation and can in fact
provide the same level of technical assistance and customer support through
automated programs. Internet users do not know for certain with whom they are
interacting. In fact, a popular cartoon about the net claims that &quot;no one knows you
are a dog on the Internet&quot; (see fig. 8.6). Although there are means to learn
about identities, the Internet provides a reasonable level of anonymity, and
such
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-465"><P>Page 465</P></A>


<P>
anonymity can be useful in social communications, eliminating certain
prejudices when gender-neutral aliases and pronouns are used. But will such
an advantage translate into an economic benefit for companies?</P>
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch11_ 4">
The Reputational Transfer
</A></H4>

<P>Contrary to the popular vision of virtual equality that paints the future
of electronic commerce as a market where the distinction between large and
small becomes moot, there is ample evidence that large firms may dominate
electronic commerce. First of all, a firm with an established reputation in
physical markets may be able to transfer this reputation to the virtual market. To
the extent that the company has established a reputation as a dominant and
large firm in physical markets, this reputation transfer represents a form of
size advantage in electronic commerce as well.
</P>

<P>You can already see evidence of this in electronic commerce. During
the first stage of market growth, small, entrepreneurial firms dominated
the Internet scene. However, a reversal of fortune has become evident in
many product markets. For example, Amazon.com <a href="(http://www.amazon.com)">
(http://www.amazon.com)</A>,
the largest and most successful online bookstore, faces stiff competition
from established booksellers such as Barnes &amp; Noble and
Borders <a href="(http://www.borders.com).">
(http://www.borders.com).</A> In another example, Netscape was the early entrant to
the web-browser market, holding almost 90 percent of the market until the
giant in the physical world entered.  Microsoft's Internet Explorer has
reduced Netscape Navigator's market share by 20 percent in just one year since
its introduction. The question of quality&#151;for example, downloading speed,
ease of use, and features&#151;often becomes secondary to Microsoft's reputation as
the leader in physical markets. In addition, Microsoft can bundle its browser
with its operating system software so that new users inadvertently become its
customers. (For a comprehensive browser comparison, see
C-Net's information page at <a href="http://www.cnet.com/content/reviews/compare/browsers">
http://www.cnet.com/Content/Reviews/Compare/Browsers</A>
/index.html.)
</P>

<P>Other firms native to the Internet will soon face challenges from
physically large firms as well. For example, VeriSign <a href="(http://www.verisign.com)">
(http://www.verisign.com)</A> has
been
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-466"><P>Page 466</P></A>


<P>
the pioneer in certification services. But, the U.S. Postal Service
<a href="(http://www.usps.gov)">
(http://www.usps.gov)</A> intends to enter the certification business, which
requires verification technologies and the public's trust in a third party. Similarly,
many Internet payment services companies will have to compete with large
firms, such as national banks and Visa and MasterCard. Although
Internet-native firms have been small, innovative enterprises, their competitive edge is
being rapidly eroded as large firms with reputation, and the capital, in
physical markets enter the arena. Transferred reputation is clearly one factor that
makes size matter in electronic commerce.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch11_ 5">
Declining Average Costs and the Advantage of Size
</A></H4>

<P>Another reason why size will continue to matter in the electronic
marketplace stems from an economic observation of the process of competition in
digital products. A simplified competition process may take the following
form. Given that a digital product requires a large initial investment to produce
the first unit, the per-unit cost decreases as the number of units sold increases.
In other words, a digital product producer has an increasing economy of
scale&#151;declining average costs&#151;with respect to the number of sales.
Understandably, each firm tries to maximize its market share. For a set quality, producers
can determine the minimum number of sales needed to break even. In the case
of competition among same-quality producers, this break-even price will be
the same for all. Any price below that will increase market share, but the firm
will not break even. If the firm is large enough, and possesses enough capital,
a high-quality producer can cut its price and gain market share, despite losses,
as a temporary strategy to drive out competitors. And as the firm's market
size grows, it can further reduce its price as its average cost declines. Contrary
to the common belief that the Internet is an equalizer of small and large
firms, only firms with sizeable capital may survive a heated competition.
</P>

<P>Because a sizeable market share is necessary to cover the initial fixed cost
of production, the Internet as the &quot;great equalizer&quot; might well be a myth. A
larger firm that can invest more in quality will command a higher share of the
market. If products have the same price, a firm with higher quality will
dominate the market because consumers learn about quality and repeat purchases.
</P>
