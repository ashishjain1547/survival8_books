were to mirror physical markets, a means to establish an identity, such
as driver's licenses or Social Security numbers, would be needed.
Verification services based on digital signatures are being offered, for example, by
VeriSign <a href="(http://www.verisign.com)">
(http://www.verisign.com)</A>, but there is little effort to make such services
a common practice on the Internet. The fact that a commercial enterprise
takes up such an important function is a clear indication of an inadequacy in
governments' priorities.</P>

<H3><A NAME="ch11_ 26">
11.8. Global Framework for Electronic Commerce
</A></H3>

<P>The previous sections have emphasized the need for a new, cohesive
framework within which electronic commerce can function. Complicated as that may
be, a further staggering realization is that not many of the issues touched upon
are local in the digital world. The internationalization of the Internet goes
far beyond any expansion witnessed in the last century. For most of the
20th century, corporations have operated as multinational entities knowing
no national boundaries. Literally, you can see free trade zones springing up
in North America, Europe, and around the Pacific Rim. While these large
economic blocks of countries represent the most recent achievement in
fostering the free movement of goods, the Internet was created from its
inception without borders. For goods and services that can be ordered and delivered
over the network, the Internet is truly a global marketplace.
</P>

<P>As political borders cease to block to trade, global electronic commerce
has implications that reach far beyond mere economic gains from trading.
For example, can nations control the movement of digital goods based on
content or isolate themselves from the rest of the Internet? Can governments
exercise their regulatory powers on the Internet? And how would the effort to set up
a uniform legal and commercial environment for the global electronic
commerce affect physical markets?
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-502"><P>Page 502</P></A>


<H4><A NAME="ch11_ 27">
Convergence in Spatial Markets
</A></H4>

<P>It is easy enough to say that electronic commerce is global. The difficulty lies
in identifying the effects of globalization on the economy&#151;changes in
income levels, jobs, domestic prices, and so on. An interesting exercise in
international trade and finance economics is to observe how two previously closed
economies are affected by subsequent interactions in human resources,
materials, and capital. Even though the soundness of trade was proved via the theory
of comparative advantages, in which trade makes sense even when one
country has absolute advantages in all sectors, the advocates and opponents of
free trade continue to debate other issues. Specifically, does international trade
have an impact on domestic economies? And how would borderless
electronic commerce change that?
</P>

<P>By definition, a closed economy would not be affected by the
international movements of goods and capital. The United States, for example, was
considered relatively closed until the 1970s as its trade accounted for less than
10 percent of its Gross National Product (GNP). With the share increasing
to more than 15 percent, opinions vary as to the impact of trade on the
U.S. economy.
</P>

<P>On one side, the flux of cheap imports into the U.S. is viewed as
equivalent to a huge supply of cheap labor, which depresses low-skilled
workers' income and increases income inequality. Exporting jobs overseas
further creates an oversupply of unskilled labor and affects the laborers' income
adversely. On the other side, competition from foreign labor is greatly
discounted as a factor in the worsening of income inequality. Rather, the blame is put
on domestic policies, especially the introduction of high technology, which
raises the income level of skilled workers while nontechnical workers do not
gain. The argument is that the flight of corporations abroad for cheap labor will
not have a long-term effect because wages in those countries will eventually
be driven up. Low productivity due to the low skill level of domestic workers
is cited as the primary reason the income gap is worsening. For both
sides, creating more jobs domestically will help to narrow the income gap.
However, opponents to free trade argue that expanding job opportunities for
low-skilled
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-503"><P>Page 503</P></A>


<P>
workers and perhaps encouraging more domestic investments by
multinational corporations will raise wages for low-skilled workers. Advocates of free
trade, on the other hand, argue that such policies will have no effect. Rather, the
skill level and the productivity of low-wage earners have to be raised,
perhaps through more job training and education, but not by restricting job exports
by corporations.</P>

<P>The growth of global information infrastructure and its commercial
use cuts through both of these arguments. Through electronic commerce,
high-wage jobs&#151;not just low-wage jobs&#151;are being exported, that is
high-value products are being imported. For example, software engineers in India
work on projects via satellite networks linking directly with U.S. companies.
High-skilled researchers and scientists in Eastern Europe can be linked via
Internet for research purposes. This will depress wages for high-skilled laborers
and should narrow income inequality. At the same time, education and
training will become cheaper through electronic education services on the Internet,
and technological skill and productivity in the electronic marketplace will level
off among workers because the difference between high-tech and low-tech
laborers is smaller than in physical markets. For these reasons, the income gap is
expected to narrow as electronic commerce grows.
</P>

<P>The global nature of electronic commerce will also change how
corporations operate globally, making these corporations more mobile. Shifting
manufacturing abroad is justified when wages are sufficiently different to account
for the cost of relocation. With electronic commerce, that cost will be
smaller, enabling corporations to exploit even small differences in wages. In
essence, this will result in more open economies worldwide and a possible
convergence in income levels.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch11_ 28">
Artificial Borders
</A></H4>

<P>Some governments are not discouraged by the prospect of a globalized
network and believe that movements on the Internet can, as examples show, be
controlled. Through content and access control, minors are protected from
obscene and indecent materials (the Communications Decency Act of 1996
in</P>


<A NAME="PAGENUM-504"><P>Page 504</P></A>


<P>
the U.S.); consumers in some countries are protected from
misinformation and other harmful effects of uninhibited exchange of information
(Ang and Nadarajan, 1996); and a nation (China) can even prevent &quot;spiritual
pollution&quot; by denying access to Internet sites that contain politically sensitive
materials. In other cases, some European governments choose to be isolated by
insisting on local languages as the communications standard instead of English,
which has become the de facto language of the Internet. In this case, languages,
not communications protocols, become the barrier to interoperability.</P>

<P>Imposing control on access and content on the Internet has been an 
important issue in terms of free speech. (See the EFF Censorship and
Free Expression Archive at <a href="http://www.eff.org/pub/censorship/and">
http://www.eff.org/pub/Censorship/and</A>
Government Censorship: the Australian Case at
<a href="http://www.thehub.com.au/~rene/liberty/debate.html.)">
http://www.thehub.com.au/~rene/liberty/debate.html.)</A> But what is the economic side of the debate regarding the
free movement of ideas? Simply, substitute the word &quot;ideas&quot; with &quot;goods.&quot;
Thus, any regulation restricting the free flow of ideas will also restrict the free flow
of goods. By setting up artificial control points on the Internet, governments
can turn traders into smugglers.
</P>

<P>This said, the case of cryptography software illustrates the futility of
controlling movements on the Internet. Cryptography is the main technology
for military intelligence and spying. As such, encryption technologies and
software are designated as defense articles and services&#151;listed on the U.S.
Munitions List or the Commerce Control List&#151;for which exporters need special
licenses from the U.S. State Department or the Department of Commerce (from
the latter for commercial software targeted for mass market). But when
someone uploads such a cryptography program on a U.S. web site, he may be
operating as an exporter without licenses because there is no way to identify and
restrict access by foreigners. The alternative is not to put the programs on the
Internet, or to set up controllable artificial borders. Neither option may be feasible,
and both take away the benefits of an open network.
</P>

<P>The European Union adopted in July, 1995 a Directive on Protection
of Personal Data, which aims to provide a uniform regulatory setting for
gathering and moving personal data such as names, addresses, and credit
worthiness
