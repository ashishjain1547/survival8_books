differentiated products catering to different segments of consumers,
multiple products are desired. These products may be produced by one
producer. However, the costs associated with differentiation and customization
may indicate a lack of scale economies. For application software such as
word processing and spreadsheet programs, differentiation is desirable. Any 
artificial means to standardize such programs will be contrary to
competition and consumer satisfaction. Again, economy of scale will not be the
primary concern.</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch11_ 32">
Interoperability, Standardization, and Market Dominance
</A></H4>

<P>Some of the network effects often mentioned in computer-related
literature concern interoperability rather than network externality.
Interoperability means that two different products can communicate through some common
interface to enable various functions such as swapping disks and files, or using
third-party auxiliary equipment, macro programs, and extensions. Two
interoperable computers can establish a connection with each other; interoperable
word processors can exchange files; interoperable VCRs can read and play the
same video tape; and most electric appliances can interoperate with the
prevailing electric service and add-on equipment. Interoperability is achieved
through standardization, the extent of which is determined by what needs to be
exchanged. For e-mail messages, different operating systems
(OSs)&#151;Windows, MacOS, IBM's OS2, and Unix, for instance&#151;may need to adopt
standard communications protocols. Other features of an operating system need not
be interoperable.
</P>


<P>For example, Microsoft's dominant market position is explained by
computer software tending to favor interoperability and standardization,
with network externality thrown in as well. Microsoft Word files can be
freely exchanged between those who use Windows and Macintosh operating
systems, whereas WordPerfect files lose format when read with Microsoft Word,
and vice versa, even when both programs are run on the same Windows OS.
So,</P>


<A NAME="PAGENUM-514"><P>Page 514</P></A>


<P>
the interoperability has nothing to do with the compatibility of
operating systems but rather is a matter of word-processing programs
having interoperable features. To further illustrate the point, consider electric
toasters. Toasters need at least two standardized features: they have to interface with
the electric power source and they must be able to accept bread slices.
Similarly, word-processing programs need two interface capabilities: they have to
work with an operating system and must be able to accept different files. If
word processors are interoperable, users will have minimal hassles in exchanging
files created in one program into another. Today, such interoperability does
not exist. In a way, the lack of interoperability among word-processing programs
is akin to the inability to plug one hair dryer into another country's
outlet&#151;a problem anyone traveling from the U.S. to Europe has experienced. If
the ability to exchange files is paramount in this age of information, some sort
of interoperability among word-processing programs through standardization
is necessary.</P>

<P>Standardization may be achieved either through standard-setting efforts
or through competition. Standards may be established by defining features
that need to be interoperable for everyone's benefit&#151;for example, for
interchanging files. However, a standard-setting session among competitors may be a
disguised conference for collusion. Especially, the volume of exchanged
messages on the Internet may prove to be a problem in detecting collusive
behaviors among competing firms (Baker, J.B., 1996). On the other hand,
vigorous enforcement to prevent industry collusion may discourage
standard-setting activities (Lemley, 1996). Alternatively, through competition, one
product becomes a de facto standard by dominating the market and forcing all others
to comply with the product's standards. But, its producer is not obligated
to reveal its specifications, unlike the case of industry-wide standard
setting. Should governments require that all de
facto standard products reveal their product specifications to competitors and producers of related products?
This will necessarily involve a complex process of guaranteeing profits for 
the standard-setter, which is far from an improvement over government 
regulations.
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-515"><P>Page 515</P></A>


<P>Standardization does not mean that all competing products have to
be abandoned. It only means that some interoperable features need to be based 
on the standards. How is this different from one product becoming a
dominant product? Through standardization, consumers will have choices
(for example, in programs) with interoperability, whereas left to markets they
may have to face monopoly prices.
</P>

<P>Videocassette competition between Betamax and VHS illustrates
the market's ability to standardize products. Betamax versus VHS is similar
to having two different sizes of floppy disks. When VHS became the
industry standard, however, the result was not one firm producing VCRs. Under
the interoperable standard, the healthy competitive market supports
numerous competitors and lower prices for VCRs. The case of word-processing
programs or operating systems is fundamentally different from Betamax and
VHS standards because the competition in programs and OSs is not about 
standards. Instead, it often involves a variety of products that are
vertically integrated&#151;for example, microprocessors, computer hardware, OSs,
and application programs and contents. You can witness vertically
integrated monopolists in a wide range of product markets, although interoperability
and standardization in no way imply that the computer industry will tend to
be concentrated. Nevertheless, indiscriminate use of interoperability and
standardization to excuse the vertical monopolization process has clouded
understanding of the true nature of this market. Although market-driven
solutions often encourage competition and efficiency without the follies of
artificial government intervention, economists and market analysts need to
provide clearer definitions and analyses of the effects of interoperability,
standardization, and dominance on this multimedia computer industry.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch11_ 33">
Network Externality and Monopolization
</A></H4>

<P>In addition to scale economies and interoperability,
network externalities are often cited to explain the emerging monopolistic market dominance of a
few firms in computer and high-tech industries. As discussed in Chapters 2 and
3, some products, and especially communications networks, are more valuable
if more people use the same product or network. Such an advantage results
in market dominance after a product's market share surpasses a certain
threshold. This section examines the effects of network externalities on market
structure such as monopolization. A firm's monopoly power obtained by this
process&#151;that is, as a result of being a popular or superior product, must be
distinguished from one amassed through anticompetitive behaviors. But, as in
the case of interoperability, network externalities have become a catch-22
for government regulators.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch11_ 34">
Monopoly and Welfare Loss: The Problem
</A></H4>

<P>First, consider why monopolization is seen as harmful. A general result in
the economic theory of firms states that the greatest economic sin of a
monopolist is that it restricts output, and by doing so, raises the price above the
marginal cost of production. Society's resources could be better used if the price
equaled marginal cost, which usually means that more output is desired in the case of
a monopoly.
</P>

<P>Figure 11.2 shows a monopolist's pricing and output decision based
on market demand and cost of production. To maximize its profit, a firm
operates at the output level when its marginal cost is equal to its marginal
revenue (Qm). The next unit will generate less revenue than its production
cost, shrinking its total profit. By producing less, the firm misses the opportunity
to increase its total profit. At the optimal output level (Qm), the market price
is determined by demand (Pm), which is greater than the marginal cost
(MC). The firm's per-unit profit is the difference between the price and the cost 
(Pm _ MC), and the total profit is the shaded area in figure 11.2.
