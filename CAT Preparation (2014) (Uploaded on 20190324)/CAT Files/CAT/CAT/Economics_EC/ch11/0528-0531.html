1997). Although today's TSIN is limited to wholesalers, electronic
commerce will provide a crucial framework for further efforts to include consumer
retailing in electricity as well as in natural gas.</P>

<P>Just as retail wheeling was unimaginable only a few years ago in
regulated utility markets, the infrastructure convergence is opening an era of
competition in numerous monopolistic markets with new types of firms. These
include more specialized firms, a result of disaggregating formerly vertically
integrated firms. On the other hand, regional monopolists are becoming national
competitors through horizontal mergers (for example, SWB and Pacific
Telesis; Nynex and Bell Atlantic) and through integration across different markets
(for example, AT&amp;T's entering regional Bell's markets and vice versa). In
this shuffle, there is a danger of forgetting why society opted for disintegration
and deregulation: to increase competition, lower prices, and raise economic
efficiencies. To avoid a mishap, economic implications of these changes in
market structure must be better understood. For example, if disintegration and
retail wheeling make sense in the utility industry, why is it different to break
up software companies into OS and application software units? If local
exchange networks are common carriers, why would OS vendors not be treated the
same way? Are network externality and interoperability the same forces that
facilitate natural monopoly market structure in the communications and utility
industries? And, should these forces be discarded as they are in the latter?
This section answers some of these questions; others await more in-depth analyses.

11.10.  The Economics of Electronic Commerce and the Internet
</A></H3>

<P>The economics of the Internet as an important use of
telecommunications networks has become a fashionable area of research. The accumulated
knowledge of telecommunications economics is beginning to be applied
vigorously to classical economic problems of resource allocation as well as to policy
issues</P>


<A NAME="PAGENUM-529"><P>Page 529</P></A>


<P>
for Internet communication. Electronic commerce is sometimes
subsumed under this field because researchers erroneously assume that electronic
commerce is just one of the many uses of the Internet infrastructure. This
section clarifies the relationship between the Internet and electronic commerce, and
in doing so, highlights the difference between the economics of the Internet
and the economics of electronic commerce. In brief, the former emphasizes
the nature of communications infrastructure whereas the latter focuses on issues
of digital commodity markets. A further objective is to show the limitations
in defining the economics of the Internet as a part of communications
economics, in which regulatory policies are of paramount interest.</P>



<H4><A NAME="ch11_ 41">
The Economics of Electronic Commerce
</A></H4>

<P>Research in the economics of the Internet is a subfield of
communications economics. Communications economics deals with economic problems
associated with limited resources, such as the telephone network, on which
Internet traffic happens to travel. Although the Internet is based on different
technologies, such as routing and packet switching, it is essentially an alternative use
of the existing telephone network. Accordingly, Internet service pricing,
taxation, and competition among service providers are important topics of research
in determining efficient resource allocation, the profitability of investments
in telecommunications, and proper government policies.
</P>

<P>However, the very nature of Internet communications is changing.
The next generation of Internet traffic may well bypass traditional telephone
or cable networks and connect users via satellites that transmit data directly
into personal computers. Such wireless communications are already beginning
to dominate many business sectors, such as paging services, mobile
telephones, and cable television. With low earth-orbiting satellite networks and
infrared sensors in computers, the infrastructure for the future Internet may bypass
the wired telephone infrastructure. After all these wired and wireless networks
are converted into digital networks and become interoperable, today's
wire-based Internet will be only a small portion of the information infrastructure.
Regardless, the nascent interest among economists is focused on the wired
Internet infrastructure.
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-530"><P>Page 530</P></A>


<P>In contrast, the economics of electronic commerce is concerned with a
new market whose delivery and communication infrastructure happens to be
the Internet. The distinction should be clearly made between digital
product markets and digital delivery infrastructure. To use an analogy, the economics
of the Internet focuses on the workings of the interstate highway system, and
the telephone and mail networks, whereas the economics of electronic
commerce focuses on markets whose transactions are facilitated by
communications networks and delivery systems. The primary focus of the latter is on
product choices, market strategies, prices, and other traditional subjects of
economics within the context of digital products and, equally important, physical
products whose production, marketing, and consumption processes are
affected. Although transportation and communications economics is an
important field, the economics of the Internet, as currently defined and researched,
is only one small part of the economics of electronic commerce.
</P>

<P>The confusion stems from the practice of regarding the Internet
and electronic commerce as equivalent. The Internet, due to its openness
and versatility, is the medium of choice for electronic commerce. However,
any digital communications media will soon be capable of supporting
virtual transactions in the electronic marketplace, including telephone wires,
cables, microwaves, and satellites. Occasionally, commerce on the Internet is
regarded as equivalent to electronic commerce. But the distinguishing characteristic
of electronic commerce is in the way the market is organized and transactions
are carried out: by virtual market agents, digital products, and electronic
market processes. The economics of electronic commerce aims to analyze
fundamental changes in market processes and products. Such an innovative market can
exist and function regardless of the infrastructure on which it is based. The
Internet, in essence, is only a transitory infrastructure on which the electronic
marketplace has been launched.
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-531"><P>Page 531</P></A>


<H4><A NAME="ch11_ 42">
The Economics of Information Infrastructure
</A></H4>

<P>The development of the information infrastructure, of which the
Internet is one element, poses many technological and economic problems. To
make the infrastructure a reality, technologies in varying and competing
industries such as telephone, cable, private commercial information services, EDI,
and various wireless communications will have to be interoperable. At the
same time, simple equipment, such as cable modems, which enable Internet users
to connect via cable, and digital switches, are taking more time and effort
to develop than expected. Communications protocols and other product
standards, such as video and audio compression, languages for web documents
and applets, and digital currency have to be worked out among increasingly
numerous and diverse participants. The dominance of the TCP/IP protocol
as the communications standard was a happy consequence of its
popularity among Internet users. The Internet's popularity made it the heavyweight
in comparison with private online services, which first attempted to
compete with the Internet and failed. As a result, the Internet has become
synonymous with information infrastructure. But, as business interest intensifies, its
future might not be as smooth as its past.
</P>

<P>Numerous economic issues also pose threats to the future of
information infrastructure. Flat-rate pricing for online services raised the specter of
congestion and inefficiency. Local telephone companies and Internet service
providers are fighting a battle over access charges. Governments are
contemplating various forms of taxes and tariffs for Internet services and transactions.
</P>

<P>Economists who are primarily interested in network economics are
ana-lyzing these issues because such issues arise naturally in
telecommunications networks. While the information infrastructure is evolving from its
dependence on wired telecommunications networks to a more diverse mixture
of infrastructure including cable and wireless networks, the economics of
Internet infrastructure remains focused on traditional problems of a wired
telephone</P>
