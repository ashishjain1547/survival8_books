control measures such as permits, requirements, and regulations so that
they can extend their locus of control over Internet commerce, or they should
give special treatment to electronic commerce and look for other venues for
tax. Each choice will have a substantially different effect on the future
development of electronic commerce. A more detailed discussion of taxation issues can
be found in Chapter 11.

Internet Sales Tax Permit?
</B>
</CENTER>


<BLOCKQUOTE>
To open a business of any kind, one needs to obtain a sales tax permit and register
business names with counties in which one intends to operate. Necessary permits must
be obtained depending on the type of product handled. Financial and accounting
records must be kept and sales taxes must be reported periodically.
<BR>

<BR>To open an Internet business, however, one only needs to get an Internet account
through an ISP (Internet Service Provider), and open up a web page announcing business.
Although one can register a domain name, a sort of store name, it is not required. In
fact, Internet domain names have been given out on a &quot;first-come, first-served&quot; basis.
Legal issues in terms of trademarks are just beginning to be contested. And what are the
procedures for recording and reporting sales and accounting figures? How do accounting
firms audit electronic transaction records? For such aspects of business, public
policymaking, as well as private entrepreneurial solutions, need to be explored.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The nature of Internet communication also compounds many
legislative and legal efforts going on at the national and international level to adapt to 
the new electronic environment. For example, one contentious issue taken 
up in Chapter 5 is how copyrights of content owners should be protected
in the digital age. The primary concern about copyrights is linked to the
sellers' and buyers' access to the same production technologies that enable
mass reproduction and mass distribution of any digital product without
quality degradation. Prohibiting or limiting the use of the technology is clearly not 
the solution. Rather, every aspect of production, sales, and distribution has
to be analyzed and redefined before a proper and effective legal framework can 
be created.
</P>
<A NAME="PAGENUM-34"><P>Page 34</P></A>



<P>The challenge is very real. Detecting pirate copies of books or
sound recordings is relatively easy compared to discerning digital copying and
distribution over an open network. Besides many difficulties in copyright
enforcement, there is substantial difficulty in defining what constitutes a
legitimate copy. Traditionally, copy is protected if a work is fixed in a substantially
permanent medium. Is a screen display or a CD-ROM cache permanent enough
to merit copyright control? And because viewing a file on-screen involves
transferring of the file, should all file browsing be regarded as copyright
infringement? How different is web browsing from browsing a book in a
bookstore? These and a long list of other questions remain to be resolved.
</P>

<P>For example, at the international level, differences in copyright laws
across countries and even between two international copyright conventions,
the Berne Convention and the UCC, must be reconciled. While illegal piracy
may be dealt with using trade sanctions authorized under General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and other trade agreements, the Internet
simply supercedes all political jurisdictions, making it harder to cope with
through traditional trade negotiations, which are often lengthy and ineffective.
On another note, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD) raises the issue of maintaining linguistic and cultural diversity in
the face of dominant use of English as the Internet language. But by using
a different language, one community may end up isolating itself from a
variety of information that will negate many of the benefits of information exchange.
</P>

<P>Although there is a definite void in terms of adequate legal protection
in electronic commerce, hasty legislation is not the answer. Take, for example,
the consequences of one attempted solution. The problem is that it is possible
for hackers to set up their computers to impersonate other sites receiving
and sending messages, while their correspondents are not aware of the true
identity of their partners. To prevent this kind of fraud, called
spoofing, on the Internet, a new Georgia law makes it a crime to falsely identify oneself or to
direct others to unintended sites. Poorly worded, the law may also prohibit any
links on a web page. While the zeal of public officials to use legislation to
address open network problems is understandable, any effort to apply legal
control
</P>

<P>
blindly to the digital medium is misguided unless law makers understand
how the Internet communication works and consider all the ramifications of
simply incriminating network activities.

<P>Recent controversies over the public availability of highly uncrackable 
encryption technology such as Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)
<a href="http://web.mit.edu/network/pgp.html">
(http://web.mit.edu/network/pgp.html)</A> and the Communications Decency Act (Title V of
the Telecommunications Act of 1996) for the Internet have shown how difficult it
is to impose control over the digital network. However, it is prudent to
remember that proactive laws are seldom effective when the environment they intend
to regulate is continuously evolving. In fact, they often have detrimental effects
on its development. The Internet and the electronic marketplace have
many strengths, but require understanding and nurturing instead of control
and regulation.

1.4.Current Issues in Electronic Commerce
</A></H3>

<P>Now that we have defined electronic commerce as a market and examined
its characteristics of the marketplace, you may be enjoying a sense that it
is smooth sailing from here to harnessing the enormous potential of this
new world. However, basic questions remain regarding how the commodity,
sellers, and buyers will actually come together in a market that still lacks many
essential features necessary for secure commercial transactions. While
current debates on electronic commerce issues focus on legal or technological
aspects, our goal in this section is to review and highlight the economic aspects of
these and other issues.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch01_ 18">
Contents and Quality
</A></H4>

<P>In any market, traditional or electronic, uncertainty regarding the quality
of products can lead to the collapse of that market. Although the Internet
provides a wide variety of services and is used by millions, there is still a
noticeably
</P>
<A NAME="PAGENUM-36"><P>Page 36</P></A>


<P>
wide gap between the number of commercial products and services that
could easily be digitized and those that are currently offered on the Internet.
Some see this as a sign of the reluctance of content owners to participate in
electronic commerce and a signal of a reduction in the overall quality of what is
available on the Internet. For physical products, consumers may prefer to inspect
products and actually try them out instead of looking at a picture or reading
a description. Lacking a proper means to verify quality, commercial
opportunities may be limited to a few whose quality consumers already know about
or can easily learn online. Online banking and travel services are two examples
for which consumers are already familiar with electronic processing and
purchasing. For others, online markets may not materialize at all.

<P>Although copyright protection is an important legal issue, and one that
is doubtlessly connected with product quality, there is a more
fundamental reason drawn from economics that helps to explain why products of
high quality may not be offered on the Internet: uncertainty about product
quality stemming from asymmetric information. Quite simply, when consumers
do not have adequate information about product quality, their willingness to
pay depends on the expected level of quality. For example, if there is an
equal chance of getting a good product worth $100 or a bad product worth
$50, buyers are willing to pay, on average, $75. Being an average, consumers
break even in the long run by paying $75 for this product. To put it differently,
$25 benefits the consumers who get a good product and evens out with $25
losses by those who receive a bad product.
</P>

<P>Consumers may be persuaded to pay more than $75 if sellers are able
to convince them that their products are indeed of high quality. Without
such information or guarantee, a seller cannot charge more than $75. If the cost
of producing a good product exceeds $75&#151;the expected price in the
market&#151;then a seller of a high-quality product will do better not to sell the
product. Further, if the number of bad products exceeds the number of good
products, consumers' willingness to pay diminishes as the expected&#151;average&#151;level
of quality decreases. If there are only bad products in the market, the only
possible market price will be $50. As high-quality products withdraw from
the market, this leaves the market with low-quality goods, that is,
lemons.
