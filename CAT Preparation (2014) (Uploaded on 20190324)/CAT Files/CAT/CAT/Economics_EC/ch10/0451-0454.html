ing settlement. Just as you see Visa, MasterCard, and other credit card
logos on a merchant's door, web pages will be strewn with electronic logos
informing consumers of optional payment systems honored at their sites.
Each consumer and merchant must open an account with CyberCash or
other payment services offered in the market. Does this represent any
improvement over physical markets? In this regard, digital credit cards using an
industry standard such as SET may have an advantage over using numerous
NFT intermediaries, each issuing their versions of electronic wallets.
However, credit card-based systems simply extend existing payment networks to
the Internet, which may be sufficient for old models of business. As
electronic commerce demands new kinds of products and consumption
behaviors, electronic payment systems must also reflect these changes. For example,
a cost-effective micropayment system will be needed for microbundles
and microsales of information products. Even for this purpose alone,
digital currency and its related market infrastructure should be nurtured.
</P>

<P>Left alone to markets, various forms of electronic payment systems
will differentiate by price, convenience and quality. Price certainly will be
determined by the difference between the cost of providing an electronic
payment service and the cost of using a conventional system&#151;or the consumer's
willingness to pay given this opportunity cost. In terms of transaction costs,
online transactions must be far more efficient to generate enough spread
between the two options. Thus, efficiency gains are turned into profit
opportunities. However, this ignores consumers' willingness to pay, which may very
well increase because of convenience, anonymity and other factors that are
not available offline. Greater willingness to pay will support electronic
payment systems that may  increase transaction costs. The major challenges of
electronic payment systems are not in reducing transaction costs or
perfecting security but in producing usage values to gain consumer acceptance
and devising efficient pricing strategies for various payment intermediaries.
For the Mondex system, (Clemons et al., 1997) identify various ways to
charge consumers for its service: selling cards, renting cards, charging a fee for
bank-to-card transfer, charging a fee for currency-to-Mondex exchange, or
discounting when Mondex currencies are traded for outside monies. For

<P>
currency, what is known as seigniorage can be a source of profit. Because
this involves monetary policies, banking regulation and international
currency exchanges, this chapter concludes by examining the role of governments
in promoting digital currency.</P>

<H3><A NAME="ch10_ 33">
10.7. Digital Currency and Governments
</A></H3>

<P>After being created, digital currency can be traded on the global
Internet, meaning that digital currency is necessarily an international issue. It is
not unimaginable that you will see the last of foreign currency trading due
to global digital currency. Equally likely, however, is that digital currencies
may add to the number of existing international units of money, further
complicating foreign exchange rates and trading.
</P>

<P>Despite these potentially serious impacts, the U.S. government's
attitude toward digital currency is one of non-interference and sometimes one
of promotion. The reasons for this policy can be summarized from recent
remarks by the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan (1996). First, in
an environment without government intervention, private businesses are
motivated to self-regulate. As firms compete for reputation and strive to
inform consumers of their quality, they have ample incentive for self-regulation
and industry-wide cooperation. Second, innovations mandated by
governments often differ from market-driven solutions. The viability of any new
product, such as a digital currency, must be proven in the marketplace by
consumers and merchants rather than by policymaking bodies. Together, these
rationales favor non-interference in the development of digital money.
</P>

<P>This said, governments play an important role, by choice or by
necessity, in several areas. The first issue demanding a closer examination is the
possible reduction in government revenue due to private monies. Second, there
are various regulatory issues involving consumer protection and law
enforcement issues, such as money laundering, that demand government attention.
Third,
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-453"><P>Page 453</P></A>


<P>
the legal and monetary ramifications of who can issue digital currency
warrant closer attention by the government. Finally, a government action
may have no impact on the Internet because an online operator can simply ship
its operation to a server in another country, often involving no physical
relocation.</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch10_ 34">
Effects on Government Revenues
</A></H4>

<P>Money is exchanged with goods and services of equal value except when it
is issued by the government, which gains from the difference between the cost 
of printing a dollar and the value of a dollar, known as the seigniorage.
The government derives further revenue  from dollar currency held by
consumers, which amounts to interest-free lending to the government by the
public&#151;a privilege often abused by excessive printing. In 1994, most of the
$20 billion generated by the Federal Reserve could be accounted for by
the government's privilege to print money (Blinder, 1994). Thus, when
private monies are issued, they take away some portion of the government's
revenue related to seigniorage and other currency operations.
</P>

<P>As long as a national government is the only currency issuer, its
revenue related to seigniorage is the monopoly profit. If private firms are allowed
to print money, the profit will be shared with these firms. The dollar is
accepted by the public because of the public's confidence in the U.S.
government. Likewise, the acceptance of private money will depend on the public's trust
in the companies who issue the money. This does not mean that private
companies will appropriate profits that previously were the government's
revenues. Whether the profit is kept by them or is distributed to consumers will
depend on the competitiveness in the currency industry. If, for example, online
banks compete by paying interest on digital currency deposits, the interest paid
to depositors is the seigniorage now being appropriated by governments.
The competition among issuers may well drive the private profit to a level where
a significant portion of the monopoly profit currently enjoyed by
governments is instead given to consumers in the form of convenience, service, and quality.
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-454"><P>Page 454</P></A>



<H4><A NAME="ch10_ 35">
Regulatory Issues
</A></H4>

<P>Governments play a role in a wide range of regulatory issues regarding
the use of currency. Using the example of the U.S., this section discusses in
detail how a current reading of relevant regulations and laws highlights the need
for governments to resolve any uncertainty regarding the use of digital currency.
</P>

<P>First, in terms of consumer protection, the Electronic Fund Transfer
Act (EFTA) and its Federal Reserve implementation rules, known as
Regulation E, determine the rights and responsibilities of consumers and financial
institutions. EFTA and Regulation E establish the rights, liabilities, and
responsibilities of parties in EFTs involving consumers. For example, under EFTA,
consumers are liable only to a maximum of $500 for unauthorized use of
a stolen or lost credit card. Further, this regulation establishes consumers'
rights regarding account disputes, damages, and losses. However, these
regulations are limited to EFTs and do not seem to cover, as written now,
electronic currency because digital currency is not &quot;transfer information&quot; but
rather money itself. Instead, if you lose a balance on your Mondex card, for
example, the issuer must provide consumers with remedies. The terms of
remedies will most likely need to be disclosed before consumers purchase
digital currency. However, disclosure rules governed by EFTA and Regulation E
also do not extend to digital currency. Unlike services based on dollar
currency, digital currency intermediaries will have to assure consumers of their
quality and reliability to succeed in the market. Through competition, it is likely
that an assortment of digital currency will be offered to exploit various needs
of transaction, with prices reflecting the degree of reliability and convenience.
</P>

<P>Second, government agencies require banks to keep records and
file reports on certain types of currency transactions to detect and counter
money laundering and other criminal activities. The government's control
over money
