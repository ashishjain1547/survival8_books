of the Securities Exchange Commission's Electronic Data Gathering,
Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR).
</P>
<P>The Securities and Exchange Commission <a href="(http://www.sec.gov)">
(http://www.sec.gov)</A>
requires public companies to file information that it must make available to the
public. The SEC defines EDGAR <a href="(http://www.sec.gov/edgarhp.htm)">
(http://www.sec.gov/edgarhp.htm)</A>, shown in
figure 9.4, as a system that performs automated collection, validation,
indexing, acceptance, and forwarding of submissions by companies. Its purpose is
to increase the efficiency and to ensure the fairness of the securities market
by making time-sensitive corporate information available to investors. The type
of information found on EDGAR includes annual reports (Form 10K),
quarterly reports (Form 10Q), proxy statements (annual reports to shareholders)
and other reports voluntarily filed by companies. Since the SEC has phased
in electronic filing of required forms, retrieval and search by individuals
has become immediate, convenient, and cost-effective.
</P>

<P>A question immediately arises: how can information sellers make
profits when investors have convenient access to primary sources of information?
One way is to focus on processing the information; that is, the information
sellers filter available information and present it in a form customers find useful.
In the age of information overload, the amount of information is no longer
as important as the effective filtering and selection of relevant information
(see section 7.5 for information filtering).
</P>

<P>The problem of externality remains, however. In general, the
information seller has to limit subscribership. Even with limited subscribership, the
window of opportunity for an information seller may be small because market
prices tend to reflect the information investors have and others who simply
observe prices can deduce the content of the information. In short, information
trading does not add much value when the information infrastructure and
market is as efficient as in electronic commerce. To control the use of information
and to extract the most surplus from consumers requires bundling
information services with other financial services, as shown in Chapter 8.

Certification and Assurance
</A></H4>

<P>Although information is clearly disseminated more efficiently in
electronic commerce, this efficiency does not increase the reliability of the
information. Unreliable information about borrowers and investment projects, even
when obtained efficiently, is still unreliable. The problem is compounded because
of the nature of digital communication, in which no established means of
online verification is available. Information provided on a web page may be as
reliable and authentic as it is bogus. Even establishing the identity of a seller or a
buyer requires an elaborate procedure. In the future, e-mail addresses may become
as easily identifiable as a postal address or a phone number, or online
transactions may be conducted via video phones with digitized driver's licenses. Until
then, temporary solutions are offered by new types of financial intermediaries,
called certification authorities, which are appearing to address the verification
problems peculiar to electronic commerce.
</P>

<P>A certification authority (CA) is a public or private entity that issues
digital certificates to be used by sellers and buyers to authenticate identities
and messages, or to attest that a deed has occurred. In physical markets,
checking an ID or a signature is usually enough to establish identity and trust
among traders. However, in an electronic market, where face-to-face interactions
are
</P>
<A NAME="PAGENUM-395"><P>Page 395</P></A>


<P>
replaced by electronic messages, even the identity of an e-mail sender
cannot be easily verified. A CA, therefore, acts as a trusted third party who
issues digital IDs and other certificates that use strong encryption technologies
to prevent tampering (see the following sidebar, &quot;Types of Digital Certificates&quot;).
</P>

Types of Digital Certificates
</B>
</CENTER>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Froomkin (1997) identifies the following four types of certificates likely to be issued
by CAs:
<BR>

<BR>Identifying Certificates Identifying certificates, or
digital IDs, attest to the identity of a person. A leading provider of digital IDs is VeriSign, Inc. <a href="(http://www.verisign.com)">
(http://www.verisign.com)</A>,
a spin-off of the encryption technology firm RSA Data Security, Inc.
<a href="(http://www.rsa.com).">
(http://www.rsa.com).</A> VeriSign offers different levels of digital IDs, ranging from Class 1 identifying
certificates, which verify only the uniqueness of a name or e-mail address without
contacting the person, to Class 4 indentifying certificates, which are issued after VeriSign
investigates the person thoroughly and personally.
<BR>

<BR>Authorizing Certificates Whereas an identifying certificate connects a person with
a name, authorizing certificates verify attributes of a person other than the identity.
Such attributes may include the age of a person, whether the person is a citizen of the U.S.
or belongs to a certain membership group, or whether the person owns a car or other
products. An example of using authorizing certificates is when adult-only materials are sold
to those who present &quot;over-18&quot; certificates. Although the same goal might be achieved
via an identifying certificate, authorizing certificates maintain the anonymity of the buyer.
<BR>

<BR>Transactional Certificates Transactional certificates attest that a certain fact or
incident has occurred and been witnessed by the attester. For example, when an e-mail is to
be certified, a CA may attached a digital signature verifying that the e-mail was indeed
sent by the person. This is most akin to the certification provided by public notary services.
<BR>

<BR>Time-Stamping Services If it is important to show not only that something took
place but also when, a time stamp can be added to a document based on its hash value
(see sidebar, &quot;Cryptography and Electronic Commerce&quot;). By linking the unique hash
value of a document with a published hash value (for example, in
The New York Times), it can be verified not only whether the document was modified but also when.
</BLOCKQUOTE>


<P>The reliability of digital certificates depends heavily on the strength of
the cryptographic technologies employed, which is why VeriSign is a
natural
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-396"><P>Page 396</P></A>


<P>
extension of RSA Data Security's cryptographic business. In general, public
key encryption and digest function (see sidebar, &quot;Cryptography and
Electronic Commerce&quot;) are two important technologies that enable digital signatures
and time stamping.
</P>
<P>As far as identification is concerned, commercial certification services <BR>
may have a disadvantage compared to established businesses and
government agencies that are already engaged in some type of identification
function&#151;issuing and assigning for Social Security, sales tax permits, driver's
licenses, postal addresses, phone numbers, and so on. After various ID systems
are digitized in a way to give these entities some advantage, private
certification services may focus on non-identification functions such as transactional
certificates and time stamping.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
An encrypted message is a plain-text document that is scrambled to keep its
contents secret. An encryption scheme scrambles the text; a
decryption scheme unscrambles an encrypted text. Encryption schemes are typically based on mathematical algorithms
and keys. For example, suppose you replace every letter in a document with the letter
that comes three places after it in the alphabet; for example, replace &quot;A&quot; with &quot;D,&quot; &quot;B&quot;
with &quot;E,&quot; and so on. &quot;Replacing with another letter&quot; is your
encryption algorithm and the number &quot;three&quot; is your
encryption key. Julius Caesar reportedly first used this
algorithm and key more than 2,000 years ago. The same encryption algorithm may have
different keys, for example, the key of &quot;four&quot; means that you replace &quot;A&quot; with &quot;E&quot; instead of &quot;D.&quot;
<BR>

<BR>Encryption schemes can be divided into two classes:
secret key and public key. Secret key schemes depend on securing the secrecy of the key used to encrypt and decrypt a
message. There are many problems with this scheme, the main one being if the key is
discovered. In this case, there is a key exchange problem because new keys must be
relayed securely every time keys are changed. Public
key schemes, on the other hand, use one key to encrypt (a public key), which is published or given out freely, and another to
decrypt (a private key), which is kept secret. These two keys are mathematically related to
an encryption algorithm, and a message encrypted by a public key must be decrypted by
its associated private key, and vice versa.
<BR>

<BR>The public key system is quite simple to implement. Suppose Alice and Bob want
to communicate securely. Both publish their public keys, keeping their private keys
secret. When Alice wants to send a secret message to Bob, she uses Bob's public key to encrypt,
