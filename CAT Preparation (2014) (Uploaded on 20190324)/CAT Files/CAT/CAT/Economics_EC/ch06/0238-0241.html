<P>
After consumers find their match, advertising builds brand loyalty and
increases the firm's market power. Also, a firm's advertising is bound to
inform some consumers that its product does not match their tastes. In a
simplified market with two firms, one firm's advertising is beneficial to its competitor&#151;
a type of public good (Meurer and Stahl, 1994). Eaton and Grossman
(1986) have also shown that informative advertising actually reduces price
competition among firms; thus consumer welfare is lowered despite a better preference-product matching. The loss to consumers is due to a higher
price; as a result, there is an incentive for firms to provide excessive
informative advertising (Grossman and Shapiro, 1984).
</P>

<P>Does advertising affect product differentiation
itself? In some cases, advertising can result in spurious product differentiation by which consumers
are persuaded to think, albeit mistakenly, that there are differences in
competing products. Many over-the-counter drugs and household chemicals have
essentially the same ingredients but consumers perceive them to be different
largely because of advertising.
</P>

<P>When products are vertically differentiated (for example, by
quality), truthful advertising may solve the lemons problem discussed in Chapter 4
by signaling quality. If all buyers are informed about product quality, a
high- quality good should command a higher price than a low-quality good.
If advertising is truthful and credible, higher price means higher quality.
</P>

<P>Prices, however, are an imperfect indicator of quality. If buyers are
unable to assess the quality of a product, either price or advertising can supply
some information. Will a product that is either priced high or advertised
heavily really be a high quality product? As an empirical case study, Caves and
Greene (1996) calculated the rank correlation between product quality ratings,
prices, and advertising outlays for approximately 200 products. They found a
weak correlation between prices and quality and no significant relationship
between advertising and quality. In other words, advertising is not a reliable signal
for quality. They also report that the price-quality correlation is most notable 
for convenience products such as frequently purchased consumption
goods. For these products, firms have an incentive to maintain a high-quality
</P>

<P>
corresponding to a high price in order to ensure repeat purchases. But
the overall weak relationship between advertising and quality is consistent with
the observation that advertising is mostly persuasive. For experience goods
whose quality must be learned, advertising cannot supply any information about
the product quality but must instead persuade consumers to try out a product.
For digital products, being experience goods, advertising will be more
persuasive than informative, which further diminishes the value of advertising as a
signal for quality.
</P>

6.3.Other Strategies to Convey Product <BR>
Information
</A></H3>

<P>Providing product information through advertising and other direct means
to verify product quality is effective for search goods. For experience
goods, however, no amount of advertising can settle the question of quality. A
conventional method to counter the quality uncertainty is to provide a
guarantee for quality or a refund. Another important mechanism is to build a
brand name and seller-specific reputation. This section reviews these &quot;non-
advertising&quot; means to convey product information and evaluates how
the nature of digital products affects their effectiveness in the electronic
marketplace.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch06_ 15">
Repeat Purchases and Reputation
</A></H4>

<P>Reputation is strategically important when a firm is a long-run player or if
a product is purchased repeatedly. A recognizable brand name is built over
a period of time if a consumer's expectation for quality is consistently
fulfilled. For products that are used only once, the reputation is built for the firm
rather than the product, so that firm-specific reputation becomes the &quot;brand
name&quot; by which the firm may transfer a consumer's trust from product to
product. When both products and firms are short-lived, neither the brand name nor
the firm's reputation resolves the quality uncertainty.
</P>
<A NAME="PAGENUM-240"><P>Page 240</P></A>



<H4><A NAME="ch06_ 16">
Reputation Building in Electronic Commerce
</A></H4>

<P>Short-run players invest little in reputation. A shop selling mainly to
tourists, for example, has little incentive to maintain its reputation of selling a
certain quality consistently. Reputation pays off when consumers and firms intend
to stay in the market for the long haul. Internet commerce is relatively new
and there is no clear long-run profit incentives to induce heavy investment
in reputation. Some Internet services, however, are already recognized as
essential for the success of electronic commerce. In those areas of service, the
clear winners are the ones who have built some reputation. The success of
Yahoo! <a href="http://www.yahoo.com">
(http://www.yahoo.com)</A> as the leader in search services, for example,
depends largely on its reputation as a pioneer. In certification and security services,
RSA Data Security, Inc. <a href="http://www.rsa.com">
(http://www.rsa.com)</A> is the front-runner due to its
reputation in cryptography technologies (see fig. 6.6). Visitors at RSA Data
Security, Inc. are informed that the firm's product is the world's brand name for
cryptography, is implemented in many familiar products, and is the de
facto standard on the Internet. The firm's selling point is its reputation.
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-241"><P>Page 241</P></A>



<P>Although these Internet-native firms have built their reputation based
on new products, firms with an established reputation in physical markets may
be able to transfer their firm-specific reputation to the electronic
marketplace. Microsoft <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">
(http://www.microsoft.com)</A> and
IBM <a href="http://www.ibm.com">
(http://www.ibm.com)</A> try to use their reputations and brand names in physical markets as an entry
strategy to Internet commerce. This may give them an advantage over new
Internet-native firms and, if successful, signal a possible dominance by existing firms
in the new marketplace. Such transferred reputation, however, needs to be
reinforced by continued approval by consumers in terms of products and
services in the new market. Thus, in electronic commerce, the value of
transferred reputation may be short-lived if product quality is not met consistently.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch06_ 17">
Renting a Reputation
</A></H4>

<P>A firm-specific reputation is an example in which the reputation built by
one quality product is transferred to other products sold by the same seller. A
seller without a reputation can use such reputation spill-over to rent the
reputation of others. Suppose, for example, that Alice is a retailer of computer
software with a reputation for high quality. Bob enters the software market with a
new product. Having no reputation of his own, Bob must induce buyers to try
his products, perhaps with promotional low prices or by offering free
demo versions. An alternate strategy for Bob is to sell his software through
Alice (Chu and Chu, 1994). Similarly, many foreign car manufacturers sell
their automobiles under American brands. Thus, renting a reputation can be used
as an entry strategy when products are experience goods and the sellers do
not have a reputation.
</P>

<P>In electronic commerce, renting a reputation can be used more
widely because sellers of digital products are more diverse and short-lived than
in physical markets. Suppose, for example, that you want to sell an article
you have written. As a short-term player or a micro-product seller, you have
little incentive to invest in reputation building. A viable strategy is to sell
your articles through a reputable intermediary, for example
CNN <a href="http://www.">
(http://www.</A>
cnn.com) or The New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com.">
(http://www.nytimes.com).</A> As
long-run players, these intermediaries have an incentive to maintain their
reputation.
