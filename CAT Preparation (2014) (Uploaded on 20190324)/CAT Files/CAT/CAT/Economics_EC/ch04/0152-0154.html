<P>
which is higher than the expected market price. Thus, try outs, if available,
can be used to resolve the quality uncertainty.
</P>
<P>Some products are ill suited for try-outs. Suppose, for example, that
Alice is selling a computer database of weather information for all major U.S.
cities, and allows her customers to search for one city prior to purchase. Bob,
who wants to get information about the weather in San Francisco, can get the
data for San Francisco by using the try-out and then decline to buy the
database. Two mechanisms may become important in such a situation. First, Alice
may devise a demonstration plan, by which Bob can be convinced of the
database's quality without revealing any information from the database. Such a plan
is based on an algorithm known as zero-knowledge proofs. (See section 6.2 for
a detailed discussion on zero-knowledge proofs). Second, micropayment
methods may adequately address Bob's need, and in general support
unbundled sales of digital products. Although bundling of many related products will
be essential for information and digital products, microsales and microbundles
are useful in allowing consumers to try out without relying on free give-aways.
</P>

<P>For some products, consumers may not be sure of their quality even
after try-outs. For others, try-outs may not be available for all features of a
product, or may take time and costly effort to learn. Still others are technically
too complex for consumers to evaluate their features. In these cases, an
expert evaluation may be needed.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch04_ 10">
Third-Party Information
</A></H4>

<P>In addition to the direct seller-buyer information channels considered so far,
 intermediaries may be essential to resolving the issue of quality
uncertainty. For some products, a certain degree of technical knowledge is needed
to understand and evaluate various product specifications. Although a
well-designed web page may have FAQs and links to related sites and papers
for consumers to read about technical aspects of a product, not all consumers
are equipped to digest this information. Therefore, someone with technical
expertise is needed who can provide objective quality evaluation. And as an
objective evaluation of a product often involves a comparison with
competing products, a third party other than sellers and buyers is often preferred.
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-153"><P>Page 153</P></A>



<P>Third-party intermediaries can be separated into two groups: public
and private. Public third parties have no profit motive and may be supported
by public funds. Private third parties, on the other hand, provide information
for a fee as their business.
</P>

<P>Public third parties include a wide array of very different institutions
and organizations. Newspapers, magazines, and television news programs
often review and rate digital products and web sites. Personal web pages that
provide assorted links by subject are in fact reviewed and evaluated by
individuals. Similarly, many Internet sites are touted as being a &quot;top 5 percent&quot; web
site, and display some kind of award. Search services maintain &quot;What's Hot&quot;
lists that are reviewed and rated. As long as these services are offered as a
public service, they may be classified as public third-party activities.
</P>

<P>Public third parties, however, are often limited in their service because
of the nature of public goods. Objective product information is a public
good useful to all members of a society, but the organization or firm producing
the information cannot charge those who benefit from the information. As
a result, public goods tend to be undersupplied. Because of high costs,
Consumer Reports, for example, cannot provide its valuable service for all products on
the market. Third parties such as government agencies, industry organizations,
and consumer advocacy groups also try to establish certain quality standards
that can be applied to all products in the market. Standards set up by
government or industry groups, for example, often dictate the minimum level of
quality and technical capabilities such as UL sets for electric appliances and
government safety standards set for automobiles. These minimum standards are
often minimally useful in determining what to buy, however, because all
reasonable products on the market have supposedly exceeded the minimum. As
such, their usefulness is limited.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch04_ 11">
Retailers and Other Brokers
</A></H4>

<P>Alternatively, market organizations such as retailers and brokers who
have incentives to maximize profits may offer product evaluation. A profit-
motivated intermediary is a private third party who sells information as
a
</P>
<A NAME="PAGENUM-154"><P>Page 154</P></A>


<P>
product. As it is a long-run player, the intermediary has an incentive to
review products and be truthful to consumers to maintain its reputation. Whether
its information is in fact efficient and truthful will depend on the way the
market rewards the intermediary's activities.
</P>
<P>If public organizations cannot provide adequate public information,
how could one expect private, profit-oriented third parties to provide
objective information for the benefit of consumers? And how does one determine
that their information is true? Economically, one must also be concerned with
the level of information provided&#151;that is, whether it is efficient, too much, or
too little. These questions can be answered by analyzing market incentives
that determine the level of services these intermediaries offer. This section
first defines what these intermediaries are and then presents a detailed analysis
in the next section.
</P>

<P>For this discussion, private third parties are defined as intermediaries
such as retailers who are not producers but who may convey quality information
to consumers as a part of their business activities. They offer both direct
and indirect quality information. Direct information is conveyed when they
guarantee the quality of the product they distribute. Measures to support
product guarantee such as unlimited return policy, however, may be difficult to
implement in electronic commerce. First and foremost, digital products, for
example, can be copied so easily that physically &quot;returning&quot; a product has
little meaning. Second, refunds may not be feasible for items purchased
with micropayments whose transaction costs may be larger than the value of
those products.
</P>

<P>Indirect information is transmitted to consumers through the identity
and reputation of the third parties themselves. Building reputation is
profitable when consumers repeat purchases and as long as high-quality goods
command higher prices (Shapiro, 1982). When consumers are not expected to
repeat purchases, however, reputable firms have little advantage over
fly-by-night operators. A disadvantage of sellers in the electronic marketplace is that
indirect quality signals available in conventional markets have little or no
meaning. Buyers can often judge the quality of a product, for example, from the
appearance of a store or the identity of a seller. A posh department store offers
better
