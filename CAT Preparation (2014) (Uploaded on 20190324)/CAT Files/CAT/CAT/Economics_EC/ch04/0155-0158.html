quality, albeit pricey, products than a discount store. In a virtual market
where physical presence has little relevance, however, these indirect
information signals are not available or undergo radical changes. Clearly, the role of
intermediaries and their effectiveness in conveying just such quality information
in electronic commerce is a complex topic that this discussion has only begun
to explore.
</P>

<H3><A NAME="ch04_ 12">
4.3. Quality and Intermediaries
</A></H3>

<P>The need for an intermediary is often dismissed in the direct
seller-to-buyer transaction model often envisioned for Internet commerce. A
market-driven solution to the lemons problem, however, involves relying on an
intermediary who has an incentive to provide truthful information about quality in
the manner buyers can trust. When there are multiple buyers and sellers as
in international cyberspace, there is even less chance of a buyer finding a
seller with a recognizable name. Especially for a one-time purchase of a small
document, searching and learning about all potential sellers would be far too
costly. In a market where neither sellers nor public third parties are adequate
in resolving quality uncertainty, an intermediary-based market clearing
mechanism can achieve an efficiency similar to, or better than, any non-mediated
or regulatory regime, by transmitting product information and successfully
and efficiently mediating a trade.
</P>

<P>This discussion's definition of intermediaries includes various types
of market agents and institutions, besides sellers and buyers, who participate
in market transactions but do not consume the product for themselves. In
a typical commercial transaction, for example, a wide range of intermediaries
is involved&#151;advertising agencies, insurance companies, banks, wholesalers
and retailers, delivery firms, and regulatory agencies. Each of these
intermediaries adds value to the product as well as costs. The primary economic role of
an intermediary is in reducing the total cost of production and delivery
through transactional efficiencies, reviewed in the following section. This role,
however,
</P>
<A NAME="PAGENUM-156"><P>Page 156</P></A>


<P>
is of minor interest because a market will function, albeit less
efficiently, without such efficiency-enhancing intermediaries. On the other hand,
intermediaries perform an essential role without which a market may
fail. Brokering quality information is one such instance, and for that reason,
intermediaries will be as important in electronic commerce as in physical markets.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch04_ 13">
Transactional Efficiencies
</A></H4>

<P>Traditionally, the economic gain attributed to an
intermediary&#151;reduced costs&#151;is largely due to organizational efficiency. Essentially, a firm can
undertake the same task performed by an outside intermediary, but an
intermediary is preferred because it costs less. A manufacturer, for example, could
accept product orders directly from consumers and deliver them. But the firm
often finds it cheaper to sell its product to a wholesaler. The cost-reducing role
of intermediaries has been the subject of transactions economics of Coase
(1937) and Williamson (1975). Transactions
economics distinguishes production costs from other costs incurred to fulfill market transactions such as delivery,
insurance, and other contractual arrangements. The efficiency of
intermediaries depends on whether the total transaction or coordination cost from using
an intermediary is more or less than not using it.
</P>

<P>For a firm or a market to be efficient, production costs as well as
transaction costs must be minimized. For that reason, a market with lower
transaction costs is considered to be more efficient. Some see middlemen as just adding
to the cost of distribution. The cost of selling to consumers in physical
markets&#151;for example, inventorying, billing, and shipping expenses&#151;can sometimes
be lowered by using intermediaries. In many cases, wholesalers and
retailers provide producers with a more efficient distribution channel. Lacking
these intermediaries, many firms would have to duplicate their distribution for
each customer. In figure 4.4, a producer selling directly to multiple buyers
incurs costs of T1 for each transaction.
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-157"><P>Page 157</P></A>


<BR>
<a href="javascript:displayWindow('images/ch04fg04.jpg', 238, 181)"><img src="images/tn_ch04fg04.jpg"></a><BR>
<P>Figure 4.4 Transaction costs comparison with and without an intermediary.
</P>

<P>In physical markets, a firm sells in bulk to an intermediary (costing
T2) who is located close to consumers or has an efficient distribution system.
The intermediary adds T3 as its selling cost to the final price. As a result, in
an intermediated market, the total transaction cost per consumer is T2 plus
T3. This may be lower than T1 because (a) the intermediary is closer to
buyers, minimizing T3 and (b) the producer incurs only one T2 to deliver his
product in bulk so that the per consumer cost is lower due to the economy of scale.
</P>

<P>On the Internet, however, the firm will sell only one copy to the 
intermediary, who makes digital copies and sells them to buyers.
Therefore, wholesaling in bulk has little meaning in digital commerce&#151;except perhaps
in &quot;mirroring&quot; where duplicated materials are kept in several servers&#151;and
with consumers distributed widely throughout the network, the intermediary's
cost of selling to consumers (T3) might be as large as the cost of
producer-to-buyer delivery (T1). In other words, the gain from retailing and distribution is not
so apparent in the non-spatial environment of the Internet.
</P>

<P>This scenario seems to indicate that there is no role for an
intermediary, especially one of distribution, on the Internet. An efficient search
method reduces the need to rely on someone &quot;who knows all producers&quot; in the
market.
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-158"><P>Page 158</P></A>


<P>
Therefore, the rationale for an intermediary in electronic commerce has
little to do with transactional efficiencies. What then is the role of an
intermediary in electronic commerce? An intermediary improves market efficiency
by providing third-party information about product quality, thereby
eliminating the possibility of a market failure due to quality uncertainty. The more
severe the uncertainty about the quality is, the stronger the need for an
efficient intermediary in electronic commerce.
</P>

<P>In resolving the lemons problem, intermediaries may actually increase
the transaction costs. The intermediary, for example, may need to invest in
becoming an expert who can tell the quality of a product requiring technical
knowledge. For experience goods, the intermediary may try out all the products
it sells and gain knowledge. Both the expertise and experience have costs
attached. Despite increased transaction costs, however, the intermediated
market gains efficiency over the lemons market because the market is not
foreclosed&#151;that is, goods are available to consumers. Even an intermediary who has
no expertise in evaluating quality may provide quality assurance simply by
virtue of being a long-term player in the market. Again, the intermediary may add
to the costs of transaction, but it does not need to invest in expertise or
undergo costly testing while acting as an information source to prevent market
failure. The following section discusses the informational roles of an intermediary.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch04_ 14">
Intermediaries as Experts
</A></H4>

<P>As mentioned previously, consumers are unable to discover the quality of
a product if the quality evaluation is complicated and requires special
expertise or if the product is an experience good. A gem stone or an art painting,
for example, requires an expert evaluator to judge its value. Sophisticated
word processing programs are often evaluated by software experts, but still
leave consumers scratching their heads. For an experience good such as
information, its quality can be learned only after viewing (using) the product.
</P>

<P>Neither acquiring an expertise nor using a product is costless. An
art evaluator undergoes years of training and experience to become an
expert. Because an intermediary, by definition, does not derive any utility from
