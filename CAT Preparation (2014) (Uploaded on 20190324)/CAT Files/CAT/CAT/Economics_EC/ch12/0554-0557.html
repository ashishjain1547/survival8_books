<UL>
sometimes called multimedia convergence. When a product exists
in both digital and physical forms, the convergence may make one
form obsolete. Whether a particular physical or digital form survives
will depend on its usefulness in consumption. For example,
computer catalogs in libraries have almost eliminated catalog index files.
The former has undoubted superiority over the latter in terms of
convenience, search capability, and save and print features. The same
convenience factor may favor printed books over digital books,
however, especially for books that should be read from cover to cover. For
reference books, digital versions are decidedly superior in terms of
consumption.
<LI>       Process convergence. One virtual process may be used for
different purposes that used to be carried out by different processes. For
example, a producer may solicit inputs from consumers regarding a feature of
its product. That consumer-revealed information is then used for
production (customization) as well as for marketing, sales, and
negotiations with consumers regarding terms of payment. As a result,
production, marketing, sales, consumption, and customer after-sale service are
all converging into a seamless, integrated process of the virtual
economy. The market-value chain can no longer be divided into stages and
steps, and must not only be continuous but also concurrent. Such
convergence cannot be expected with the broadcast mass media, which is
why electronic commerce is more than an alternative marketing channel.
<LI>       Infrastructure convergence. Various types of communications
infrastructure are converging as well. Infrastructure convergence is
made possible by digitization of products and other technologies that
support the transfer of digital signals. This convergence has made
competitors out of telephone companies, cable operators, and microwave
and satellite operators, which individually used to enjoy a natural
monopoly status. For example, digital telephony on the Internet takes
business from long distance carriers and access charges from local-loop
providers. Satellite systems pose significant competition to Internet carriers
and
</UL>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-555"><P>Page 555</P></A>


<UL>
telephone operators by beaming signals directly to PCs and
telephones, as they did with cable television programming. In these
converging markets, the need for uniform fees and taxes is already highlighted
by the struggle between local exchange carriers and Internet service
providers. Beyond a common tariff structure, the convergence will
demand new approaches in government regulation, competitive
strategies, product development, transaction processes, and economic research
and analysis.<BR>

<LI>      Market space convergence. Finally, globalization implies a
spatial convergence of markets. A classic example of a monopoly is a
geographically isolated firm&#151;for example, the only gas station in
an isolated town. In the virtual economy, there is no monopoly
market power due to geographical isolation unless artificial borders are
erected. Neither will there be the need to have franchise stores all over
the virtual marketplace. One principle of franchising is to guarantee
a monopoly market for each franchiser by not allowing two franchisers
to locate next to each other. With only one market, there is no need
for franchising, although mirroring&#151;the practice of providing
identical materials on different servers to lower the congestion
problem&#151;may eventually be considered to be a form of franchising.
</UL>

<P>Convergence brings about new opportunities as well as uncertainties.
As products are digitized, they acquire new characteristics that increase
their appeal. For example, a CD-ROM version of an encyclopedia provides
search and link capabilities far exceeding the cross-indexing features provided by
book versions. New products mean new uses, new customers, and new ways
of doing business. Many focus on the opportunity to expand their business,
but the novelty also creates uncertainty.
</P>

<P>For example, as the telecommunications infrastructure converges,
traditional boundaries among telephone companies, cable operators, and
satellite operators become unclear. These companies are experimenting in such areas
as video-on-demand services, interactive television, cable modems, online
shopping, and video dial tone to gauge consumer response and future
profitability in their widening playing field. Not knowing consumer demand and
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-556"><P>Page 556</P></A>


<P>
competitors' strategies, however, they are hesitant to plunge into the
unknown. On the other hand, Bill Gates of Microsoft, Craig McCaw (who
founded McCaw Cellular Communications), and other investors are willing to take
a risk in the future of converging infrastructure. Their enterprise is
called Teledesic Corp., which will invest almost $10 billion to place 840 low
earth-orbiting satellites. The plan is to offer broadband connection,
broadcasting, video conferencing, and other telecommunications services worldwide
through Teledesic's satellite network. The project's possible payoffs may be as large
as the size of necessary investments.</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch12_ 6">
Convergence and the Market Structure
</A></H4>

<P>The success of Teledesic and similar projects hinges on convergence not only
in telecommunications but also in networking technologies, computer
interface, digital contents, and worldwide markets. As mentioned earlier, the
Information Superhighway environment enables various products and services to
be produced, distributed, and consumed. An efficient, worldwide
information infrastructure will be useless if its usage is limited to a few activities such
as voice communication or online newspaper delivery. If it entails all types
of virtual activities, however, its economic impact will far surpass that of
the modern telecommunications industry. Convergence is the key factor that
will make or break an investment project that aims at leveraging the future
information infrastructure. If successful, any company that controls the
infrastructure is in a position to be a dominant firm in other areas of the
virtual economy.
</P>

<P>Suppose a firm is a dominant player in computer operating systems
and many application program markets. It may also extend its dominance in
the last mile from the computer to the information infrastructure through
networking software and access services. By constructing the network itself, such
a firm can integrate all aspects of the infrastructure necessary for virtual
processes, establishing itself as a significant player in content provision as well
by cooperating with other content providers. Virtual contents consist of
more than information products and services. Online payment services,
online</P>


<A NAME="PAGENUM-557"><P>Page 557</P></A>


<P>
banking, and digital currency services, for example, are necessary for the
virtual market. A firm that can dominate the world digital currency market can take
a lion's share of the seigniorage. Such a firm must possess the reputation
and capital necessary to convince consumers to hold its currency, just as the
wealth and credibility of the U.S. government is the sole guarantee to those who
hold dollars. The process of vertical integration and monopolization in all
these sectors of the worldwide economy has been unimaginable, but is becoming
a reality driven by the convergence in markets and the relaxation in&#151;or
lack of&#151;regulatory market interventions.
</P>

<P>An alternative scenario is an efficient, competitive economy where
decentralized markets support many players and allocate resources efficiently.
The first step in promoting such an economy is to eliminate inefficient
mechanisms for resource allocation, induce better quality for products and services,
and guarantee a level playing field for all players. For example, as was discussed
in Chapter 3, usage-based pricing in Internet access services will enhance
quality and allocate resources efficiently. In the software market, the
telecommunications economics, as we discussed in Chapter 11, &quot;Business and Policy
Implications of Electronic Commerce,&quot; can enlighten policymakers about
what constitutes anticompetitive behaviors.

<P>Electronic commerce, by its own efficiencies, will also be able to
provide competitive and effective marketplaces for products and services often
monopolized in physical markets. For example, differentiated and
customized products will offer more choices than mass-produced goods, for which a
firm with sufficient economies of scale has the cost advantage.
Microproducts, applets, and microbundles enable short-term contracts between suppliers
and intermediaries and between retailers and consumers. As we discussed in
Chapter 4, &quot;Quality Uncertainty and Market Efficiency,&quot; short-term contracts,
in turn, reduce inefficiencies caused by quality uncertainty. Electronic
payment systems based on micropayments and digital currency will facilitate
selling microproducts in addition to bundling and subscription, for which
existing payment mechanisms are adequate. Micropayments will also support a
usage-based copyright payment system, enabling content sellers to meter and bill
