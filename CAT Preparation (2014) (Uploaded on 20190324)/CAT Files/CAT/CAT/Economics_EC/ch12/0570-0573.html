however, will consist of finely segmented online communities whose
participants include the majority of potential consumers. By becoming an
active member of these online groups, a seller will maintain contact with all
its customers and find out about competitors' strategies as well as
consumer responses.</P>

<P>As producers and sellers learn in a networked market environment,
their product selection and pricing strategies will affect both their customers
and their competitors. For customers, the issues will be the gains in
better-matching products and the potential losses in discriminatory prices. For
competitors, the strategic value of new information will depend on its availability to
competitors. For example, if the data on the Internet is public, it will offer
no competitive advantage, because all competitors will have the same
information. However, if the data is made private, such information is strategically
valuable; therefore, the cost of securing and processing such information will be
weighed against the gains in the market share or the profit. In all likelihood, the
profit potential will justify monitoring and analyzing public messages in some 
fashion.
</P>

<P>Current economic and marketing models do not account for
interactions between producers and consumers. The market somehow functions to
match supply with demand. As the uncertainty about product quality and even
about the identity of transacting partners grows in the virtual marketplace,
however, market agents will no longer be passive. The availability of information
and the technology to gather and process such information is the hallmark of
an electronic market such as the Internet. Economic models, then, will have
to incorporate the active learning by producers and the effects of such action
on product choices, prices, competition, and consumer welfare. Just as
researchers and corporate employees can collaborate and learn from each other on
the Internet, firms and consumers will determine market choices through
interacting and learning from each other. Such interactive learning will be pervasive
in the future virtual economy.

<H4><A NAME="ch12_ 13">
Consumer Customization
</A></H4>

<P>Customization by consumers occurs in two stages. First, products are
customized through a selection process in which consumers eliminate
unwanted portions of a product. Second, products are modified to suit consumer
tastes on receipt. For example, consumers may ask an online news service to
send them news about a specific firm but not about others. Either the news
producer or an intermediary personalizes the product and delivers it. The
second stage of customization is not needed in this case. Alternatively, consumers
may receive the news feed without selecting, but&#151;after receiving all of
it&#151;discard unwanted parts. In terms of bandwidth efficiency, the second type of
delivery is undeniably inferior, but it allows customers more control over the use
of information.
</P>

<P>The selection process by which consumers weed out unwanted products
is called filtering. In the age of information overload, information filtering
offers consumers not only the power to select products but also the means to
automate repeated tasks by training filtering agents to recognize what is
wanted and not wanted. For example, e-mail from unwanted sources can be
filtered out by a software agent that recognizes the user's preference. The same
preference profile can also be used to schedule meetings based on certain
principles, such as no meetings between 9 a.m. and 10 a.m.; project A takes
precedent over all other projects; or meetings should be based on the proximity of
their location. Software agents are either fed such information by the user or
programmed to learn by observing and analyzing the user's actions. The
analysis typically consists of statistical score-keeping; that is, if a user repeats the
same action twice or more, the agent recognizes it as the user's preference
(Maes, 1994).
</P>

<P>A logical extension of filtering agents in the future will be a smart
product with the capability to learn and adapt to each user's preference. Instead
of being endowed with this capability, all products will have an open interface
to</P>


<A NAME="PAGENUM-572"><P>Page 572</P></A>


<P>
interact with any intelligent agent trained by a consumer. Thus, each
consumer in the virtual economy will have an intelligent agent&#151;a virtual alter
ego&#151;to monitor and sort incoming e-mail messages, search for product vendors,
alert the user for new products of interest, interact with smart products to
configure them to match the user's preferences, and so on. When you order an
online article, negotiations will be conducted between your agent and the
seller's. After you buy smart computer software, your agent will customize it for
you. Your car, house security system, hot water boiler, coffeemaker, and
centralized heating system will all be smart and configured and monitored by your
agent, which will alert you and recommend a course of action when something is
out of order. You will be able to display daily temperatures, gas and
electricity consumption, boiler efficiency, and other data on your computer or
HDTV screen, analyze the data, and exchange the information with others.</P>

<P>To accomplish this, smart products will have to be furnished with
the capability to be customized and have an interface for interacting with
smart agents. Such an interoperability requirement will not produce a single
dominant product but will require some standardization for those features that
need interfacing (see the discussion about interoperability in section 11.9). At
a minimum, any smart product should adhere to a communications protocol
in order to communicate or receive instructions through, for example, e-mail.
</P>

<P>With filtering agents and smart products available to consumers,
the debate between push-and-pull models of marketing will become
pointless. Consumers may in fact prefer sellers to push all information to them so
they can choose what is relevant, instead of leaving that decision to the
sellers. When buyers have all the information, a seller's bargaining position
will deteriorate accordingly; thus, sellers will choose what information to send,
but buyers will have control over whether to receive that message. The
effectiveness of the pull model will also be limited by the amount of information sellers
are willing to provide. To market customized products, both sellers and
buyers must communicate in a process of push-and-pull negotiation.

12.8. Globalization and Cybernations
</A></H3>

<P>While the virtual world will no longer have national boundaries,
virtual communities and groups will abound. Instead of political boundaries,
the virtual world will be divided by interests and preferences. In electronic
commerce, globalization will afford sellers access to a larger market with regard
to geographical area, but product differentiation and customization will mean
a smaller market for each product.
</P>

<P>Globalization is aided by the removal of tariffs and other regulatory
measures based on geographical boundaries. The global
telecommunications accord and the information technology agreement pioneered by the
World Trade Organization during the last years of the 20th century have opened up 
a truly international trade in computers, telecommunications equipment,
and software. A uniform commercial code and an income tax policy for 
international trade will further stimulate exchanges in digital products.
Most important, a fully convertible digital currency will facilitate
international transactions. As a result of these developments, a product's market will
be defined not by geographical areas but solely by its customers.
</P>

<P>Globalization, however, will not break down all market boundaries,
as customers still have different tastes. While spatial convergence will
remove geographical market boundaries, virtual communities will act as distinct
and coherent groups, just as physical markets and nations do today.
These cybercommunities or cybernations will be made up of like-minded
consumers and businesses, congregating and interacting online. Sellers will want to
know who participates in such virtual communities and how they interact.
</P>

<P>In the virtual marketplace, consumers will learn about product
quality from each other, while sellers will observe consumers' reactions to their
products and marketing strategies. What will the implications be of such
learning by agents in a market? For one thing, unlike today's emphasis on
strategic interactions between firms, the electronic marketplace will make apparent
