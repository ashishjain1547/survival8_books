<UL>
<LI>     E-mail is seen as the equivalent of modern letter-writing, but it
is basically a file-transfer mechanism, which can handle letters as well
as all types of files. Because of the familiarity and acceptance of
e-mailing among Internet users, consumers will be ready to grasp its future
functions.
<LI>     Permanent e-mail addresses are offered freely, which is based on
the forwarding principle. A future virtual player will have a
permanent Internet identity, much like a social security number. Messages will
be forwarded to current servers based on dynamic updating of
domain name servers or net identity servers.
</UL>

<P>The futuristic aspect in this scenario is in making all these
technologies work in a seamless, interoperable system; therefore, when developing a
component technology, businesses need to have a long-term perspective. For
example, the analog HDTV standard has been abandoned by the Japanese
government and corporations who introduced it early in the 1980s. Analog HDTVs
will not operate with digital HDTVs and are thus unable to participate in
the digital revolution. Going against such a trend will be a disaster. Likewise,
smart products should adopt standard communications protocols so they can
be controlled remotely via the Internet or other prevailing networks.
Proprietary software will isolate the product and diminish its usefulness in the
virtual economy. By visualizing how consumers use their products in the
future, businesses can gain an insight into what features their products must offer
as well.
</P>

<P>The Alice and Bob example is decidedly not one of a market
transaction involving sellers and buyers. Electronic commerce will be conducted in
the same way Alice and Bob made contacts, exchanged their messages, and
went about their everyday lives, but with added technologies and features of
an economic system&#151;payment mechanisms, product specifications,
intermediation, and negotiation processes for trade, contracts, and delivery. The
most significant lesson for product sellers in the above example is the need
for interoperability that enables an integrated and seamless consumption
process.
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-563"><P>Page 563</P></A>


<P>
Future virtual markets invite speculation about what other general features
can be detected to guide us during the next 20 years. The next section will
delve into some market aspects of the future virtual economy.</P>

12.6. Growth of Virtual Intermediaries
</A></H3>

<P>Some people predict that intermediaries with a primary role of
distributing products will no longer be needed in electronic commerce. This
disinter-mediation hypothesis is based on the fact that the Internet offers
instant transactions throughout the globe, with consumers able to contact
producers directly. In fact, it isn't even necessary to go to an Internet shopping mall if
a producer's web address is known. Intermediary services, however, include
not only distributional services such as wholesale and retailing but also
insurance, marketing, financial services, and other functions producers may prefer
to delegate to intermediaries. As a result, the virtual economy will be
populated by cybermediaries to provide such essential services as certification,
payment services, quality assurance, copyright clearing, and royalty allocation, as well
as distribution.
</P>

<P>The necessity to support commercial transactions in the electronic
marketplace has generated various types of new services and intermediaries,
including cyberbanks, certification services, digital currency servers, electronic malls,
and search services. Future virtual intermediaries, however, will do more
than support transactions&#151;they will also facilitate various market and
non-market processes, such as the following examples:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>        Education brokers: Schools and educational institutions
perform intermediary functions as they organize the transfer of knowledge
and skills by mediating transactions between teachers and students.
Whether education is viewed as a collaborative or a transactional activity,
the advent of flexible, distributed communications media and
digital educational materials will demand a wholesale rethinking of
how students learn or are trained for job skills. The new virtual
educational
</UL>


<A NAME="PAGENUM-564"><P>Page 564</P></A>


<UL>
service is not an electronic version of conventional classrooms or
distance learning, but a customized, on-demand learning model that
takes advantage of real-time interactions, flexible curricula, and
immense amounts of materials provided by schools, teachers, authors, and so
on. (H&auml;m&auml;l&auml;inen, Whinston and Vishik, 1996). While the tradition
of liberal education will persist along with the unreplaceable value of
a school or college, skills training and technical education will be
better served by virtual education brokers.<BR>

<LI>       Market organizers: A virtual education broker is, in a sense, an
organizer of a market for teachers, course material suppliers,
students, performance or skill certifiers, and business clients who want
their employees trained. Similarly, all types of markets will be organized
and carried out by virtual intermediaries. Although
stock-and-commodity trading floors will be preserved to remind us how physical markets
in the previous century facilitated exchanges of these goods, electricity
and gas will be purchased and delivered in the virtual market, movies
and television programs will be auctioned off and delivered to
individual homes, and political meetings will be held online, where
political parties, influence peddlers, and interest groups will vie for
attention. Intermediaries are those who organize markets or meeting places
for existing products and services, but utilize virtual processes.
<LI>       Personalized service
providers: Computers have already replaced personal secretaries who typed and edited your letters, organized
appointments, and so on. Similarly, virtual entrepreneurs will be
your personal shoppers, accountants, travel agents, investment
bankers&#151;all those personal assistants that only a millionaire can now afford.
The enabling technologies are available today. Intelligent software agents
can navigate virtual space, collecting and processing information,
and desktop personal assistants that can learn about your tastes and act
on your behalf are becoming more sophisticated. Although these
technologies will make it possible to automate many tasks, specialists will
continue to have better knowledge and expertise to complete some
tasks,
</UL>


<A NAME="PAGENUM-565"><P>Page 565</P></A>



<UL>
 no matter how much information is fed into a software agent.
Using these technologies, personalized service providers will maintain
real-time contact with their customers, executing searches, orders,
and negotiations based on personal preference profiles.
</UL>





<P>Education brokers and personalized service providers will not only
offer old products in new bottles but will also change the way their services are
sold in the marketplace. For example, instead of going through four years of
college under a rigid curriculum, students will choose courses on the basis of
which are needed&#151;and when&#151;for developing the critical skills employers demand
or finishing an important research project. Individual professors will offer
courses through education brokers, and a course's popularity will be determined by
its usefulness. As a result, the virtual education market will consist of
numerous fragmented course providers instead of a few colleges, customized and
up-to-date products instead of set curricula, and short-term but continuous
transactions, such as just-in-time learning instead of long-term (usually
four-year), one-time transactions. The market process is need-based and decentralized.
At the same time, products and services are fragmented, personalized, and
flexible enough to be configured for a single sale or multiple sessions.
</P>

<P>The market for information and knowledge, just as the education
market, exhibits fragmentation and decentralization in products, content
providers, and consumer uses. The beginning of such a decentralized market is seen
in the World Wide Web, but many observers consider the proliferation of
web pages in today's Internet to be only transitory and contend that they
will ultimately find no market. Instead, electronic commerce awaits the entry
of those who control valuable content, such as publishers, movie studios,
and record companies.
</P>

<P>What then is the role of publishers and movie studios? They are
intermediaries who collect, process, and market products made by individual
authors and directors. Newspaper publishers are information intermediaries
who employ authors and reporters and deliver assorted stories in a printed
medium. In the future virtual economy, columnists will sell their wares through a
web site. Reporters will provide real-time accounts of an event on the Internet
as</P>
