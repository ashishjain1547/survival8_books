firms selected. A simple price schedule may be linear based on a fixed
amount for each company selected, for example $0.25 per company. A more
complex pricing strategy involves quantity discount or discounts based on tiers.
Such relationships between product differentiation and pricing are discussed in
more detail in section 8.4.

Gains and Losses from Customization
</A></H4>

<P>The primary economic benefits of product customization stem from the
fact that products match consumers' needs better than undifferentiated
products which correspond to the taste of the average consumer. For sellers,
better product matching means a reduced opportunity for consumer arbitrage.
For consumers and society, customized products reduce wastes but may
cause higher prices.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch08_ 14">
Consumer Arbitrage
</A></H4>

<P>By customizing their products, digital product sellers can discourage
consumers from unauthorized reproduction and distribution. In the example
of customized news services, the product delivered to one person may not
be valuable to another if they are interested in different sets of companies.
Because digital products are prone to copyright violations by users,
personalized
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-329"><P>Page 329</P></A>


<P>
products have an obvious advantage if unauthorized
distribution (consumer arbitrage) is limited. Limiting consumer arbitrage is the most
important requirement for successful discriminatory pricing. For example, if a seller
tries to charge different prices to different buyers in a situation where buyers
are able to exchange products, buyers who pay the lowest price will try to resell
to others. Therefore, the seller is not able to charge any price higher than
the lowest price.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch08_ 15">
Reduced Waste
</A></H4>

<P>Industrial goods manufactured with mass production technologies have
made many convenience goods more affordable to more consumers than ever
before, but these products are often made for the average or representative
consumer. For physical products such as toothbrushes, one or a few differentiated
models may suffice to satisfy the needs of the majority of consumers. Digital
products, however, are more individualized. For example, people read a newspaper
for various reasons&#151;today's headline news, sports scores, weather, want
ads, entertainment, and so on. To accommodate these needs, a newspaper carries
all types of information, but many sections are never read. However, a
digital newspaper does not need to be constrained by printing technologies that
have shaped the way newspapers are produced and distributed in the
physical world. Instead of simply producing an electronic edition of a
newspaper consisting of the same material as the paper version, a digital newspaper can
be customized to deliver only the information needed by readers, who are
no longer faced with the disposing of unwanted portions of the newspaper.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch08_ 16">
Price Discrimination
</A></H4>

<P>Reduced personal arbitrage also supports discriminatory prices, which
means that sellers can charge the maximum amount that consumers are willing
to pay. With no possibility to arbitrage, the price can be monopolistically
determined.
</P>

<P>The most important aspect of discriminatory pricing is that prices
are based on user valuation, not on production costs. In a competitive
market where sellers do not have market power, prices tend to equal marginal
costs
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-330"><P>Page 330</P></A>


<P>
regardless of the level of user valuation. Consumers retain any surplus, which
is the difference between what they are prepared to pay&#151;the so-called
reservation prices&#151;and the prevailing market price. In non-competitive
markets, prices tend to approach the monopoly level at which consumers are made
to pay the highest price. When consumers differ in their valuation, firms
with market power try to individualize prices to further discriminate customers
by using such measures as multi-part tariffs. Customization is an extreme
example of the individualization of products and prices.
</P>
<P>In electronic commerce, a pricing strategy based on user valuation is
more prominent because of product customization. Due to the product's
reproducibility, the marginal production cost of digital products is negligible, so
marginal prices have little significance in determining efficient prices.
When copyright payments are considered as variable costs of production,
competitive prices may amount to these payments. More likely, an efficient and
competitive electronic market may have prices based on average costs of
production where each firm is at its break-even level of production. A detailed
examination of costs and prices is postponed until the last section of this chapter, but
it is emphasized here that the standard economic argument that the market
price is equated with the marginal cost (price = marginal revenue = marginal
cost) has little relevancy in the digital marketplace. Copyright payments, as
variable costs, also may not be uniform but variable for every instance of sale,
moving further from today's practice that distinguishes payments according to
major sales channels. Rather, the transmutability of
digital products together with readily accessible consumer information in electronic transactions help
authors or firms to focus on discriminatory pricing. Under this type of market
condition, consumers are forced to choose between buying products that
match their tastes and paying their reservation prices, the highest level of prices.
To determine which choice results in greater consumer welfare requires a
full specification about the value of having products that match consumer
tastes. But generally, discriminatory pricing may involve a transfer of income
from buyers to sellers. In a case when previously unserved consumers buy
products because new brands are offered, the market becomes more efficient
with product differentiation.
</P>

<H3><A NAME="ch08_ 17">
8.3. Use of Consumer Information
</A></H3>

<P>The ability to effectively customize a product depends on the
producer's knowledge of what a buyer wants. If consumer tastes vary greatly&#151;as is
evident for knowledge-based products&#151;products tend to be more
differentiated, but if tastes are similar, firms are required to produce fairly similar products.
A wide distribution of taste means that consumers are scattered throughout
the product's characteristics space; if consumers' preferences are alike, they
are bunched in a smaller area. Therefore, it is important to know where
consumers are located. Market surveys are one way to gain such information, but
surveys only measure relative shapes of the distribution. In contrast, consumer
information collected on the Internet not only reveals the shape of the
preference distribution but also identifies which consumers want certain products.
This section examines what type of consumer information is collected and how it
is currently used in electronic commerce. Future methods of information
collection are discussed in Chapter 12 (see section 12.5, &quot;The Virtual Economy
in Action&quot;). Depending on how the information is used or traded among
sellers, it may be used to erect entry barriers and reduce competition in digital
product markets.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch08_ 18">
Primary and Secondary Consumer Information
</A></H4>

<P>Identifiable consumer information was an integral part of marketing
strategy even before the advent of electronic commerce. To obtain a customized
product, a prospective buyer needs to reveal its preferences to the seller.
Buyers today are required to fill out personal information in most economic
transactions or use non-cash payment methods that leave a trail of information. As
a result, when a consumer visits a gas station to change oil for his car, he will
not only get a reminder for another oil change in a few months but will
also receive advertisements from tire stores, automotive supply stores, and so on.
In turn, this personal information is often sold to a third party, who dissects
and analyzes the information by cross referencing and matching it with other data.
