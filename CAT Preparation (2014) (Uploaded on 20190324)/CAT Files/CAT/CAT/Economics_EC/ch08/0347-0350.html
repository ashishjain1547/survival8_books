<P>capacity, misjudgment of consumer tastes, an so on. An informed firm
can increase its profit by reducing this waste as well as by finding markets
that uninformed firms may not serve. More precise demand information
and production creates increased satisfaction for consumers, who are no
longer uncertain about the quantity and product specification.
</P>

<P>In fact, Ponssard (1979) has demonstrated that consumer welfare
increases when firms have better information on market demand. However, his
model also shows that the increase in profit and the value of the information
diminishes as more firms acquire this information. Ponssard refers to
information about the market in general, not about individual preferences. As long as
the better information is about the market but not about identifiable
information, resolving market and demand uncertainties does not pose a direct threat
to consumer welfare. For example, better economic planning can benefit
all sectors of society and, even when consumer information is used to
customize products, consumers do not suffer losses if the new products are sold to
indistinguishable customers. It's only when consumer information is linked
to payment and thereby to discriminatory pricing that we are presented
with both the gain in total welfare through efficiency and the loss in
consumer surplus due to higher prices. In electronic commerce, both the availability
of identifiable consumer information and the use of product
differentiation greatly facilitates discriminatory prices, alternatively known as
differential, nonlinear, or non-uniform prices.

8.4. Pricing Digital Products
</A></H3>

<P>Basic economic research shows that in a competitive market prices are
determined by the level of demand and the cost of supply, or production. In
other words, the market-determined price is efficient in terms of production
and consumption, and the firm operates efficiently at the lowest average cost,
while no consumers who are willing to consume the product are denied.
However, digital products fall into a gray area where such standard economic
reasoning
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-348"><P>Page 348</P></A>


<P>
fails to give an insightful answer to business professionals looking to know
how to price their products. The foremost difficulty stems from the cost
structure of digital products, which is unlike that of most physical products.
Furthermore, most digital products are customized and consist of numerous
component products. As a result, neither the seller nor the market can be expected
to operate with one price for all differentiated products and for all
consumers. Rather, pricing strategies become as complex as the products themselves
and their applications. This section reviews the economic factors that
influence digital product pricing and examines various strategies of
multi-product nonlinear pricing, which operates under atypical market conditions.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch08_ 25">
Cost Curves
</A></H4>

<P>Introductory economics and management classes teach that the total cost
of production consists of fixed cost and variable costs. The fixed cost is the
initial investment needed to produce the first unit, such as the factory, machines,
and research and development. Once production begins, the fixed cost does
not vary whether the firm produces one unit or one thousand units, and thus it
is also known as &quot;sunk cost.&quot; The variable cost, on the other hand, is the sum
of the material and labor costs that are needed to produce each unit.
Consequently, the variable cost of producing ten units may be ten times the cost
of producing one unit.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch08_ 26">
Standard U-Shaped Average Cost Curve
</A></H4>

<P>Figure 8.9 shows typical shapes of fixed and variable
costs. Graphs A and C are total fixed and total variable costs shown in terms of the number of the
output (Q). In this case, the total fixed cost is constant over a range of output
because it is &quot;sunk&quot; at the beginning and does not increase as the output is raised.
The total variable cost increases proportionately to the number of output, but
later increases at a faster rate due to congestion, which is one example of
disecon-omies of scale. As more employees are put to work to increase the
output beyond an optimal level of operation, the per-unit variable cost increases
faster and productivity decreases. The total cost of production&#151;the sum of
total
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-349"><P>Page 349</P></A>


<P>fixed and total variable costs&#151;understandably increases as output is
increased. However, the per-unit cost of production, or the average cost, behaves
quite differently. For example, the average cost may decline until the maximum
level of operation and increase afterward. The decreasing average cost is first due
to wider sharing of the fixed costs. Graph B in figure 8.9 shows the average
fixed cost, which declines as an increasing number of units of output &quot;share&quot;
the initial cost. Graph D is the average variable cost that is constant up to a
level and then increases. The sum of B and D is the aveage (total) costs of
production shown in graph E. Because of the declining average fixed cost, the
average cost first declines but increases later when the effect of the increasing
average variable cost takes effect. The result is a well-known U-shaped average
cost curve. In terms of per-unit production cost, a production process with a
U-shaped average cost curve achieves an efficient level of production when
the average cost is at its lowest.

Average Cost Curve of a Digital Product
</A></H4>

<P>In stark contrast with the standard example above, the bulk of the
production cost of a digital product consists of fixed cost. Once the first unit is
produced, the additional variable costs are negligible regardless of the output level.
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-350"><P>Page 350</P></A>


<P>Although some assume that the variable reproduction cost will be zero,
the author believes that it will be a substantial, albeit constant, amount due to
the per-copy copyright payment. Regardless of the assumption on variable
costs, the declining average fixed cost coupled with zero or constant variable
costs implies that the (total) average cost of a digital product will be similar to graph B in figure 8.9.
</P>

<P>Other industry comparisons may be helpful in determining the
economic implications of a declining average cost (AC). Declining average cost is
common in the utility and communications industries due to the extreme size
of the initial investment in infrastructure. As the per-unit cost of one firm
declines, it makes little sense to allow a competitor, which would result in
two firms operating at non-optimal levels of production. In these often
highly regulated industries, one firm will be more efficient in exhausting the
economies of scale manifested in the declining AC. However, the one firm, as
a monopolist, may engage in inefficient market behavior such as
heightened prices and output restriction. There is a large body of economic literature
that studies pricing practices under declining average costs, especially on how
to apply marginal cost pricing to guarantee that a natural monopolist
breaks even and still maximize social welfare (see the &quot;Suggested Readings and
Notes&quot; list at the end of this chapter).
</P>

<P>The fundamental difference between a monopolist, or
firms with some market power, and a competitive firm is that a monopolist can raise prices
and increase profits without suffering a complete loss of customers. In a
competitive market, a firm loses all its customers if it raises prices above the
prevailing market level. Graphically, the difference is whether the firm's market demand
is flat or declining: a firm with market power faces a declining demand
schedule while a competitive firm faces a flat demand curve. However, no
competitive firm will survive if they have declining AC curves. In figure 8.10, graph
A shows a firm in a competitive market where only one price (p) prevails
initially for some reason. But competition implies that a competitor will try to
undercut its price, which will become zero after a round of price cuts. At a price
of zero, no firm will survive. For digital products such as databases, many
competitors would not survive if they sell similar products.
