argue in favor of a new mechanism to protect software (Samuelson et
al., 1994). The industry practices attempt to sidestep the whole issue of
copyright versus patent protection for software by heavily using licensing
agreements rather than sales to distribute the product. Through licensing, software
vendors maintain the ownership of the product and can impose various
restrictions regarding the use of their products. A proper legal protection for
software would represent a legitimate instance to rethink copyright laws for
electronic commerce.
</P>

<H3><A NAME="ch05_ 22">
5.5. Policy Implications
</A></H3>

<P>The concern over protecting authors' rights in the digital marketplace has
not escaped the attention of the relevant policymakers. The legislation on
copyright considered by the Congress during its 1996 session (S. 1284; H.R.
2441) would have made any electronic copy of copyrighted material an
infringement and also would have restricted the applicability of the fair use rule in the
case of digital products. These bills reflect the position of software makers,
publishers, and entertainment companies, represented by the
Creative Incentive Coalition <a href="http://www.cic.org">
(http://www.cic.org)</A>, that favors extending copyright protection
to electronic commerce. The general direction of the bill mirrors the
recommendations (known as the Lehman paper; see
<a href="http://www.uspto.gov/web/ipnii">
http://www.uspto.gov/web/ipnii)</A> made by the Working Group on Intellectual Property Rights of the
Information Infrastructure Task Force, which has been widely criticized for taking
the content owners' position.
</P>

<P>Both the Working Group and the Creative Incentive Coalition
maintain that content owners will not be willing to provide quality information
products on the Internet unless suitable property rights are secured.
Without content, the Information Superhighway will be a long, winding, and above
all, empty road. And the presumed benefits from commercial use of the
Information Superhighway may not ever materialize. Unlike previous copyright
legislation, this will be the first time that the law is proactive, instead of reactive
to
</P>
<A NAME="PAGENUM-205"><P>Page 205</P></A>


<P>
the current threats to publishers' market control. The publishers' position
is that an extended copyright protection is a prerequisite for their
participation in the new electronic marketplace. The question to ask is whether
digital markets are sufficiently different from other markets to warrant
exceptional copyright protection.
</P>
<P>This is not supported with enough evidence. On the contrary, the
aspects of the digital market currently perceived as shortcomings are the very
advantages it affords to the sellers. Customization and price discrimination
possibilities as well as the acquisition of consumer behavioral data actually shift
the balance in favor of the sellers in electronic commerce. Furthermore, the
nature of digital products provide many incentives for the sellers to innovate
and improve product and service selection and quality. As under any
regulatory regime, overprotection of a market can result in stagnation of economic
activity to the detriment of both the consumer and society.
</P>

<P>Serious specific objections have been raised against the current
proposal. Among them are the following:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>           Making a new category of author's right for browsing and digital
transmission
<LI>           Abolishing the first sale rule
<LI>           Limiting the scope of fair use
</UL>

<P>In each of these points, the current legislative effort seems to favor
expanding publishers' rights. Debates on whether such radical changes are
warranted for the digital marketplace will continue although the discussion in this
chapter indicates that market-oriented solutions may well work with a
minimal change in existing copyright laws.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch05_ 23">
Copyright and Antitrust Concerns
</A></H4>

<P>When a product has a network externality, the value of the product is
increased as more people use the same product. (See Chapter 3, &quot;Internet
Infrastructure and Pricing,&quot; for a detailed discussion on the network externality.) As there
are more users, more products compatible and useful to the user will be offered.
In
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-206"><P>Page 206</P></A>


<P>
many instances, the product becomes the standard to which all other
products must be compatible. A primary example is the computer operating system,
for which market Microsoft's Windows and related products dominate.
More computer programs are developed for Windows operating systems
than Macintosh or Unix operating systems because there are more users in
the Windows market.
</P>
<P>When a product becomes a de facto standard and is protected by
copyright, its producer indeed enjoys a monopoly market power. In many
cases, such a monopoly is encouraged to minimize duplicative costs of having
competing standards. That monopoly, however, is often regulated in exchange
for its monopoly power. In today's Internet environment, where regulation
is rejected from all sides, a dominant firm will have an unrestricted market
power after its product becomes the standard. Copyrights for its product in
turn protect its monopoly position unless other firms are allowed to license it.
</P>

<P>Some products such as the Internet communications protocol have
been developed as an industry standard which is not copyrighted. But, because
of the network externality, many privately developed computer-related
products exhibit the tendency to become a dominant, standard product in each
market. An antitrust remedy for such a market needs to consider the role played
by copyrights. To deny copyrights will certainly involve the loss of
development costs and other opportunity costs for the firm. Alternatively, governments
may require a kind of compulsory licensing to competitors or developers of
related products. A real antitrust concern arises, however, when the dominant
firm uses its position to strengthen its market power in other markets.
</P>

<P>Antitrust remedies are notoriously slow and inadequate. In the context
of network externalities, even traditional antitrust laws may prove to be
ineffective (Lemley, 1996b). Section 2 of the Sherman Act, for example, prohibits
any firm's monopolization through anticompetitive means. The problem,
however, is to show the evidence for anticompetitive conduct when the nature of
products are such that monopolization occurs seemingly as a normal course
of product development, and the basis of its market power is the
copyright. Similarly, Section 1 of the Sherman Act prohibits conspiratorial
activities
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-207"><P>Page 207</P></A>


<P>
among competitors, which may have substantial adverse effect on
competition. To apply the rule aggressively would mean to prevent any
standard-setting initiative on the part of the firms when standardization would benefit
consumers and society as a whole. On the other hand, to promote
industry-wide standardization often means eliminating copyrights. Indeed, some
standard-setting organizations require their members to denounce any copyright
claim as a condition of participation.
</P>
<P>Of course, being a dominant firm has its own disadvantages. A
market leader can be leapfrogged, for example, by a new firm with an
innovative product that becomes a new standard. The leader finds it difficult to
abandon its product because of its sunk costs, or it may suffer from its own
success because its product becomes unwieldy. Despite these down sides,
however, monopolistic firms whose products are protected by copyrights seem to pose
a significant threat to competition in electronic commerce.
</P>

<H3><A NAME="ch05_ 24">
5.6. Summary
</A></H3>

<P>Copyright in the Digital Age has become one of the hottest issues affecting
the future of electronic commerce. In the first place, the majority of digital
products fall into the range of expressions protected by copyright law. An
estimate by a computer software organization, although it has an obvious bias, puts 
the cost of piracy on and off the Internet at several billion dollars a year.
An international effort to strengthen existing copyright laws was undertaken
in December, 1996 in Geneva for the first time in 25 years, organized by
the World Intellectual Property Organization, a United Nations agency in
charge of the Berne Convention. On the other hand, the culture of the Internet as 
a free and unregulated communications medium has produced a
strong counter-argument for increased public access to information.
Consumer groups and a coalition of the free information movement warn that the
new copyright laws could retard the growth of the Internet and jeopardize the
very future of electronic commerce they intend to protect.
