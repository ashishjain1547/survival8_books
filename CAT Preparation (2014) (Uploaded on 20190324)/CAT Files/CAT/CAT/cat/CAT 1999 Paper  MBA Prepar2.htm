                        instructions:<BR><BR>Choose 1 if the question can be 
                        answered by using one of the statements alone, but 
                        cannot be answered using the other statement 
                        alone.<BR>Choose 2 if the question can be answered by 
                        using either statement alone.<BR>Choose 3 if the 
                        question can be answered by using both statements 
                        together, but cannot be answered using either statement 
                        alone.<BR>Choose 4 if the question cannot be answered 
                        even by using both statements 
                        together.<BR><BR><B>156.</B> The average weight of 
                        students in a class is 50 kg. What is the number of 
                        students in the class?<BR><BR>A. The heaviest and the 
                        lightest members of the class weigh 60 kg and 40 kg 
                        respectively.<BR>B. Exclusion of the heaviest and the 
                        lightest members from the class does not change the 
                        average weight of the students.<BR><BR><B>157.</B> A 
                        small storage tank is spherical in shape. What is the 
                        storage volume of the tank?<BR><BR>A. The wall thickness 
                        of the tank is I cm.<BR>B. When the empty spherical tank 
                        is immersed in a large tank filled with water, 20 litres 
                        of water overflow from the large 
                        tank.<BR><BR><B>158.</B> Mr. X starts walking northwards 
                        along the boundary of a field, from point A on the 
                        boundary, and after walking for 150 metres reaches B, 
                        and then walks westwards, again along the boundary, for 
                        another 100 metres when he reaches C. What is the 
                        maximum distance between any pair of points on the 
                        boundary of the field?<BR><BR>A. The field is 
                        rectangular in shape.<BR>B. The field is a polygon, with 
                        C as one of its vertices and A the mid point of a 
                        side.<BR><BR><B>159.</B> A line graph on a graph sheet 
                        shows the revenue for each year from 1990 through 1998 
                        by points and joins the successive points by straight 
                        line segments. The point for revenue of 1990 is labelled 
                        A, that for 1991 as B, and that for 1992 as C. What is 
                        the ratio of growth in revenue between 91-92 and 
                        90-91?<BR><BR>A. The angle between AB and X-axis when 
                        measured with a protractor is 40 degrees, and the angle 
                        between CB and X-axis is 80 degrees.<BR>B. The scale of 
                        Y-axis is 1 cm = 1000 Rs.<BR><BR><B>160.</B> There is a 
                        circle with centre C at the origin and radius r cm. Two 
                        tangents are drawn from an external point D at a 
                        distance d cm from the centre. What are the angles 
                        between each tangent and the X-axis?<BR><BR>A. The 
                        coordinates of D are given<BR>B. The X-axis bisects one

                        Three professors A, B and C are separately given three 
                        sets of numbers to add. They were expected to find the 
                        answers to 1+1, 1+1+2, and 1+1 respectively. Their 
                        respective answers were 3, 3, and 2. How many of the 
                        professors are mathematicians?<BR><BR>A. A mathematician 
                        can never add two numbers correctly, but can always add 
                        three numbers correctly.<BR>B. When a mathematician 
                        makes a mistake in a sum, the error is + I or 
                        -1.<BR><BR><B>163.</B> How many among the four students

                        exam.<BR>B. The following is a false statement: At least 
                        one among C and D has passed the

                        flowering plants from black seeds and white seeds, each 
                        seed giving rise to one plant. A plant gives flowers of 
                        only one colour. From a black seed comes a plant giving 
                        red or blue flowers. From a white seed comes a plant 
                        giving red or white flowers. How many black seeds were 
                        used by Mr. Mendel?<BR><BR>A. The number of plants with 
                        white flowers was 10.<BR>B. The number of plants with
