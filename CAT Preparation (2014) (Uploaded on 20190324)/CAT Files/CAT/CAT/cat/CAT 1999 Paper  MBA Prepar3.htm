                        </B>These questions are based on the situation given 
                        below:<BR><BR>Recently, Ghosh Babu spent his winter 
                        vacation on Kyakya Island. During the vacation, he 
                        visited the local casino where he came across a new card 
                        game. Two players, using a normal deck of 52 playing 
                        cards, play this game. One player is called the Dealer 
                        and the other is called the Player. First, the Player 
                        picks a card at random from the deck. This is called the 
                        base card. The amount in rupees equal to the face value 
                        of the base card is called the base amount. The face 
                        values of Ace, King, Queen and Jack are ten. For other 
                        cards, the face value is the number on the card. Once, 
                        the Player picks a card from the deck, the Dealer pays 
                        him the base amount. Then the dealer picks a card from 
                        the deck and this card is called the top card. If the 
                        top card is of the same suit as the base card, the 
                        Player pays twice the base amount to the Dealer. If the 
                        top card is of the same colour as the base card (but not 
                        the same suit) then the Player pays the base amount to 
                        the Dealer. If the top card happens to be of a different 
                        colour than the base card, the Dealer pays the base 
                        amount to the Player. <BR><BR>Ghosh Babu played the game 
                        4 times. First time he picked eight of clubs and the 
                        Dealer picked queen of clubs. Second time, he picked ten 
                        of hearts and the dealer picked two of spades. Next 
                        time, Ghosh Babu picked six of diamonds and the dealer 
                        picked ace of hearts. Lastly, he picked eight of spades 
                        and the dealer picked jack of spades. Answer the 
                        following questions based on these four 
                        games.<BR><BR><B>108.</B> If Ghosh Babu stopped playing 
                        the game when his gain would be maximized, the gain in 
                        Rs. would have been<BR><BR>1. 12<BR>2. 20<BR>3. 16<BR>4. 
                        4<BR><BR><B>109.</B> The initial money Ghosh Babu had 
                        (before the beginning of the game sessions) was Rs. X. 
                        At no point did he have to borrow any money. What is the 
                        minimum possible value of X?<BR><BR>1. 16<BR>2. 8<BR>3. 
                        100<BR>4. 24<BR><BR><B>110.</B> If the final amount of 
                        money that Ghosh Babu had with him was Rs. 100, what was 
                        the initial amount he had with him?<BR><BR>1. 120<BR>2. 
                        8<BR>3. 4<BR>4. 96<BR><BR></P>
