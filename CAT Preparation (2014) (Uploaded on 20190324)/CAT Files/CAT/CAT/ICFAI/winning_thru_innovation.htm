        can provide competitive advantage, but it can also create obstacles to

        understand the need to manage effectively the short-term demands for

        the organization with strategy</b></font></p>
        <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Alignment,
        or congruence, between strategy and four organizational building blocks
        – critical tasks and work flows, formal organizational arrangements,
        people, and culture – drives today’s success.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Incongruence, a lack of alignment, or inconsistencies among these
        elements is almost always at the root of today’s performance gaps.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Unless
        managers and their teams clearly understand the roots of today’s
        performance gaps or those barriers to achieving strategic opportunities,
        their attempts to solve these problems or realize the opportunities, are
        likely to be incomplete or may cause other unanticipated problems.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Once
        the critical tasks and work processes for implementing the strategy have
        been defined, the alignment or congruence of the three other major
        organizational building blocks (formal organization structure and
        systems, people, and the culture or informal organization) can be
        examined to ensure that these elements are supporting the attainment of
        the critical tasks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The key
        diagnostic questions for assessing congruence are: Given the critical
        tasks and work flows that must be accomplished, how aligned or congruent
        are the current formal organizational arrangements, culture and people?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Do these organizational building blocks fit with task
        requirements? Do they fit with each other?</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Once
        core inconsistencies are identified, managers can then take targeted
        action to bring the system back into alignment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The greater the number of inconsistencies among the
        organizational building blocks, the more substantial the interventions
        must be.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For instance, a
        change in only one or two components, such as a new reward system or a
        shift in culture to reflect a new competitive demand, can usually be
        managed in incremental fashion. Systemwide lack of congruence, requiring
        changes in three or more of the organizational building blocks, demands
        discontinuous organizational change.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Since
        any action is likely to be incomplete, it is improbable that all
        performance gaps will be reduced. The diagnosis and actions will
        typically reveal other problems. But managers and their teams can learn
        from these situations and reinitiate the process.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The idea is to continually refine and readjust the internal
        congruence of the unit, not to determine the optimal solution for all
        problems.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Successful
        problem solving is a function of both what managers do and how they do.
        Effective managers do the right thing and do it well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Knowing what to do must be backed by effective implementation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Great ideas executed poorly are as bad as poor ideas executed
        flawlessly.</font></p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The
        reason an organization exists is to accomplish the tasks necessary to
        achieve its strategic goals and vision.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Organizational diagnosis must begin by systematically describing
        the critical tasks, always posing the question: Do these tasks and task
        processes help achieve our strategic goals?</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">To
        ensure that people are aligned with critical tasks and work processes,
        managers must assess four aspects of the companies’ human resources:
        competencies (What are they good or bad at?), motives (What rewards are
        most effective in motivating them?), demographics (How long have people
        worked together?), and country differences (What is the cultural mix?).</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Then
        comes an examination of the congruence between critical tasks and the
        formal organization.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
        formal arrangements include the stated structures, roles, procedures,
        measures, and systems that managers use to direct, control, and motivate
        individuals and groups to perform the unit’s critical tasks.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">While
        organizational arrangements reflect decisions about formal structure,
        rewards, and roles, the informal organization reflects emergent
        structures, rewards, and roles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Informal
        patterns of interaction drive a firm’s informal structure, power, and
        communication networks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Emergent
        norms and values define the organization’s culture and act as a social
        control system.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>While
        culture can facilitate innovation, it can also get in the way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Unless managers are sensitive to the effects of social control
        and actively shape informal patterns of interaction, culture may hinder
        innovation and change.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">An
        organization or group’s culture is defined by its values and norms.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Values reflect beliefs about what is really important.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </span>Norms are the widely shared and strongly held social expectations
        about appropriate attitudes and behavior such that compliance with the
        norm is seen as right and appropriate and noncompliance is punished.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Norms and values are the foundations of organizational culture
        that can help or hinder the execution of a unit’s strategy.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The
        formal and informal organization can be viewed graphically. The vertical
        axis, defined by critical tasks and work flows and the formal
        organization, represents the formal control system, the organization’s
        hardware.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The horizontal
        axis, consisting of people and culture, represents the social control
        system, the organization’s software.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Almost all managers learn to use the formal control axis
        effectively. Most managers are, however, far less comfortable and adept
        at using the social control system, perceiving issues of psychology and
        culture as less precise and harder to manage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Yet, it is the social control system that often holds the key to
        the effective management of innovation and change.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">With
        work requirements becoming more complex, uncertain, and changing,
        control systems cannot be static and formal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Rather, control must come in the form of social control systems
        that allow directed autonomy and rely on the judgment of employees
        informed by clarity about the vision and objectives of the business.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Culture
        serves as a social control system.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>In order to diagnose and manage culture, we need to appreciate
        that norms vary in two important ways.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>First, they can vary in the extent of their consensus, or in how
        widely shared they are.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Before a social control system can operate, there needs to be
        shared agreement that certain values, attitudes, and behaviors are
        important.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Simple
        consensus, however, is not sufficient.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>With enough publicity, espoused values like quality or customer
        service may become widely known, but not necessarily practiced.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Therefore, in order to have a strong culture, the norm must also
        be characterized by intensity. People who share the norm must feel so
        strongly enough about it that they are willing to tell others when the
        norm is violated.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">From
        a managerial perspective, the relevant question is whether the
        organization’s social control system supports or hinders managers in
        accomplishing their critical tasks.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000080"><b>Managing
        organizational culture</b></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Because
        innovation involves unpredictability, risk taking, and nonstandard
        solutions – factors not easily managed by formal control systems, the
        effective management of culture lies at the heart of organizational
        innovation.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Innovation
        is reflected in norms that promote the two component processes of
        creativity and implementation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Groups
        that have comparatively strong norms for both are rated as the most
        innovative.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Simply
        promoting creativity or focusing on speed to implement it does not
        guarantee innovation. Both are needed.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Two
        main ingredients stimulate creativity: support for risk taking and
        change and tolerance of mistakes.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Aligning
        culture sometimes involves modifying the formal reward system.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>More often, however, it requires that managers simple use
        foresight and imagination to provide small rewards and informal
        recognition for creative attempt. Another important means for
        encouraging support for creativity and risk taking is to promote a
        positive attitude toward change.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The
        second set of norms that are critical in enhancing innovation are those
        that are actionable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Once
        creative ideas and approaches are identified, will they be enacted?
        There are two important types of norms that ensure action: those that
        emphasize effective teamwork and group functioning, and those that
        emphasize speed and urgency.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">There
        are three important levers managers can use to influence the social
        control system of their units:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>shaping
        culture through participation or systems of involvement that lead people
        to feel responsible, using management behavior to convey vivid messages
        about what attitudes and behaviors are important, and designing
        comprehensive systems of reward and recognition that are targeted at
        those attitudes and behaviors critical for success.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Three
        characteristics of the participation process lead people toward

        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Managers
        design processes that label some decisions as important, get people

        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">How

        firms compete over time by actively shaping innovation streams.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>These streams include incremental innovation, architectural
        innovation and discontinuous innovation. By actively managing streams of
        innovation, firms take advantage of fundamentally new markets for
        existing technology and proactively introduce substitute products,
        which, even as they cannibalize existing products, create new markets
        and competitive rules.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Sustained
        competitive advantage involves producing streams of innovation. This

        that must be produced within a firm over time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Innovation streams highlight the importance of maintaining
        control over core product subsystems as well as shaping dominant designs
        and architectural innovation and initiating product substitutes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>By proactively shaping dominant designs, undertaking
        architectural innovations, and initiating product substitutes, managers
        can capitalize on windows of opportunity to shape technological
        evolution and, in turn, change the rules of the game.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">During
        periods of incremental change, organizations require units with
        relatively formalized roles and responsibilities, centralized

        engineered work processes, strong manufacturing and sales capabilities,
        and relatively homogeneous, older, and experienced human resources.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In

        product structures, experimental cultures, loose work processes, strong
        entrepreneurial and technical competencies, and relatively young and
        heterogeneous employees. Entrepreneurial units build new experience
        bases and knowledge systems. They generate the experiments, the
        failures, the variation from which the senior team can make bets on
        possible dominant designs and/or technological discontinuities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>In contrast to the larger, more mature units, these small
        entrepreneurial units are inefficient, rarely profitable, and do not

        lost.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The challenge for

        during the transition period.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Large-scale
        change often gets derailed because of inconsistencies in words and

        stories to illustrate the change in standards and direction.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A
        final action for encouraging appropriate behavior is building in
        stability, even as the change occurs.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>To mitigate the destructive aspects of political behavior,
        managers can begin by preparing key people for the change, providing
        information and detail on the change in advance, being honest and
        candid, and constantly sending consistent messages to lessen
        uncertainty.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Part of this
        signaling is to be clear about what is not changing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

        to be communicated and reinforced early on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

        <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The
        first and most important step in motivating constructive behavior is to

        <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">How
        do successful change managers generate the emotional energy to change?
        They create a credible crisis, whether the organization is failing and

        the crisis lies up ahead.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Managers
        of change must convey both a credible reason for the change and offer a
        constructive channel for the release of the anxiety.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Extremely anxious individuals have trouble focusing and
        listening.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So the rationale
        for the change needs to be simple, realistic, and over communicated.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

        use multiple levers to promote change, design transition management
        structures, and use feedback data to measure progress.</font></p>

        requires both creativity and discipline.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Strategic clarity alone is not sufficient.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Many competitors have similar visions and strategies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Success comes not from the articulation of vision, strategy, and
        objectives, but from their execution.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>To succeed, managers need to build organizations that are capable
        of accomplishing their strategic objectives more rapidly than their
        competitors.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>This requires that they build organizations to get today’s
        work done more effectively and no anticipate tomorrow’s
        discontinuities.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A
        crucial part of any manager’s job is setting and clarifying today’s
        most important organizational problems.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Without engaging problems, organizations become complacent and
        resistant to innovation and change.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Managers can define problems as real or potential gaps between
        strategic requirements and actual organizational performance. While it
        is easy to define problems when an organization is facing a crisis, it
        is more difficult to proactively create crises while an organization is
        successful.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Long-term
        innovation involves linking innovation steams, market requirements, and
        organizational capabilities.<span style="mso-spacerun:

        technology, marketing, or distribution, and linking them to develop
        products or services that meet customer requirements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Since managing innovation involves linking diverse competencies
        across multiple boundaries, executive teams must manage organizational
        processes down within their units, across with their peers, up with more
        senior mangers, and outside the firm with important suppliers, vendors,
        alliance partners, and customers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These
        external linkages often require managers to work without formal power or
        control. So, culture becomes an important factor.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Understanding
        the fundamental dynamics of integrated change management is a crucial
        determinant of successful innovation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>This means shaping the politics of change, dealing with
        individual anxiety and resistance, and maintaining control during
        transition periods.</font></p>

        difficulties of managing innovation are formidable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Leadership and organizational capabilities are more important
        than technological prowess. Effective innovation is achieved by managers
        who can build, embrace, and take advantage of the contradictions
        inherent in ambidextrous organizations. These managers are able to take
        advantage of and yet are not yet trapped by, today’s<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>culture and the firm’s historical success. They are able to
        implement change in proactive fashion in often complacent or inertial
