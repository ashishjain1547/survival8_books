        <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The basic economic resource,
        the means of production, is no longer capital, natural resources or
        labour but knowledge. Value is now created by “productivity” and
        “innovation,” both applications of knowledge to work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The leading social group of the emerging society will be
        knowledge workers who know how to allocate knowledge to productive use.
        Most of these knowledge people will be employees of organizations. But,
        unlike the employees under capitalism, they will own both the “means
        of production” and the “tools of production”. They will have
        stakes in pension funds, which are rapidly emerging in all developed
        countries as the only real owners. They will also own their knowledge
        and can take it with them wherever they go.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The economic challenge of the capitalist society will therefore
        be the productivity of knowledge worker.</font></p>
        <p style="text-align:justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">From
        capitalism to knowledge society</font></b></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">During the period 1750 to 1900,
        capitalism and technology conquered the globe and created a world
        civilization.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>This transformation was driven by a radical change in the
        meaning of knowledge.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In
        both West and East, knowledge had always been seen<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>applying to being.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then,
        almost overnight, it came to be applied to doing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Knowledge had always been a private good.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Almost overnight it became a public good.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">For a hundred years – during
        the first phase, knowledge was applied to tools, processes, products.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>This created the Industrial Revolution.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In its second phase, beginning
        around 1880 and culminating around the end of World War II, knowledge in
        its new meaning came to be applied to work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>This ushered in the productivity revolution, which in 75 years
        converted the proletarian into a middle-class with high income levels
        and defeated class war and Communism.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The last phase began after
        World War II. Today, knowledge is being applied to knowledge itself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Knowledge is now fast becoming the most important factor of
        production.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">There is one critical element,
        without which capitalism and technical advance<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>could not possibly have turned into a social and worldwide
        pandemic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That is the
        radical change in the meaning of knowledge that occurred in Europe
        around the year 1700, or shortly thereafter.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Socrates, held that the sole
        function of knowledge was self-knowledge: the intellectual, moral, and
        spiritual growth of the person.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For
        Protagoras, knowledge was to make the holder effective by enabling him
        to know what to say and how to say it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>For Protagoras, knowledge meant logic, grammar, and rhetoric.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>In the East, there were pretty much the same two theories of
        knowledge. Knowledge for the Confucian meant knowing what to say and how
        to say it as the route to advancement and earthly success.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Knowledge<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>for the
        Taoist and the Zen monk meant self-knowledge, and the road to
        enlightenment and wisdom.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But
        while the two sides thus sharply disagreed about what knowledge actually
        meant, they were in total agreement as to what it did not mean.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>It did not mean ability to do.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>It did not mean utility.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
        <p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">But
        today, the value of knowledge is judged by what it can do. Far too few
        people realize that the application of knowledge to work created
        developed economies by setting off the productivity explosion of the
        last hundred years.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Technologists give the credit to machines, economists to
        capital investment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Yet
        both were plentiful in the first hundred years of the capitalist age,
        before 1880, as they have been since.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>With respect to technology or to capital, the second hundred
        years differed very little from the first one hundred.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>But there was absolutely no increase in worker productivity
        during the first hundred years - and consequently very little increase
        in workers’ real incomes or any decrease in their working hours.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>What made the second hundred years so critically different can
        only be explained as the result of applying knowledge to work.</font></p>
        <p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">But
        by the early 1950s, the definition of a manager had already changed to
        one who “is responsible for the performance of people.” Today, the
        right definition of a manager is one who is “is responsible for the
        application and performance of knowledge.”</font></p>
        <p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Knowledge
        is now the essential resource.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Land,
        labor, and capital are restraints.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>With them, even knowledge cannot produce; without them, even
        management cannot perform.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But
        where there is effective application of knowledge to knowledge, other
        resources can always be mobilized.</font></p>
        <p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">That
        knowledge has become the resource, rather than a resource, is what makes
        our society “post-capitalist.” It has changed the structure of
        society.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It has created new
        social and economic dynamics and new politics.<b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><o:p>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">To maintain and strengthen a
        country’s manufacturing base and to ensure that it remains competitive
        surely deserves high priority.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But
        this means accepting that manual labor in making and moving things is
        rapidly becoming a liability rather than an asset.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Knowledge has become the key resource for all work. Creating<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>traditional manufacturing jobs is at best a short-lived
        expedient.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It may actually
        make things worse.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The only
        long term policy which promises success is for developed countries to
        convert manufacturing from being labor based into being knowledge based.</font></p>
        <p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Instead
        of being managed “in the best balanced interests of stakeholders,”
        corporations are now being managed exclusively to “maximize
        shareholder’s value”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This
        forces the corporation to be managed for the shortest term and damaging
        the wealth-producing capacity of the business.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>It means decline, and fairly swift decline.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Long-term results cannot be achieved by piling short-term results
        on short-term and long term needs and objectives. Moreover, managing a
        business exclusively for the shareholders alienates the very people on
        whose motivation and dedication the modern business depends: the
        knowledge workers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
        <p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In
        an economy of change and innovation, there is no such thing as
        “profit.” There are only costs: costs of the past and costs of an
        uncertain future.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And the
        minimum financial return from the operations of the past that is
        adequate to the costs of the future is the cost of capital.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
        <p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">An
        investor can always sell his holdings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>But the holdings of large pension funds are so big that they
        simply cannot be sold.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
        only market for them is other pension funds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Pension funds, in other words, can neither manage a business nor
        walk away from it.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>They have to make sure that the business is being managed.</font></p>
        <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Organizing
        for higher productivity </font></b><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></span></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Unless developed countries
        learn how to increase the productivity of knowledge workers and service
        workers, they will face economic stagnation and severe social tension.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>People can only get paid in accordance with their productivity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>It is productivity which creates the pool of wealth from which
        wages and salaries are then paid.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>If productivity does not go up, higher real incomes cannot be
        paid.</font></p>
        <p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In
        the work on productivity in making and moving things, the task is given
        and determined. In knowledge work, the machine serves the worker.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The task is not given; it has to be determined. In knowledge
        work, we have to decide how the work should be organized. What kind of
        human team is appropriate for this kind of work and its flow?</font></p>
        <p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Drucker
        makes his point on teams, with examples from sports. The first kind of
        team is exemplified by the baseball or cricket team; it is also the kind
        of team that operates on a patient in the hospital.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>In this team, players are part of the team but they do not play
        as a team.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But because all
        players occupy fixed positions, they can be given specific tasks of
        their own, can be measured by performance scores for each task, can be
        trained for each task.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It
        is by no means accidental that it in both baseball and cricket there are
        statistics on every player, going back for decades.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The surgical team in the hospital functions much the same way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>For repetitive tasks and for work in which the rules are well
        known, the baseball team is the ideal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>And it was this model on which modern mass production was
        organized.</font></p>
        <p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The
        second type of team is the soccer team.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>It is also the team concept on which the symphony orchestra is
        organized, and the model for the hospital team that rallies around the
        patient who goes into cardiac arrest early morning. This team requires a
        conductor or a coach.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And
        the word of the conductor or coach is law.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>It also requires a “score.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>And it requires endless rehearsals to work well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>But, unlike the baseball team, it has great flexibility, if the
        score is clear and if the team is well led.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>And it can move very fast.</font></p>
        <p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Finally,
        there is the doubles tennis team, which Drucker feels is the strongest
        team of all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Its total
        performance is greater than the sum of the individual performances of
        its members, for this team uses the strength of each member while
        minimizing the weaknesses of each.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>But this team requires enormous self-discipline.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The members have to work together for a long time before they
        actually function as a “team.”</font></p>
        <p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">These
        three types of teams cannot be mixed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>And to change from one team to another is exceedingly difficult
        and painful.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The change cuts across old, long-established, and cherished
        human relationships.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Yet
        any major change in the nature of the work, its tools, its flow, and its
        end product may require changing the team.</font></p>
        <p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In
        machine-paced work, the worker is servant to the machine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>In knowledge work the machine (if any) is a servant to the
        worker. Productivity requires the elimination of whatever activities do
        not contribute to performance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They
        sidetrack and divert from performance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Eliminating such work may be the single biggest step toward
        greater productivity in knowledge work.</font></p>
        <p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Knowledge
        workers should always be asked: “Is this work necessary to your main
        task? Does it contribute to your performance? Does it help you do your
        own job?”<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>And if the answer is no, the procedure or operation must
        either be dropped altogether or engineered into a job of its own.</font></p>
        <p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Defining
        performance; determining the appropriate work flow; setting up the right
        team; and concentrating on work and achievement are prerequisites for
        productivity in knowledge work and service work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Only when they have been done can we begin the work on making the
        individual job productive.</font></p>
        <p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Productivity
        in knowledge work demands that we build continuous learning into the job
        and into the organization.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Knowledge
        demands continuous learning because it is constantly changing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The best way for people to learn how to be more productive is for
        them to teach.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To obtain
        improvement in productivity, the organization has to become both a
        learning and a teaching organization.</font></p>
        <p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The
        structure of the post-capitalist society will be different from either
        the earlier capitalist or the socialist society.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>There, organizations tried to handle all activities.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Organizations of the post-capitalist society, by contrast,
        will concentrate on their core tasks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>For the rest, they will work with other organizations in a
        bewildering variety of alliances and partnerships.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>If capitalist and socialist societies were,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

        </span>An organization has full social responsibility for its impact on
        community and society, for the effluents it discharges into a local
        river, for example, or the traffic jam its work schedules create on the
        city streets.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But these are
        responsibilities that if not discharged, would seriously impede its
        capacity to perform its main task and mission.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>But where an organization has no competence, it has no
        responsibility. In fact, nothing is as damaging to an organization as an
        attempt at political power.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It
        always ends in disaster. A good example is the British East India
        Company.</font></p>
        <p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">No
        organization must be allowed power unless it is absolutely necessary to
        the discharge of its function.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Anything
        beyond this must be viewed as usurpation. Also the exercise of the
        organization’s legitimate power must be safeguarded against the abuse
        of power.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There must be
        clear and public rules for its exercise, and there must be review and
        appeal to some person or some tribunal that is impartial and not part of
        the problem.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There must be
        what lawyers call “due process.”</font></p>
        <p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">But
        the most important answer to the problem of the power of the
        organization is conversion from a power-based to a responsibility-based
        organization.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is the
        only answer, that fits the knowledge organization.</font></p>
        <p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The
        old-type organization assumed that the superior knew what the
        subordinate was doing, for the superior, only a few years earlier, had
        occupied the subordinate’s position.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The knowledge-based organization, by contrast, has to assume that
        superiors do not know the job of their subordinates because they may
        have never held their subordinates’ jobs.</font></p>
        <p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The
        knowledge-based organization therefore requires that everyone takes
        responsibility for the organization’s objectives, contribution, and,
        indeed, for its behaviour as well.</font></p>
        <p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">This
        implies that all members of the organization must think through their
        objectives and their contributions, and then take responsibility for
        both.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It implies that there
        are no “subordinates”; there are only “associates.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>In the knowledge-based organization all members have to be able
        to control their own work by feedback from their results to their
        objectives.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They must ask
        themselves: “What is the one major contribution to this organization
        and its mission which I can make at this particular time?”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>They must act as responsible decision makers.</font></p>
        <p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The
        task of management in the knowledge-based organization is not to make
        everybody a boss.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is to
        make everybody a contributor.</font></p>

        <p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The
        nation-state arose as a response to transnational drives.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>But the nation-state of 1970, a century later, bore little
        resemblance to earlier nation-states.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>It had mutuated into the Megastate. The nation state was designed
        to be the guardian of civil society.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The Megastate became its master.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>And in its extreme, totalitarian form, it replaced civil society
        completely.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The nation
        state was designed to protect both the citizen’s life and liberty and
        the citizen’s property against arbitrary acts of the sovereign.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The Megastate, even in its least extreme, considers a citizen’s
        property to be held only at the discretion of the tax collector.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
        <p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Beginning
        in the 1870s, regulation of business – banking, railways, electric
        power, telephones – was gradually established in the U S.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Such government regulation was clearly seen from the beginning as
        a “third way” between “unfettered” Capitalism and Socialism, and
        as a response to the tensions and problems created by the rapid spread
        of capitalism and technology.</font></p>
        <p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Until
        World War I, no government in history was ever able - even in wartime
        – to obtain from its people more than a very small fraction of the
        country’s national income, perhaps 5 or 6 percent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>But in World War I every belligerent nation, even the poorest,
        found that there was practically no limit to what government could
        squeeze out of the population. The Great Depression gave rise to the
        belief that the national government is - and should be in control of the
        economic weather.</font></p>
        <p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">By
        1960, the Megastate had become a political reality in developed
        countries in all its aspects: as social agency; as master of the
        economy; as fiscal state; and in many countries as a Cold War State. It
        had become the accepted doctrine in all developed Western countries that
        government is the appropriate agent for all social problems and all
        social tasks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact,
        nongovernmental, private activity in the social sphere became suspect.
        In the United States, government became the actual doer in the social
        sphere, especially in the attempt to change human behaviour in a
        multi-racial society by government action.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>According to Drucker, the one exception is Japan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The Japanese after World War II did not adopt the Cold War State.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Their government did not try to become<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>master of the economy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It
        did not try to become master of society.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Rather, it rebuilt itself after its shattering defeat on what in
        effect were traditional nineteenth-century lines.</font></p>
        <p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The
        Megastate has not been successful in bringing about a meaningful
        redistribution of income.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In
        fact, the past forty years have amply confirmed Pareto’s Law,
        according to which income distribution between major classes in society
        is determined only by two factors - the culture of the society, and the
        level of productivity within the economy.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The more productive an economy, the greater the equality of
        income; the less productive, the greater the inequality of income.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></p>
        <p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">As
        long as governments have been around, the budget process has begun with
        an assessment of the available revenues.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Expenditures then had to be fitted to these revenues. But since
        World War I, the budgeting process has meant, in effect, saying yes to
        everything. If budget making starts with expenditures, there is no
        fiscal discipline; government spending becomes the means for politicians
        to buy votes.</font></p>
        <p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Democratic
        government rests on the belief that the first job of elected
        representatives is to defend their constituents against rapacious
        government.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Megastate
        challenges this belief.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
        elected representatives fleece their constituents to enrich
        special-interest groups and thereby to buy their votes.</font></p>
        <p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Joseph
        Schumpeter warned in 1918 that the fiscal state would in the end
        undermine the<span style="mso-spacerun:

        </span>15 years later, Keynes hailed the fiscal state as the great
        liberator, Without<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>restraints
        on spending, Keynes felt government in the fiscal state could govern
        effectively. Clearly Schumpeter, not Keynes was right.</font></p>
        <p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The
        Megastate has been somewhat more successful in the social sphere than in
        the economic one.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But even
        here, it has not even earned a passing grade.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </span>It is time to acknowledge that government can set the rules, set
        the standards and provide.<span style="mso-spacerun:

        social sphere and confine itself to being the policy maker.<span style="mso-spacerun:

        <p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">None

        remain competitive in the world economy. It will be under increasing

        </span>In crucial areas, “sovereignty” has lost all meaning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Many of the new challenges simply cannot be dealt with by
        national or even international action.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>They require transnational agencies. Increasingly, regionalism is

        <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Control over money was at the
        very centre of what came to be called “sovereignty.” But today money
        has gone transnational.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It
        cannot be controlled any longer by nation states, not even by their
        acting together.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">No central bank any longer
        controls money flows.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It

        futility, military aid would surely be at the top of the things that
        have never worked, and therefore first on the list of things to abandon.
        To support a country that is under attack by a powerful enemy is one
        thing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But military aid to
        “friendly” regimes is extortion money. It only increases the

        the oft-invoked need to maintain a “military balance” in a region is
        pure sham.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In no instance

        Military aid has only stepped up the arms race.</font></p>
        <p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The
        economic performances of Japan and Germany during the past forty years
        both teach the same lesson. Countries should focus on the economic
        “climate” rather than the economic “weather.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The aim of economic policies must be to make the patient healthy
        to keep the patient healthy. It must be to create an economic
        environment in which the economy can grow; acquire resistance to

        <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The industries that have moved
        into the center of the economy in the last forty years have as their
        business the production and distribution of knowledge and information,
        rather than the production and distribution of things.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>In fact, whichever traditional industries managed to grow during
        the past forty years did so because they restructured themselves around
        knowledge and information. It is no longer possible to make huge profits
        by doing or moving things.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Increasingly,
        there is less and less return on the traditional resources: labor, land
        and (money) capital.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
        main producers of wealth have become information and knowledge.</font></p>
        <p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The
        knowledge-based economy does not behave the way existing theory assumes
        an economy to behave. One of the economists’ basic assumptions is that
        “perfect competition” is the model for the allocation of resources
        but also for the distribution of economic rewards.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Imperfect competition is common in the “real world.” But it
        is assumed to be the result of outside interference with the economy,
        i.e., of monopoly; of patent protection; of government regulation; and
        so on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But in the knowledge
        economy, imperfect competition seems to be inherent in the economy
        itself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Initial advantages
        gained through early application and exploitation of knowledge become
        permanent and irreversible.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
        <p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Another
        traditional assumption has been that an economy is determined either by
        consumption or by investment. In the knowledge economy, neither seems to
        be in control.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There is
        little evidence that increased consumption or investment in the economy
        leads to greater production of knowledge.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
        <p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">When
        it comes to new knowledge, there are three kinds. There is first the
        continuing improvement of process, product, service; the Japanese, who
        do it best, call this Kaizen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then
        there is exploitation: the continuous exploitation of existing knowledge
        to develop new and different products, processes, and services.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Finally, there is genuine innovation. These three ways of
        applying knowledge to produce change in the economy and in society need
        to be worked at together and at the same time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>They are all equally necessary.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>But their economic characteristics – their costs as well as
        their economic impacts are qualitatively different.</font></p>

        </span>Increasingly, productivity of knowledge will be decisive in its
        economic and social success, and in its entire economic performance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>And we know that there are tremendous differences in the
        productivity of knowledge across countries, across industries and across
        organizations.</font></p>
        <p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Making
        knowledge productive involves systematic, organized application of

        </span>The steps may be small and incremental but the goal must be
        ambitious.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Knowledge is
        productive only if it is applied to make a difference. Making knowledge
        productive further requires that it be clearly focused.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>It has to be highly concentrated.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Whether done by an individual or by a team, the knowledge effort

        <p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">To

        opportunities for change.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These
        opportunities have to be matched with the competences and strengths of
        the knowledge worker and the knowledge team.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
        <p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">To
        make knowledge productive also requires managing time. High knowledge
        productivity comes at the end of a long gestation period.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Yet productivity of knowledge also requires a constant stream of
        short-term results.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It thus
        requires balancing the long term with the short term.</font></p>
        <p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Drucker
        also emphasizes the learning-doing gap. Most of us know many times more
        than we put to use.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
        main reason is that we do not mobilize the multiple knowledge we
        possess.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We do not use
        knowledges as part of one toolbox.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Instead of asking: “What do I know, what have I learned, that
        might apply to this task?” we tend to classify tasks in terms of
        specialized knowledge areas.</font></p>
        <p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Specialization
        in knowledge has given us enormous performance potential in each area.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>But because knowledge has become so specialized, we need also
        a process to turn this potential into performance. Otherwise, most of
        the available knowledge will not become productive; it will remain mere
        information.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
        <p style="text-align:justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">The
        role of educational institutions</font></b></p>
        <p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In
        the West, the school underwent an earlier technological revolution
        several hundred years ago, brought about by the printed book.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>This earlier revolution holds important lessons for today.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Embracing the new technology of learning and teaching is a
        prerequisite for national and cultural success and equally for economic
        competitiveness.</font></p>
        <p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The
        West moved into leadership throughout the world between 1500 and 1650 in
        large measures because it reorganized its schools around the new
        technology of the printed book.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>On
        the other hand, the refusal of China and Islam to accept the printed
        book was a major factor in their decline.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Both used printing – the Chinese had done so for centuries.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>But both kept the printed book out of their schools; both
        rejected it as a learning and technical tool.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The Islamic clergy stuck to rote learning. They saw in the
        printed book a threat to their authority precisely because it enabled
        students to read on their own.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>In China, too, the Confucian scholars rejected the printed
        book in favor of calligraphy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
        printed book was incompatible with a key tenet of Chinese culture:
        mastery of calligraphy was necessary for rulership.</font></p>
        <p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The
        earlier revolution offers an important lesson: Technology itself matters
        less than the changes which it triggers in substance, content, and focus
        of schooling and school.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These
        changes in substance, content, and focus are what really matter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>They are effective even if there is only a minimum of change in
        the technology of learning and teaching.</font></p>
        <p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The
        achievement that motivates is doing exceptionally well what one is
        already good at.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Achievement has to be based on the student’s strengths as
        has been known for millennia by every teacher of artists, every coach of
        athletes, every mentor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In
        fact, finding the student’s strengths and focusing them on achievement
        is the best definition of both teacher and teaching.</font></p>
        <p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Continuing
        education is now a social necessity. Individuals must be able at any
        stage in their lives to continue their formal education and to qualify
        for knowledge work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Society
        needs to be willing to accept people into whatever work they are
        qualified for, regardless of their age.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>School, as has been said before, has traditionally been where one
        learns. The office or factory has been where one works.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Increasingly, the line will become blurred. The school will be
        the place where adults continue learning even though they are working
        full time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They will come
        back to school for part time courses. Schools will no longer be
        monopolists.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In many areas,
        schools will only be only one of several available teaching and learning
        institutions, in competition with other purveyors of teaching and
        learning.</font></p>
        <p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Indeed,
        no other institution faces challenges as radical as those that will
        transform the school. The school will have to commit itself to results.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>It will have to establish its “bottom line,” the performance
        for which it should be held responsible and for which it is being paid.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The school will finally become accountable.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In the knowledge society into
        which we are moving, individuals are central. Knowledge is not
        impersonal, like money.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Knowledge
        does not reside in a book, a databank, a software program.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Knowledge is always embodied in person; carried by a person;
        created, augmented, or improved by a person; applied by a person; taught
        and passed on by a person; used or misused by a person.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The shift to the knowledge society therefore puts the person in
        the center.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In so doing, it
        raises new challenges, new issues, new and quite unprecedented questions
        about the knowledge society’s representative, the educated person.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Post capitalist society needs
        the educated person even more than any earlier society did.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Access to the great heritage of the past will have to be an
        essential element.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But this
        heritage will embrace a good deal more than the civilization that is
        still mainly Western, the Judeo-Christian tradition, for which the
        Humanists are fighting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
        educated person we need will have to be able to appreciate other
        cultures and traditions: the great heritage of Chinese, Japanese, Korean
        paintings and ceramics; the philosophers and religious of the Orient;
        and Islam, both as a religion and as a culture.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The educated person also will have to be far less exclusively
        “bookish” than the product of the liberal education of the
        Humanists.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Tomorrow’s educated person
        will have to be prepared for life in a global world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>It will be a “Westernized” world, but also increasingly a
        tribalized world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He or she
        must become a “citizen of the world” – in vision, horizon,
        information.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But he or she
        will also have to appreciate the importance<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>and impact of local culture.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Individuals see organizations
        as the means for exploiting their knowledge.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Managers see knowledge as a means to achieving the
        organization’s ends. A good many people in the post-capitalist society
        will actually live and work in these two cultures at the same time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Many more should be exposed to working experience in both
        cultures, by rotation early in their careers – from a specialist’s
        job to a managerial one, for instance, rotating the young computer
        technician into project manager and team leader, or by asking the young
        college professor to work part time for two years in university
        administration. And again, working as “unpaid staff” in an agency of
        the social sector will give the individual the perspective, the balance
        to respect both worlds, that of the intellectual and that of the
        manager.</font></p>
        <p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">But

        about? What is it trying to do? What are its central concerns and
        theories? What major new insights has it produced? What are its
        important areas of ignorance, its problems, its challenges?&nbsp;<o:p>

        <p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Without

        sterile, will indeed cease to be “knowledge.” They will become
        intellectually arrogant and unproductive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>For the major new insights in every one of the specialized
        knowledges arise out of another, separate specialty, out of another
        field of the knowledge.&nbsp;<o:p>

        </span>All knowledges are equally valuable; all knowledges, in the words
        of the great medieval saint and philosopher St. Bonaventura, lead
        equally to the truth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But
        to make them paths to truth, paths to knowledge, has to be the
