        <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000000">This
        book is based on an in depth study of Japan conducted by three eminent
        scholars, Michael Porter of Harvard Business School, Hirotaka Takeuchi
        of Hitotsubashi University and Mariko Sakakibara of the University
        college of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Los Angeles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Porter needs no introduction.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>His books, Competitive Strategy, Competitive Advantage and
        Competitive Advantage of Nations are master pieces.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Takeuchi is known for his brilliant book “The
        Knowledge-creating company.”<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>He is one of Japan’s most famous management gurus.
        Sakakibara has done a lot of research on Japan’s global
        competitiveness. It comes as no surprise that when such eminent scholars
        come together, remarkable insights emerge.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000000">&nbsp;Japan’s
        success has fascinated many western management scholars and practicing
        managers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Early studies
        attributed Japan’s emergence as one of the leading players in the
        global economy to two sets of factors: enlightened government
        intervention (or state capitalism as termed by some economists) and
        unique Japanese management practices such as life time employment,
        continuous improvement, total quality management and just-in-time
        production.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The study
        conducted by Porter, Takeuchi and Sakakibara reveals that the government
        has played a marginal role in the development of Japan’s most
        competitive industries like cars and video recorders.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>And where the government has been<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>actively involved in sectors such as chemicals and aircraft, the
        results have been disappointing. Right from the preface, the authors
        make it clear that Japan has succeeded in spite of and not due to
        government intervention. The authors also emphasise that while Japan
        must continue to leverage on some of its unique management practices, it
        must also learn to change with the times.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>They argue that the need of the hour for Japan is to encourage
        competition wherever it is absent. “We will demonstrate in the pages
        that follow that Japan is not a special case after all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Its industries succeed not when the government manages
        competition but when it allows competition to flourish.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>And Japanese companies succeed when they follow the accepted
        principles of strategy.”</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000000">&nbsp;In
        recent times, Japan has been going through a recession.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>And western leaders and business journalists have been regularly
        taking pot shots at the country.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Various
        macro economic reasons have been given to explain Japan’s plight.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The authors point out such explanations are unsatisfactory.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>They reiterate Porter’s argument in his book, “The
        Competitive Advantage of Nations,” that a nation’s competitiveness
        is essentially determined by micro economic factors.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After all, it is companies and not countries which
        compete in the global market place. They point out that in Japan,
        globally competitive industries such as cars coexist with uncompetitive
        ones like agriculture, chemicals, computer software and retailing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>If the role of the government had been that critical, industries
        would have been uniformly competitive or uncompetitive.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000000">&nbsp;Indeed
        the coexistence of both highly competitive and uncompetitive industries
        in Japan has been discussed by other scholars.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>In his influential article, “Fixing Japan’s white-collar
        economy: A personal view,”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title><span style="mso-special-character:footnote" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[2]</span></a>
        Shintaro Hori, pointed out that Japan’s impressive economic
        performance (Japan’s GDP grew from one quarter to one half of the US
        GDP during the period 1985 to 1991) could not hide the fact that many of
        Japan’s domestic businesses (accounting for almost 80% of the economy)
        were quite uncompetitive: “Without the challenge of international
        competitors to press them into shape, the majority of Japan’s domestic
        companies have become complacent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This
        is especially true in the service, construction and food-production
        sectors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>One could say that
        there are in effect, two Japans, which are operating under two
        fundamentally different economic codes.”</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000000">&nbsp;The
        book quickly explodes several myths.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Contrary to popular belief government supported cartels have not
        boosted Japan’s competitiveness.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Cartels are common in uncompetitive industries but rare in
        competitive ones.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Cooperative
        government initiated R&amp;D projects have also had a marginal role to
        pay in boosting competitiveness.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>As the authors put it: “Despite conventional wisdom and the
        fact that the Japanese government has fought hard to preserve its
        approach, the great preponderance of evidence points to the Japanese
        government model as a cause of failure, not the source of the Japanese
        Miracle.”</font></p>

        are produced. Improving efficiency alone, or producing more units per
        unit of labour or capital does not necessarily elevate wages and profits
        unless the prices of the products or services are stable or rising.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>As global competition places greater pressure on the prices of
        standard goods, efficiency alone is insufficient.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Advanced nations improve their standard of living more by driving
        up the value of their products and services and moving into new fields

              Richard Pascale and Anthony Athos, in their classic book, “The
              Art of Japanese Management” (1981)<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>developed the 7 S framework.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>They identified three ‘hard’ elements of management<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>– Strategy, Structure and Systems and four ‘soft’
              elements – Staff, Style, Skills and Super ordinate goals.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>Traditionally, American companies unlike Japanese companies
              have paid less attention to the soft aspects.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>But there have been exceptions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>For example, IBM has paid as much attention to the
              recruitment and indoctrination of staff and the inculcation of
              super ordinate goals, as Matsushita.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>(Till its downsizing in the 1990s, IBM has also been famous
              for its life time employment practices.)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>The authors concluded that American companies had to link
              corporate purpose and ways of realizing it to human values as well
              as to economic measures like profit and efficiency.<o:p>

              in his influential article, “The end of lifetime employment in

        Hirakubo puts it, “Japanese corporate training is aimed at creating a

        <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000000">Based
        on the analysis of the factors influencing Japan’s competitiveness,
        the authors emphasise that the government’ role has to change: “Now
        government must work to improve the inputs available to business,
        facilitate competition and encourage innovation. Improving the quality
        and dynamism of the business environment, not managing the competitive
        process, should be the government’s new goal.” In other words, the
        Japanese government has to allow more free play of market forces to
        ensure that only the most competitive companies remain. It should also
        build a safety net to ease the impact of restructuring on workers.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The government can also improve corporate governance by
        stricter disclosure norms.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There
        is one area where the Japanese government has done good work in the
        past, i.e., strict quality, safety and environmental regulation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The authors argue that this should not be diluted.
        </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000000">At
        a firm level, Porter, Takeuchi and Sakakibara, call for a new approach
        to competing.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead of being obsessed with operational effectiveness,
        Japanese companies should attempt to be more unique and more different
        from competitors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately,
        Japan’s traditional consensus oriented style of management encourages
        the tendency of trying to be all things to all people.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>But as Porter has repeatedly mentioned in his other books too,
        strategy is all about making trade-offs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>It is not about doing everything but about making tough decisions
        about what not to do.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is
        about doing things differently from what competitors are doing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>
        </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000000">When
        it comes to operational effectiveness, Japanese companies need to change
        their broad game plan. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>They
        need to tap sources they have ignored so far.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>For example, they need to understand and exploit the full
        potential of information technology.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The authors argue that there is substantial scope for improving
        Japanese white collar productivity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Here, the American companies seem to be far ahead.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Nakato Hirakubo and Hori also emphasise this point. As Hirakubo
        mentions in his insightful article, “The End of Lifetime Employment in
        Japan,”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title><span style="mso-special-character:footnote" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[5]</span></a>:
        “Japan’s white-collar workers are only two-thirds as efficient as
        their American counterparts… PC operations and English-speaking
        abilities are essential in today’s business environment, regardless of
        industry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But in Japan,
        there are still many middle-aged who have never touched a key board.”<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;</span>
        </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000000">Japanese
        companies also need to eliminate their obsession with market share,
        which they often pursue at the expense of profitability. This is
        currently reflected in the way they report their performance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Market share data are more easily available in Japan than
        elsewhere in the world but profitability data are scarce and unreliable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>As the authors put it, “Profitability is the only reliable
        guide to developing strategy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Pursuing
        the goal of profitability will require fundamental shifts in the values
        that underlie Japanese business practice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Earning a good return on investment must be seen as the ultimate
        test of a company’s success in increasing economic, customer and
        social value.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Capital must
        be seen as a valuable resource to be used efficiently.”</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000000">The
        authors offer useful advice for Japanese companies. They must withdraw
        from unrelated businesses and sharpen their business focus.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>A new breed of leaders who emphasise innovative thinking and risk
        taking must be encouraged.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Corporate
        governance practices also need to be improved, by taking specific
        measures such as appointing more external directors on the board.
        </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000000">Having
        said that Porter, Takauchi and Sakakibara stress that the old virtues of
        the Japanese corporate model must be retained.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>These include a long term orientation, treating employees as
        assets, close relationships with suppliers, investments to improve
        technology and ongoing improvements in manufacturing productivity.
        </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000000">Many
        observers have become cynical about Japan’s ability to regain its
        global competitiveness. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>But
        the authors remain optimistic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They
        point out that Japanese companies are still competitive in many areas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The country’s primary education system is world class. The new
        breed of Japanese<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>managers
        is demonstrating its ability to change.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Entrepreneurship is also on the rise.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Meanwhile, external pressures are also forcing change on the
        Japanese corporate sector.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Foreign
        investors are acquiring significant stakes in Japanese companies
        encouraged by low equity prices.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Foreign
        Direct Investment is also on the rise.
        </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000000">Meanwhile,
        the younger Japanese executives are also acting as a catalyst for
        change.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>They are neither fascinated by nor expect to be protected by
        lifetime employment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They
        are more comfortable with merit based compensation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>They are also prepared to accept change.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The growing use of the internet, increasing tendency for
        youngsters to set up their own businesses and more freedom for women are
        all clear signs that Japan is changing.
        </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000000">In
        the 1940s and 1950s, Japan competed mainly on the basis of low wages and
        low prices, selling cheap imitations of western goods.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Then, Japan changed remarkably and its companies began to compete
        on quality.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The challenge
        for many Japanese companies today is to move on to the next stage –
        competing on the basis of strategy and innovations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Instead of incremental improvements and operational excellence,
        Japan needs a new mindset that encourages innovation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>authors are
        quite confident that Japan is ready for this change.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Here, they share the opinion of Diana Helweg<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title><span style="mso-special-character:footnote" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[6]</span></a>,
        “The Japanese moved further and faster than anyone ever expected
        during both the Meiji<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>restoration
        and the recovery after World War II.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>There is every reason to expect that Japan will do so again –
        winning the battle between status quo and reform.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>But more fundamentally than even the Meiji and post war periods,
        this revolution will rebuild Japan’s economic foundation from the
        ground up. Although rebuilding the Japanese economy will be no easier
        now than it was during the Meiji Restoration or after World War II, the
        present changes are more fundamental than anything the country has ever
        seen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Japan’s
        revolutionary growth will utterly transform it from the state-run
        industrial powerhouse of the twentieth century towards an
        innovation-driven, globalized economy of the twenty first.”
