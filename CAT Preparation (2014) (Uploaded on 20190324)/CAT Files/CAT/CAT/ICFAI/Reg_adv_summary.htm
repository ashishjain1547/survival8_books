        differences between Silicon Valley &amp; Route 128</font></h2>
        <p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The
        author argues that Silicon Valley has done well because of a regional
        network-based industrial system that promotes collective learning and
        flexible adjustment among specialist producers of various related
        technologies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
        region’s dense social networks and open labor markets have encouraged
        experimentation and entrepreneurship.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Companies compete intensely. But they also learn from one another
        about changing markets and technologies through informal communication
        and collaborative practices. Loosely linked team structures encourage
        horizontal communication across divisions and with outside suppliers and
        customers.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Silicon
        Valley’s decentralized system has encouraged the pursuit of multiple
        technical opportunities through spontaneous regroupings of skill,
        technology, and capital.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Distinctions
        between large and small firms and between industries or sectors are
        minimal.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In
        contrast to Silicon Valley, the Route 128 region has been dominated by a
        small number of relatively integrated corporations. Its industrial
        system is based on independent firms that internalize a wide range of
        productive activities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Practices
        of secrecy and corporate loyalty govern relations between firms and
        their customers, suppliers, and competitors. This has promoted a culture
        that encourages stability and self-reliance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Corporate hierarchies ensure that authority remains centralized
        and information tends to flow vertically.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The boundaries between and within firms and between firms and
        local<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>institutions are much
        sharper in this independent firm-based system.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The
        independent firm-based industrial system flourished in an environment of
        market stability and slow-changing technologies because its leading
        producers benefited from the advantages of scale economies and market
        control.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>But under more volatile conditions, the system has come under
        pressure.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Route
        128 seemed to have the early mover advantage compared to Silicon Valley.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>More than two centuries of industrialization laid the
        foundation for the postwar surge of activity in electronics in the
        Boston area. The Santa Clara Valley, by contrast, remained an
        agricultural region as late as the 1940s, famous primarily for its
        apricot and walnut orchards.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">But
        different strategies were pursued by the two regions, leading to
        different consequences. Both Stanford and MIT encouraged commercially
        oriented research and courted federal research contracts in the postwar
        years. But MIT focused on building relations with government agencies
        and seeking financial support from established electronics producers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>MIT felt that investing in technology start-ups was too risky and
        not consistent with prudence, discretion, and intelligence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>In spite of the university’s commitment to commercially
        relevant research, it kept firms at arm’s length. Whereas,
        Stanford’s leaders, lacking corporate or government ties or even easy
        proximity to Washington, actively promoted the formation of new
        technology enterprises and forums for cooperation with local industry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>This contrast – between MIT’s orientation toward Washington
        and large, established producers and Stanford’s emphasis on
        collaborative relationships among small firms –fundamentally shaped
        the industrial systems in the two regions.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="4" color="#800000">The
        evolution of Silicon Valley</font></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Silicon
        Valley’s origins are typically traced to the founding of the
        Hewlett-Packard Company (HP) in 1937.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>HP’s fortunes, like those of many of its East Coast
        counterparts, were shaped by the war.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>A small cluster of prewar technology firms grew up alongside HP
        to provide a foundation for the region’s emerging electronics
        industry.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Like
        in case of Boston, the Second World War marked a turning point for the
        Santa Clara Valley.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Large
        numbers of people were attracted to war-related industries in the San
        Francisco Bay area.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>While military demand dramatically improved the fortunes of
        Northern California firms, the government awarded the majority of the
        wartime military electronics<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>contracts
        to large East Coast companies.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In
        university education also, Silicon Valley was handicapped. Unlike MIT,
        Stanford had not been significantly involved in any of the exciting
        engineering and scientific activities associated with the war. Fred
        Terman, often called the father of Silicon Valley built the electrical
        engineering program at Stanford into one of the best in the country by
        recruiting promising engineering faculty and expanding its graduate
        programs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>By 1950, Stanford
        was awarding as many doctorates in electrical engineering as MIT,
        despite its much smaller faculty.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Terman
        encouraged faculty and students to learn more about the region’s
        business and the opportunities there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Three initiatives helped Stanford to work closely with industry.
        First, Stanford established the Stanford Research Institute (SRI) to
        conduct defense-related research and to assist West Cost business.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Second, Stanford opened its classrooms to local companies through
        the Honors Cooperative Program.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Third,
        Terman promoted the development of the Stanford Industrial Park, one of
        the first such parks in the country.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>These innovations introduced in the 1950s, went a long way in
        promoting industry – university linkages.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A
        combination of university research, military spending, and
        entrepreneurial<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>risk-talking gave momentum to the process of industrial
        development in the valley.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>By
        1975 the region’s technology enterprises employed well over 100,000
        workers. The Valley’s agglomeration of engineers, electronics firms,
        specialist consultants, venture capitalists, and supplier infrastructure
        was paralleled only by that of its East Coast counterpart.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>While Route 128 specialized in minicomputers, Silicon Valley
        excelled in commercial semiconductors.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The
        absence of any pedigree and its distance from established economic and
        political institutions facilitated experimentation with novel and
        productive relationships.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Terman
        promoted<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>more open and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>reciprocal
        ties between<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Stanford and
        local industry than existed in the Route 128 region.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Firms
        were organized as loosely linked confederations of engineering teams.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Without intending to do so, Silicon Valley’s engineers and
        entrepreneurs created a more flexible industrial system, one organized
        around the region and its professional and technical networks rather
        than around the individual firm. Many Silicon Valley entrepreneurs
        became millionaires. And some did flaunt their wealth. But they were
        often motivated less by money and more by the challenge of independently
        pursuing a new technological opportunity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Status was defined less by economic success and more by
        technological achievement.&nbsp;<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In
        the valley, the venture capitalists were not finance professionals.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>They were entrepreneurs who created and built a company and then
        sold out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When problems
        occurred with any of their investments, they would step into the
        business and help out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Geographic
        proximity helped build and sustain these relationships.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Industrial
        fragmentation contributed to the flexibility and resilience of the
        industrial fabric. Competitive rivalries encouraged technological
        advance among local producers, but it was not a no-hold-barred battle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The Valley’s business culture encouraged intense involvement
        and enthusiasm among the workforce.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The system rewarded performance rather than seniority.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>It ensured the diffusion of understanding the knowledge of
        both the firm and the industry among all levels of the workforce, from
        lowest technicians to senior engineers.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="4" color="#800000">The
        development of Route 128</font></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Entrepreneurs
        along Boston’s Route 128 inherited and reproduced an industrial order
        based on independent firms.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Secrecy
        and territoriality guided relations between individuals and firms.
        Traditional hierarchies prevailed within firms. Relations with local
        institutions were distant – even antagonistic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>As they grew, Route 128 companies built self-contained and
        vertically integrated structures. This created a regional economy
        consisting of a collection of autonomous enterprises, lacking social or
        commercial interdependencies.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Engineers
        generally went home after work rather than getting together to gossip or
        discuss their views of markets or technologies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The social gathering places that were common in Silicon Valley
        were rare on Route 128.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Stability
        and company loyalty were valued over experimentation and risk-taking in
        the Route 128 region.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Interfirm
        mobility became a way of life in Silicon Valley during the 1960s and
        1970s. But Route 128 executives considered job-hopping unacceptable and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>emphasized loyalty to the employer.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Risk-avoidance
        became self-reinforcing along Route 128.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>There were only a few role models like Ken Olsen and An Wang to
        inspire potential entrepreneurs. And they were often secretive and
        private individuals.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Route
        128 entrepreneurs tended to remain with the firms they started. They did
        not move on to start new ventures, as in Silicon Valley.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The
        Route 128 venture capital industry was managed by finance professionals
        rather than entrepreneurs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
        VCs did not have the operating experience in the technology industry
        that would enable them to assist a business that ran into problems.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Employees
        in Route 128 firms typically worked their way up the corporate hierarchy
        and retired with a comfortable pension.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The typical corporation in the region also had significant status
        differences.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Formal lines
        of authority and procedures as well as salaries and benefits created
        barriers between functions and corporate ranks.</font></p>

        and recovery in the valley</b></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Both
        Silicon Valley and Route 128 firms, after the boom of the late 1970s and
        early 1980s fell into a crises during the mid-1980s.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Semiconductor industry leaders in the valley felt that the
        challenge was no longer to advance technology but mass manufacture
        standard devices. For the valley companies, used to a decentralized,
        network-based system, the shift to high-volume semi conductor production
        marked an important discontinuity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>In their rush to achieve manufacturing scale efficiencies, they
        abandoned the social structure and institutions they had pioneered and
        began to attach greater importance to learning curves and economies of
        scale.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Silicon
        Valley’s semiconductor firms transformed themselves to embrace the new
        mass manufacturing paradigm. But they did not recognize the impact of
        their break with the past.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They
        saw the shift to mass production as a natural and inevitable stage in
        their industry’s maturation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They
        brushed aside the open exchange and informal collaboration that had
        allowed them to design new products and develop innovative applications
        in an earlier era. They frequently abandoned the local culture and
        relationships that had been the source of their earlier dynamism.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>They distanced themselves from customers and antagonized
        equipment suppliers. Functional management hierarchies evolved. The
        production process became separated from R&amp;D.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Faced
        with rapidly falling prices, valley companies attempted to shift the
        burden of increasingly severe business cycles onto their equipment
        suppliers, which tended to be small, undercapitalized firms by ordering
        heavily during boom times and canceling orders abruptly during
        downturns.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They pitted key
        vendors against one another for price reductions in order to minimize
        costs. They were unwilling to fund the development of new equipment,
        seeking rather to buy the lowest-cost equipment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The semiconductor makers also refused to share proprietary
        product or process information with their vendors out of concern for the
        security of technical information in an increasingly competitive
        business.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The
        Valley semiconductor firms saw little need for the ongoing interaction
        with customers that had characterized custom production.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>They became preoccupied with rewriting the specs for a successive
        generation of high-volume products, and gained a reputation for their
        arrogant “take it or leave it” attitudes.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The
        leading Silicon Valley firms like National, Intel, and AMD built
        bureaucratic organizations that centralized authority and undermined the
        autonomy of formerly independent business units.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>In the process, they sacrificed organizational flexibility.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Though
        Silicon Valley ran into a crisis following the collapse of the
        semiconductor memory business, it recovered smartly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>A wave of start-ups and the restructuring of several large firms
        fueled industrial diversification and renewed regional growth.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">While
        Silicon Valley was no longer the tightly knit community of technological
        pioneers of earlier decades, the culture of relative openness, the fast
        pace of business activity, and the cooperative practices that
        distinguished the region remained intact.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>There were many failures in Silicon Valley in the 1980s.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>But valley entrepreneurs viewed failure as an opportunity for
        learning.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The
        formation of new businesses enabled many more technical paths to be
        pursued in Silicon Valley than would have been possible in either a
        traditional large firm or a region with less fluid social and industrial
        structures.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Valley
        entrepreneurs of the 1980s, like those of earlier decades, were
        typically engineers who had not been allowed to pursue new ideas within

        capabilities and know-how in the region remained locked up within large
        firms.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The paucity of
        horizontal communications stifled opportunities for experimentation and
        learning. Traditional corporate structures limited the development of
        managerial initiative and skill.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>While
        Route 128’s skill base and supplier infrastructure were ahead of most
        other regions, by the mid-1980s they were neither as technologically
        sophisticated nor as diversified as is the Valley. The decline of Route
        128 accelerated as many of its most experienced and ambitious engineers
        decided to move to the Valley sensing more opportunities there.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="4" color="#800000">The
        Valley’s resurgence</font></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The
        Valley’s new start-ups explicitly rejected the corporate models of
        their predecessors. They pioneered not only products but also corporate
        strategies and structures, revitalizing the traditions of innovation and
        responsiveness that had characterized the Valley in its early decades.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>They<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>quickly
        realised that they were no match for low-margin Japanese commodity
        producers. So, they decided to concentrate on design-intensive, high
        value-added specialty and semi-custom semiconductors. They introduced
        specialized, design-intensive devices that allowed them to define new
        markets and avoid the price wars common in commodity markets.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Their flexible and decentralized organizations allowed them to
        respond rapidly to market changes. They produced small quantities of
        complex, high-value-added components.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead of attempting to achieve scale economies, these
        chipmakers introduced a continuing stream of differentiated products.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The
        semiconductor start-ups in the valley also increased their flexibility
        by unbundling semiconductor production.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Whereas established firms had designed, manufactured, and
        assembled integrated circuits in-house, the new firms typically focused
        on either chip design, manufacturing or marketing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Reliance on external manufacturers allowed small semiconductor
        makers to avoid the cost and risk of a fabrication facility and to use
        multiple foundries to optimize their designs.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Strategies
        pursued in Silicon Valley turned out to be highly effective.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>They restored the vibrancies of the past.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Commodity chips generated 80 percent of worldwide semiconductor
        industry revenues in 1983, but by 1990 their share had fallen to 33
        percent.&nbsp;<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The
        Valley also outgrew its origins as a center of semiconductor production
        during the 1980s to become a complex of computer-related specialists.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The new semiconductor firms allied themselves with computer
        start-ups in order both to influence and to respond to changing systems
        requirements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The computer
        companies in turn incorporated specialty or semi-custom chips in
        smaller, more differentiated systems.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The
        new generation of computer start-ups that emerged in the Valley during
        the 1980s adopted strategies similar to those of their semiconductor
        counterparts.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Firms such as Sun Microsystems, Silicon Graphics, MIPS
        Computer Systems, MasPar, and Pyramid Technology created new markets and
        developed differentiated services and applications. They did not just
        concentrate on lowering manufacturing costs on standardized systems.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">By
        the end of the 1980s, the Valley was the home of increasingly
        diversified networks of specialized equipment, component, subsystem, and
        software producers, including firms that specialized in disk drives
        (such as Conner peripherals, Maxtor, and Quantum), networking and
        communications products (such as 3Com, Excelan, Cisco, and Bridge
        Communications), computer-aided design and engineering systems (Daisy
        Systems, Cadence Design, and Valid Logic Systems), and color displays (SuperMac,
        Radius, and RasterOps). During the 1980s a new crop of manufacturers of
        semiconductor equipment and materials (such as Novellus Systems, Lam
        Research, and Genus), makers of disk drive equipment and components
        (such as Read-Rite, Komag, and Helios), and providers of contract
        manufacturing services (such as Solectron, Flextronics, and Logistix)
        emerged in the Valley.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">While
        the Valley’s entrepreneurs rejected the experience of their
        crisis-ridden predecessors, Route 128 entrepreneurs tended to model
        their companies after the region’s large minicomputer firms.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Many of these new firms created inward-looking organizations that
        were as out of touch with customers and market trends as those of their
        predecessors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As a result,
        the decline of Route 128 could not be reversed.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">During
        the 1980s, the Valley transformed itself. The categories by which
        businesses traditionally defined themselves became irrelevant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Intense competitors became partners, sectoral lines merged and
        faded as technology advanced. The distinctions between large and small
        firms all but collapsed.&nbsp;<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Companies
        like Sun Microsystems and Silicon Graphics responded to rising
        development costs, shrinking product cycles, and rapid technological
        change by building production networks from the bottom up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>By focusing on their core competencies and purchasing the
        remainder from specialist suppliers, they created a network system that
        spread the cost of developing new technologies, reduced
        product-development times, and fostered reciprocal innovation.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The
        Valley’s computer firms redefined relations with their most important
        suppliers during the 1980s.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They
        began treating them as partners in a joint process of designing,
        developing, and manufacturing innovative systems. Loyalty grew out of a
        reciprocal decision to honor unwritten obligations as well as contracts
        and not to take advantage of one another when market conditions changed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Suppliers became involved in the design and development of new
        systems and components at a very early stage, and they often became
        integrated into the customer’s organization in the process.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The
        Valley-based computer makers often preferred local suppliers,
        particularly for technologically complex or customized parts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>This desire for geographic proximity was not reducible to cost
        considerations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Most saw
        the advantages of timely delivery but also recognized that it was
        difficult to create over long distances the trust and teamwork needed
        for collaborative supplier relations. As a result, the Valley’s
        cluster strengthened further.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In
        the early 1990s, the region’s computer firms collaborated with media
        and publishing companies and consumer electronics firms to create
        innovative multimedia and interactive entertainment and education
        products. They built on telecommunications technologies to introduce new
        generations of video conferencing, electronic mail, and handheld
        communications devices.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
        boundaries of the computer industry thus continued to dissolve as local
        producers continued to define new products, markets, and industries.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="4" color="#800000">Concluding
        Notes</font></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The
        author concludes that industrial systems built on regional networks are
        more flexible and technologically more vibrant than those in which
        experimentation and learning are confined to individual firms.</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Local
        factors continue to be important even in a globalising economy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Geographic proximity promotes the repeated interaction and mutual
        trust needed to sustain collaboration and to speed the continual
        recombination of technology and skill.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>When production is embedded in these regional social structures
        and institutions, firms compete by translating local knowledge and
        relationships into innovative products and services. Industrial
        specialization becomes a source of flexibility rather than of atomism
        and fragmentation.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The
        historical evolution of a cluster is significant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Route 128’s technology firms inherited a business model and a
        social and institutional setting from an earlier industrial era.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>When technology remained relatively stable over time, vertical
        integration and corporate centralization offered needed scale economies
        and market control.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But
        when technologies and markets become more volatile, the horizontal
        coordination provided by interfirm networks became more important.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>They enable firms to retain the focus and flexibility needed for
        continuous innovation.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The
        semiconductor crisis of the mid-1980s in the valley underscores
        potential weaknesses of its decentralized system.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Network systems, like all forms of productive organization, are
        fragile constructs that must be continually renewed and redefined to
        meet new economic challenges.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The
        author emphasizes that regional policy is likely to be as important as
        macroeconomic or sectoral polices to ensuring industrial competitiveness
        in the 1990s.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Regional
        policymakers have to create institutions that promote a decentralized
        process of industrial self-organization without sacrificing individual
        autonomy and flexibility.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Regional
        policy must be designed to catalyze and coordinate rather than directly
        manage relations among the myriad public and private actors that
        populate a regional economy.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Industrial
        fragmentation, the source of flexibility in network systems, is also the
        source of its greatest vulnerability.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The dynamism of an industrial system based on regional networks
        depends crucially on institutions that transcend the interests of
        individual firms, industries, and political jurisdictions. It allows
        companies to respond jointly to shared challenges.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The
        decentralized industrial structure and strong territorial linkages of
        regional network-based system demand collective action at two levels.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>First, the specialist producers in network system must depend on
        the external provision of a wide range of collective services that
        spread risk and pool technological expertise.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Second, institutions that provide capital, research, managerial
        and technical education, training, assistance to entrepreneurs and
        market information must be set up.</font></p>
