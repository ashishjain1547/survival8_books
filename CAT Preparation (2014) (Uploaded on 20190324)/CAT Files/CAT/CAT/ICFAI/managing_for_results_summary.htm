        obtained by exploiting opportunities, not by solving problems.<span style="mso-spacerun:

        opportunities rather than to problems.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The best people must always be allocated to major opportunities,
        to the areas of greatest possible yields.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>And the best opportunities must always be staffed with people of
        superior ability and performance. The pertinent question is not how to
        do things right but how to find the right things to do, and to
        concentrate resources and efforts on them.&nbsp;<o:p>

        <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Economic

        </span>To be big is not identical with leadership.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The largest company is not necessarily the most profitable
        one, since it has to carry product lines, supply markets, or apply
        technologies where it cannot do a distinct, let alone a unique job. Any
        leadership position is transitory and likely to be short-lived.&nbsp;<o:p>

        </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">What exists is
        the product of yesterday. The business as it exists today reflects the
        decisions and actions taken in the past. The job is not to impose
        yesterday’s approach on a changed today; but to change the business,
        its behaviour, its attitudes, its expectations – as well as its
        products, its markets, and its distributive channels – to fit the new
        realities.</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;<o:p>

        <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">While 90 per
        cent of the results are being produced by 10 per cent of events, 90 per
        cent of the costs are incurred by the remaining and resultless 90 per
        cent of events.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Resources
        and efforts will normally allocate themselves to the 90 per cent of
        events that produce practically no results. Unless management constantly
        works at directing efforts into revenue generating activities, the costs
        will tend to allocate themselves by drifting into unproductive
        activities.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;Concentration
        is the key to economic results.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To
        achieve economic results, managers must concentrate their efforts on the
        smallest number of products, product lines, services, customers,
        markets, distributive channels, end-uses, and so on, that will produce
        the largest amount of revenue.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
        <p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="4" color="#004200">The

        <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Every business
        must identify and understand those areas in which results can be
        measured. This process requires business judgment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Defining the product is in itself a critical task.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>What is the main product and what is the accessory have to be
        carefully analysed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A
        business must produce efficiently. But there has to be a market for the
        product.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There also have to
        be distributive channels to get the product from the producer to the
        market.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The three must
        also be analyzed together and in their interrelationship. Indeed one of
        the most common causes of poor performance is imbalance between the
        three.<span style="mso-spacerun:

        dropped.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But it might be an
        excellent product offered to the wrong market or through the wrong
        distributive channel.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4" color="#004200"><b>Managing
        costs</b></font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Controlling
        costs is extremely important for any business. And focusing resources on
        results is the best and most effective cost control.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Cost is always incurred for the sake of a result.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>What matters therefore is not the absolute cost level but the
        ratio between efforts and their results.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>No matter how cheap or efficient an effort, it is waste, rather
        than cost, if it does not yield results.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Maximizing opportunities is the principal road to a high
        effort/result ratio and lower costs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>It must come first; other cost-control efforts are additional
        rather than central.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Effective
        control of costs requires examination of the whole business. Different
        costs must be treated differently.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Costs vary enormously in their character – as do products. Very
        often, the most effective way to cut costs is to cut out an activity
        together.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There is little
        point in trying to do cheaply what should not be done at all.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The cost system
        that needs to be analyzed is the entire economic activity which produces
        economic value. “Cost” should be defined as what the customer pays
        to obtain certain goods or services and to derive fully utility from
        them. What matters, to the customer, is total outlay.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The customer is not concerned with how the outlay is divided
        between a number of legally independent businesses in the economic chain
        from raw material to finished article.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>All he is concerned with is what he pays finally.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In fact, the
        definition of “costs” must go beyond customer purchases.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>No one buys a thing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
        buys the satisfaction and utility he derives therefrom.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>True economic costs therefore should include everything the
        customer has to spend to derive the full use from his purchase in
        maintenance, in repair, in running costs, and so on.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">There are
        various types of cost. Productive costs are the costs of efforts
        intended to provide the value the customer wants and is willing to pay
        for.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Cost of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>manufacturing, cost of promotion, cost of knowledge-work, cost of
        capital, cost of selling and cost of packaging are examples.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Support costs
        provide no value by themselves, but cannot be avoided. Policing costs
        are the costs of activities which do not aim at getting something done
        but at preventing the wrong things from happening. Waste is the cost of
        efforts that do not yield economic results.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Productive
        costs must be controlled through the concentration of resources on
        opportunities. They require “result control” rather than “cost
        control.” Their measurement is therefore always the productivity of
        the resources employed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Productive
        costs need to be measured in terms of the results obtained by the three
        key resources of men, time and money.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Support costs
        always have to prove first they are needed at all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>One must ask: “How much do we stand to lose if we do
        nothing?”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And if the
        answer is: “Less than the minimum cost of support,” then it is
        better to run the risk of an occasional loss and save the support costs.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Policing is
        best avoided.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The question
        is again: “Are we likely to lose more than it costs us to police?”
        If the answer is “No,” it is better not to police.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Even otherwise, policing should be restricted to a small but
        statistically valid sample, rather than every single event or
        transaction. Perhaps the best way of handling policing cost is to find
        an activity which has to be done anyhow and which yet controls and
        audits a great many areas that otherwise would have to be policed.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Waste rarely
        needs to be analyzed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But
        waste is often hard to find.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
        costs of not-doing tend to be hidden in the figures.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="4" color="#004200">Importance
        of customer focus</font></b></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Business is a
        process which converts a resource, a distinct knowledge, into a
        contribution of economic value in the market place.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The purpose of a business is to create a customer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>A business must provide something for which an independent
        outsider is willing to pay.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">What the people
        in the business think they know about customers and markets is more
        likely to be wrong than right.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Only
        by asking the customer, by watching him, by trying to understand his
        behavior can one find out who he is, what he does, how he buys, how he
        uses what he buys, what he expects, what he values, and so on.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The customer
        rarely buys what the business thinks it sells him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>One reason for this is that the customer does not pay for a
        “product” but for its satisfaction.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>But nobody can make or supply satisfaction. Only the means to
        attaining satisfaction can be sold and delivered.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A corollary is
        that the goods or services which the manufacturer sees as direct
        competition are often not the real competition.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Actually, the competition might be goods and services that look
        quite different, seem to serve entirely different functions, are made,
        distributed, sold differently – but are alternative means for the
        customer to obtain the same satisfaction.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Often, what the
        producer or supplier thinks is the most important feature of a product
        may well be relatively unimportant to the customer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>For the producer, quality is likely to be what is hard,
        difficult, and expensive to make. But the customer is not concerned
        about the manufacturer’s troubles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>His only question is: “What does this do for me?”</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Marketers must
        also pay adequate attention to people who are not their customers today.
        They must also ask. What do customers and non-customers buy from others?<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>And what value do these purposes have for them? What
        satisfaction do they give? Do they, indeed, actually or potentially
        compete with the satisfaction our products or services are offering?</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Attempting to
        understand seemingly irrational customer behaviour forces the
        manufacturer to adopt the marketing view rather than just paying lip
        service. It forces the manufacturer to take action according to the
        logic of the market rather than according to logic of the supplier.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>He must adapt himself to the customer’s behaviour or he must
        embark on the more difficult job of changing the customer’s habits and

        success, knowledge must first be meaningful to the customer in terms of
        satisfaction and value.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>By
        itself, knowledge is useless. It is only effective through the
        contribution it makes outside the business to customers, markets, and
        end-uses.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Economic
        results are the results of differentiation. The source of

        <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The best way to

        well-managed and competent businesses have had the opposite experience
        in similar undertakings. One can also compare one’s own failures with
