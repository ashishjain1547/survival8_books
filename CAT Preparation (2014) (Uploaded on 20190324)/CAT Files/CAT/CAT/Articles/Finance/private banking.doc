\par In recent times, private banking has emerged as the new solution by means of which banks attempt to reach out to their consumers in innovative and more meaningful ways. Private banking entails providing high net worth individuals with exceptional banking 
products and unsurpassed personal service. Dedicated relationship managers cater to the private banking customer\rquote s unique needs and preferences by reserving the cr\'e8me le da cr\'e8me of services for them. 
\par 
\par What are the special products and services being offered to these customers? How is private banking different from traditional banking?
\par 
\par What is in it for the bank? Does it provide a welcome alternative to corporate and retail banking where margins have been shrinking? Why are some banks still shying away fro
m private banking? What are the necessary skills and capabilities that a banker needs to develop? 
\par 
\par Will such a concept really pick up in India where individuals would rather rely on chartered accountants and personal friends for advice on how to manage their wealth? Would they attach any credibility to professional advice from a banker?
\par  
\par Moreover, with the threshold limit to become a private banking customer being anything between Rs 50 lakhs and Rs 3 crores, is there a viable market in the country? 
\par 
\par Wil
l banks be able to sustain the business in India given the highly regulated environment as compared to the overseas market where private banking literally translates into border less banking? Is there a future for online private banking, especially in the
 Indian context?
\par 
\par Finally, with banks increasingly garnering revenues from the \lquote niche\rquote  private banking services, what does this mean for the banking promise to touch every individual\rquote s life?
