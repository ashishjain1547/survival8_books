                        <P class=TITLE>How I Cracked CAT?</A> - Kalpana Bhat</P><!-- Inner Body Starts Here --><B>Name: Kalpana 
                        Bhat</B><BR><BR><B>My background:</B> Associate, JP 
                        Morgan Chase &amp; Co, San Francisco - 2000 to present 
                        <BR>PGDM IIM Ahmedabad 2000 <BR>B.Com Ethiraj College 
                        Chennai 1998 <BR><BR><BR><B>My Testing 
                        Experience</B><BR>I decided sometime during my 2nd year 
                        of college to give the CAT a shot. So, in May 1997, I 
                        borrowed the IMS material from a friend and started 
                        "preparing" for the tests. Like a good pupil, I started 
                        by following instructions and studying the material but 
                        I caught myself nodding off on more than one occasion. 
                        So, I decided to can it and dive right into the tests. 
                        That is when things got really interesting!! I took 
                        about 5 tests and never scored more than 70. That is 
                        enough to make you throw your hands up in despair and 
                        give up. But, I kept at it doggedly and trusted what 
                        people called the "learning curve". After about 10-12 
                        tests, I could safely infer : 
                        <UL>
                          <LI>what I was good at and what I needed to work on 
                          <LI>which questions to pursue and which ones to skip 
                          (for want of time) 
                          <LI>that it was time to retrieve my 10th and 11th std 
                          Math text books, dust it and give it the once-over 
                          <LI>that there is only one way to go and that's UP!!!! 
                          </LI></UL>To put all of the above in perspective - after 
                        the initial disappointment, <B>I did not miraculously 
                        grow a brain!!!</B> I just developed the ability to 
                        balance the little time I had and pick questions 
                        judiciously. It is crucial to know which questions to 
                        answer and which ones to re-visit IF you have time 
                        later!!! One is not fighting the familiar demons, like 
                        math or reading comprehension, but the break-neck speed 
                        at which the hands of time are flying! By Nov 1998, I 
                        had taken approx 40 tests. I also checked on the 
                        internet but unfortunately, there are very few resources 
                        offering CAT sample tests. But, GMAT will do. So, once 
                        you have exhausted your practice resources, use the 
                        sample link : <A 
                        href="http://www.800score.com/gmat-home.html">http://www.800score.com/gmat-home.html</A> 
                        Just keep practicing. Try doing at least one test a day 
                        leading up to the big day. <BR><BR><B>My CAT</B><BR>The 
                        year I tested (1997), the test was divided into 2 
                        portions. QA and DA were part of the first half and RC 
                        and VA were part of the second. We were given one hour 
                        for each portion. After the first hour, we were made to 
                        hand in our QA-DA section and then we received the RC-VA 
                        section. I think QA-DA had 85-90 questions and RC-VA had 
                        90-95 questions. For me, the DA and VA portions were 
                        reasonably challenging while the QA and RC sections were 
                        relatively easy. I focussed on attempting the maximum 
                        number of questions that I knew I had a shot at getting 
                        right. If a question was not of a familiar format or of 
                        a format that I knew would take time to solve, I kept it 
                        for later. This strategy works for me but it is 
                        important to determine what methods of filtering work 
                        for you. In Feb 1998, I found out I had calls from all 
                        but 1(Kozhikode) of the 6 IIMs. <BR><BR><B>My GD and 
                        Interview Experience</B><BR>I had not registered with 
                        IMS. So, I did not really have a lot of structured GD or 
                        interview preparation. I just trusted my luck and common 
                        sense. I filled out the form which has the "Why do you 
                        want to do an MBA", "Describe one incident where you 
                        took on a leadership role" questions honestly. Just be 
                        prepared to defend every word you state in that piece of 
                        paper. The interviews just whizzed by and I won't dwell 
                        on them too much. Suffice to say that the IIM-A GD and 
                        interview went really well. Both in the GD and the 
                        interview, I took strong stands and stuck to them. 
                        <BR><BR>The GD was a case study involving an army driver 
                        who decides to break the rule of not using official 
                        vehicles for personal purposes. After dropping off his 
                        commanding officer very late one night, he is very tired 
                        and takes the vehicle home. On the way home, he hits a 
                        child and kills him/her. He is obviously guilty of 
                        involuntary manslaughter but is he guilty of violating 
                        the army code of conduct? Should he be discharged? The 
                        case study gave rise to some interesting debate. At the 
                        end, we were asked to give a brief written synopsis of 
                        the GD. <BR><BR>The interview was very interesting too. 
                        A number of questions directed at me were either from my 
                        courses (accounting, mostly) or regarding my ethical 
                        values. When is the LIFO method of inventory valuation 
                        used? What would I do if I saw a corrupt politician in 
                        action vis-a-vis a third person? What would I do if I 
                        saw the same corrupt politician harming my own family? 
                        And more questions in that vein .... What the 
                        interviewers are looking for, both in the GD and 
                        interview are basically, honesty, strength of conviction 
                        and of course, at least a few correct answers! Don't ham 
                        when you don't know an answer. Just say you don't 
                        know!!! <BR><BR>In April 1998, I found out I had gotten 
                        into IIM-A. My 2 years at IIM-A were a roller-coaster 
                        ride.. But, I will go into that some other time 
                        ...<BR><BR>Until then, good luck and Godspeed!!!
