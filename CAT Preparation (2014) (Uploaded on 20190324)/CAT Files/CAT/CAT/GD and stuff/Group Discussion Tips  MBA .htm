                          <DT>GROUP DISCUSSION 
                          <DD>A group discussion (GD) is a simulated exercise, 
                          where you cannot suddenly put up a show, since the 
                          evaluators will see through you easily. In this page 
                          you can find tips on GD and how to handle them to 
                          ensure a positive outcome. <BR><BR>
                          <DT>Here's how most group discussions work: 
                          <DD>
                          <UL type=disc>
                            <LI>Normally groups of 8-10 candidates are formed 
                            into a leaderless group, and are given a specific 
                            situation to analyze and discuss within a given time 
                            limit. <BR>
                            <LI>The group may be given a case study and asked to 
                            come out with a solution for a problem. <BR>
                            <LI>The group may be given a topic and asked to 
                            discuss on the same. </LI></UL><BR>A panel will 
                          observe the proceedings and evaluate the members of 
                          the group. <BR><BR>
                          <DT>OBJECTIVE 
                          <DD>Lets start from the basic. One needs to know what 
                          one's objective in the group is. A good definition of 
                          your objective is - to be noticed to have contributed 
                          meaningfully in an attempt to help the group reach the 
                          right <A 
                          href="http://www.ascenteducation.com/india-mba/GD-PI/consensus.shtml"><B>consensus</B></A>. 
                          What does this essentially mean? <BR></DD></DL><BR>
                        <OL type=1>
                          <LI>The <B>first implication</B> is that <B>you should 
                          be noticed </B>by the panel. Merely making a 
                          meaningful contribution and helping the group arrive 
                          at a <A 
                          href="http://www.ascenteducation.com/india-mba/GD-PI/consensus.shtml"><B>consensus</B></A> 
                          is not enough. You have to be seen by the evaluating 
                          panel to have made the meaningful contribution. What 
                          does that mean in practice? 
                          <UL type=disc>
                            <LI>You must ensure that the group hears you. If the 
                            group hears you, so will the evaluator. That does 
                            not mean that you shout at the top of your voice and 
                            be noticed for the wrong reasons. 
                            <LI>You have to be assertive. If you are not a very 
                            assertive person you will have to simply learn to be 
                            assertive for those 15 minutes. Remember, 
                            assertiveness does not mean being bull-headed or 
                            being arrogant. 
                            <LI>And most importantly, you have to make your 
                            chances. Many group discussion participants often 
                            complain that they did not get a chance to speak. 
                            The fact is that in no group discussion will you get 
                            a chance to speak. There is nothing more 
                            unacceptable in a GD than keeping one's mouth shut 
                            or just murmuring things which are inaudible. 
                            <LI>Participate in as many practice GDs as possible 
                            before you attend the actual GD. There is nothing 
                            like practice to help you overcome the fear of 
                            talking in a GD. </LI></UL><BR>

                            succeed in a group discussion is by speaking loudly 
                            and at great length. One could not be more wrong.

                              then it makes sense to take the alternate approach 
                              and oppose the topic even if you initially 
                              intended to talk for the topic.
