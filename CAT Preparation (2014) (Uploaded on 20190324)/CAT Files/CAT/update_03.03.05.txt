hi
 This is my contribution to the 'news' initiative that was taken up 
by you As I had promised to volunteer for the Science(space) 
section , following is  the article.
As this is the first article ,I have added an introduction to it . 
----------------article starts from below-----------
 
"The Next Frontier"
   Historically there were many steps in human evolution. 
Probably the first step was when man started walking on his two 
feet. The change in man from being a hunter and a gatherer to a 
farmer was  another of those steps.
   From then on the invention of the wheel , the  steam engine, 
electricity, the telephone, the  micro-controller, the Internet, all 
these were steps  that marked the further evolution of modern 
human being, into the most dominant species on this earth.
   Furthermore it was man's desire to explore and adapt that 
ensured that he survived the many ice ages and  nature's 
vagaries. And now as we move forward into the  future ,we need 
new regions to explore , and those  next frontiers are in -- 
SPACE.
   This month we saw
