URPERCENTILE WRITES :  
TIPS FOR QUANTS: Most important part is to understand your 
weaknesses and strong areas. When you have limited time first 
attempt the questions you are strong at.
When you get a question wrong analyse it and try to understand 
why you got it wrong . The most likely reason are :
1. Lack of knowledge
2. Lack of practise 
3. Silly Mistake.

If it is due to lack of knowledge you need to go back and start 
working on fundamentals. When it is due to lack of practice you 
need to solve more questions of similar type.  Notice the trend of 
your silly mistakes. People tend to repeat the same silly 
mistakes over and again. Be cautious when you are solving a 
question where you tend to commit a silly mistake.

When attempting a MOCK test, don't get bogged down on any 
particular question. If you are not able to solve any particular 
question within a minute just leave it and move to the next 
question. Don't let your ego force you to stay on that particular 
question that you are not able to solve quickly. Read the 
questions properly, if you feel that you can solve it, then go ahead 
and solve it , otherwise just leave it and move to the next one. 
The ability to judge, if a question is to be solved or to be left will 
come with more practice. Practice more, try to solve as many 
questions as possible, from diverse sources.
