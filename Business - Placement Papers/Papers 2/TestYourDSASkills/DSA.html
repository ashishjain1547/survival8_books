How can I sort a linked list?
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Sometimes it's easier to keep the list in order as you build it (or
perhaps to use a tree instead). Algorithms like insertion sort and merge
sort lend
<br>themselves ideally to use with linked lists. If you want to use a standard
library function, you can allocate a temporary array of pointers, fill
it in with
<br>pointers to all your list nodes, call qsort, and finally rebuild the
list pointers based on the sorted array.
