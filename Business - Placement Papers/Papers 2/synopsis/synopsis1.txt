1. The grammer for A, B, S is given below.
S->Ax|By
A->Ax|y
B->x|y
possible ans is xy|xy 
2. In n*n matrix , there non zero numbers in diagonal and either side
of the diagonal. If represented in one dimensional array, assign the
values which are non zeros.
find relation with i,j iteration and linear arry
like a[2*(i-1)+j] this 
the matrix will be
x x 0 0 0 0 --------
x x x 0 0 0 0 -----
0 x x x 0 0 0  ------
0 0 x x x 0 0  -------
0 0 0 x x x 0 0 ----

remumber n*n matrix
3. In-order of the letters is given as below:
If written in pre-order like given below:
write the post-order:
4. fun(n)
   {
    if(n<=2)
    return (1);
    else 
     return ((fun(n-1)*fun(n-2));
     }
find the order of complexity of the programme.
possible answer ---- N(2^n)
5. 


6. If a and b are given. write the results of the programme 
given below. 
  a=a XOR b;
  b=a XOR b;
  a= a XOR b;
answer is  swaping of a and b
 so b,a is answer
7.
8.for a given CMOS the voltage is halved
 freqency doubled
 capacitance halved
what is the present CMOS power
ans (b)----   dynamic power is 1/2 *C*f*V^2
9.if a row daminated two dimentional arry in the following which one is advantage
and why?
a) for(i=0;i<1000;i++)
     for(j=0;j<1000;j++)
           temp=temp+a[i][j];
b) for(j=0;j<1000;j++)
    for(i=0;i<1000;i++)
         temp=temp+a[i][j]
I donot know ans
10. what is area of a Hexagon with side as 1unit
ans is 3*(sqrt(3))/2
11. If traverse in a chess board right and down from one corner to  another corner
 how many possible ways will be there
ans is C(16,8) or (16!/(8!*8!))
12. Tick the below which can biparate (graph theory)
1)tree 2)forest of trees 3) evencycle graph 4) oddcycle graph 
ans is 1,2,3
13.The fig shown in below is a SRAM (1K* 4 bits) ,how many of this SRAMS are
reqired to design 16K of one byte 
ans is  32 SRAMS and one 4 to 16 decoder
14. suppose two persons entering into one room in the morning 5 to 6 A.M. 
what is the probability they will enter in 10 minits gap.
 I donot know this answer
15. In a binary tree what is the hight and lowest no of levels for N nodes.
ans is  highest is N and lowest is log(N+1) base 2  
16.represent 3 and -3 in base -2 form taking two states (0,1) only
i do not know the ans
