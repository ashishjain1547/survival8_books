                I2 PAPER (IIT kanpur)      14/8/98

                        
IN THIS THERE ARE TWO PAPERS EACH OF ONE HOUR.ONE IS ANALYTICAL
AND THE OTHER IS TECHNIQAL PAPER.

ANALYTICAL PAPER: IN THIS THERE ARE 3 PARTS
        
        PART A: THERE ARE ABOUT 45 QUESTIONS.IN EACH THERE ARE 
        TWO SENTENCES.YOU HAVE TO SELECT THE TRUE STATEMENT.

        FOR EXAMPLE--1
        1.LUCK PLAYS GREAT ROLE TO GET SUCCESS
        2.IF WE WORK HARD WE GET SUCCESS.
        
        while answering these questions you should be careful because
        many questions will be repeated ie., one question will be
        asked in different ways.so your response should be same for 
        all that questions.

        PART B: IN THIS THERE ARE ABOUT 4 SECTIONS. IN EACH SECTION 
        THERE ARE 15 BITS.
        SECTION 1---
        SECTION 2--- INFERENCES, 
        SECTION 3--- CONCLUSIONS
        SECTION 4--- ASSUMPTIONS

        PART C: THERE IS NEGATIVE MARKING IN THIS PART.THIS IS 
        COMPREHENSIVE.THERE ARE 10 QUESTIONS.

************************************************************************
  (I am unable to reproduce questions as itis. iam writing them
   in my own words questions are same just language different)

  TECHNICAL PAPER ::  IN THIS THERE ARE TWO PARTS
                
        PART 1: THERE ARE 20 MULTIPLE CHOICE QUESTIONS .EACH QUESTION
        CARRIES 3 MARKS.THERE IS NEGATIVE MARKING FOR EACH WRONG ANSWER
        MINUS 1 MARK.HERE ARE SOME QUESTIONS OF THIS PART.

  3. in 32 bit memory machine 24 bits for mantissa and 8 bits for 
     exponent. to increase the range of floating point.
     a) more than 32 bit is to be there.
     b) increase 1 bit for mantissa and decrease 1 bit for exponent
     c) increase 1 bit for exponent and decrease one bit for mantissa
     d)

  4. this on logical gates

        PART 2:
                HERE A PROBLEM IS DEFINED YOU HAVE TO WRITE A
                PROGRAMME IN C OR C++

        TWO SCHOOLS,HAVING DIFFERENT NO. OF CLASSES . EACH CLASS HAS 
        DIFFERENT NO. OF SECTIONS.THE 2 SCHOOLS HAVE TO BE MERGED 
        TOGETHR SO THAT A STUDENT OF SAME CLASS AND SECTION REMAIN
        SAME. FOR EXAMPLE, 1A STUDENTS OF BOTH SCHOOLS SHOULD BE IN 1A
        SECTION OF NEW SCHOOL

        WRITE A PROGRAM FOR THE ABOVE USING
        1) DYNAMIC MEMORY ALLOCATION
        2) SRUCTURES
        3)




************************************************************************
        


        in iitk about 400 students attended for written test and
        only 18 students were shortlisted .  after interview they 
        have selected only 8 students ( 1 from mtech and 7 from btech)


                       BEST OF LUCK

                        ---- 
one to one negative marking is there.it is tough to qualify
unless u know the paper.totally there are 105 questions. 70 min. three
flow sheets---- 10 min. sections are quantitative(23),analytical(about
20)  ,series&venn diagrams,logical(20) questions from a passage (about
10). time span for each section is different.sit at the back so that u 
can turn pages if u want.different colored papers
 are used.  for flow sheets first one is relatively easy
 1.u will be given conditions like
   if a wins he gets 100 pts,if b wins he gets 50 pts etc
 2.there is flow sheet& there are empty cells(4) at "yes' or 'no" 
decision
points. 
 3.for each cell 4 choices will be given which should be chosen by
following through initial conditions &flow sheet logic. 
4.rem. -ve marking is there.  no verbal questions. 

rs aggarwals verbal& nonverbal book verbal--- pg. 254 pr. 53 
to56(almost same) 246 eg.2 pg 104 exer.3a about 5to 6 series 
qu.are there.so do well
 pg.354-355 8,13,
                   6th doubt 4 conclusions r there in all ques. 
pg.115----qu.36 nonverbal----pg.5 41,54,108,145,158 241 is doubtful
--------------- ans. to one quant. is 200/3 %

anals
 1.six persons will be there. 
 killer,victim,hangman,judge,police,vitness
  a,b, c,d,e,f u have to match conditions like,a is the last person to 
the
victim alive,will be given as clues.so we can conclude that a is the
killer. this is an easy one .paragraph will be very big .don' worry 5 
to 6
ques. 2. 5 persons will be there. cashier,
A
clerk,buyer,manager,floorwalker(check in info. paper for exact ques.) 
a,b,c,d,e will be their names. conditions will be given&we have to 
match
who is who 3 r women&2 r men in this sample condition, cashier&clerk if
get married, b will be wise man mrs.c husband has some business prob 
with
manager manager&cashier(or clerk) r classmates etc. will be given

do quantitative qu. from back. 

data graphs on turnover,gross profit &net profit will be given& u have
extract data from that &find out few ratios.(easy one)

                        ARTHAMATIC SECTION
 (1) if a boat is moving in upstream with v1 km/hr and in the down stream
 it is moving with v2 km/hr then what is the speed of the stream.
 ans:  13 check the values of v1 and v2 are given
 to find ans (v+s = v1, v-s = v2 find the boat velocity)

 (2)     0.75 * 0.75 * 0.75 - 0.001
       --------------------------------
         0.75*0.75-0.075+0.01

  (3)   A can work done   in 8 days 
        B can work three timesfaster than the A;
        C can work five times faster asthe A;
        ans : 8/9 it is correct place blindly.

 (4)    one answer is 200/3 % it is perfectly correct i cannot recollect
        the prob. so place it blindly.
        
  (5)  A car is journied a certain distance in 7 hrs in forward journey
  in the return journey increased speed 12km/hr takes the times 5 hrs.
  what is the distance        ans:210 it is perfect place blindly.
  
  (6) instead of multiplying  by 7 to a number dividing by 7 what is 
  the percentage of error 
  ans we dont know but he has gived 14 18 25 andsome answers less than

(7) x + 4 y 
   ---------  relation between x and y is x/2y = 3/2 ie x = 3y find the 
    x -  2y     ratio ans: 7 place it blindly.
    
(8) a man buy a liquid  by 12 lts  and the mixture is of 20% liquid in water

    note: the values of A and B may slitely vary be ware.
    
(11) on an item a company gave 25% discount then they get 25% profit 
      if it gives 10% discount then what is the profit.
 ans: 30% it is correct place blindly.
 
(12) 
  
i will send the remaining problems if i get remembered o.k this section 
contain 29 questions.

in fourth section.
1. All chairs laugh.
 some birds laugh.

2. some green are blue 
no blue is white.


3 all scientists are fools.
all fools are literates.
only these questions see rs agarwal reasoning verbal and nonverbal book
new edition asthe page numbers i already sended to you.
ansers he changed slitely see.

From two fig 6 questions regarding the swimmers,girls,tennisplayers,tall and
second one on politicians,graduates,parliament members, both questions
are same given so mugup and go to exam and place blindly i already
sended the page numbers in previous mail.

series:(1) R,M,(..),F,D,(..)
  ans: I,C
(2) (...),ayw,gec,mki,sqo   ans: usq.
(3)  1,3,4,8,15,27,   ans:  50
(4)  0,2,3,5,8,10,15,17,24,26,..     ans: 35
(5)   2,5,9,19,37,..      ans:75

these are the correct ansers place it blindly.

the figure series which i had already send in the earlier paper is
same and one extra qestion is their it is this type
    box type in side the box line and dot. 
this type  see in the new edition rs agerwal a box is their 
in the answer so try for question in rs agerwal 
                          
see rs agerwal for statements and assemptions questions.

As per my experience I attempted only 32 questions out of 105
and i was topper among the 35 who shortlisted for interview.
In IITD also the same thing was happened.
cut off will be around 30 out of 105.
the above 35 questions aare enough to qualify.
remaining questions if u know exact answers then place .
otherwise simply leave it.
