	code was something similar to Bubble sort and that
particular code does the sorting in Desending order and the complexity
is O(n^2)(which is the next question).

20. Real Time Os should have 
   a)fast context switch

1 bit of stopping data is to be transferred. what should be done.
     options were like 
	 a) send directly
	 b) send after encoding 
		  etc.
22. There are three processes A, B, C. A sends data to B. B removes the
header stores it and sends the data to C. C returns it to B. B receives the
message, identifies the message and adds the header that was stored and 
sends to A.B receives the messages from C such that atmost 'm' messages  
B
are pending.
     Identify the best Data Structure.

23.  A question in compiler about the heap and stack allocation of memory.

24.  struct
