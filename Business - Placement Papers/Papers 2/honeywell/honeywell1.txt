     HONEYWELL 

Here is the questions that was asked to one of my ms friends in
last years campus interview (Honeywell).
This was not included in the database in ~mrb.
/***************************************************************/
Hi MRB,
		I am out of placement after getting selection in Honeywell,
which was my dream job.

Honeywell conducted a test in IIT and Interview was in their
office at B'lore.

Test contained 100 multiple choice questions divided into

		a) Verbal ability  (15 ques)
		b) Numerical aptitude (15 )
		c) Logical and analytical ability (15)
		d) Elementary computer science (10)
		d) Programming langauages (20)
		e) Operatins systems and Data structures (25)

Not sure about the number of questions.

Verbal ability questions contained 3 parts. 
a) One passage is given and U have to answer 5 questions
b) Some words are given and their synonyms have to be written
c) 

Numerical aptitude and Logical questions were the usual stuff.
---------------------------------------------------------------
I had 4 rounds of interview.
First round (around 45 minutes) contained, questions from Real-time
-----------
Systems (my research area), operating systems and Software Engineering

Explain U'r research work.

What is a Real-Time System ?
What is the difference between Hard and Soft real-time systems ?
What is a mission critical system ?
What is the important aspect of a real-time system ?

Explain the difference between microkernel and macro kernel.
Give an example of microkernel.
Why paging is used ?
Which is the best page replacement algo and Why ?

WHat is software life cycle ?
How much time is spent usually in each phases  and why ?
Which one do U want to work if selected in Honeywell ?
( I said I don't like testing )
They asked why ? 
I said it is a boring job. Then they tried to analyse
the knowledge in testing.

What is testing ?
Which are the different types of testing ?
Then they explained the way they do testing. They said that they are
doing testing in requirement phase and design phase so that if any
problem comes in those phases it is not ncecessary to go back and change
the requirement or design. All the test processing is automated.

Why do U want to join Honeywell ?
Ans : To get a practical feeling of Real-time systems. 

Do U know C++ ?
How good are U in C and C++ ?
Rate U'rslef in both C and C++. ( 1 - 10 marks)

Second round (around 45 minutes ) 
------------
They wanted a bio-data at the time of inteview. I gave the placement
office bio-data and in that one there was column 'Major subjects
studied'. Many of the questions came from those.

Explain U'r research work.
Lot of questions from it.

What is a distributed system ?
Some questions about CSP. ( I kept quiet)
Which languages do U know ?
What are the differences between Pascal and C.
I said Pascal is a strongly typed language.
Then what is typing  and its advantages ?
Then he asked some questions from Compiler construction and Lisp.

WHich are the different computer architectures ?
What is the requirement in MIMD ?
What is the difference between RISC and CISC processors ?
Difference between loosely coupled and tightly coupled systems ?
What is an open system ?

Still a lot of questions from software engineering .
Which are the different phases in Software life cycle (asked again)
Why is analysis and testing phases very important ?
Which methodologies are U familiar with ?

Have U worked in windows ? (Yes)
What is the difference U have seen from a Dos environment ?
I said it event driven .
So what do U mean by event driven ?
How do WinMain look like ?
How the messages are processed in Windows ?
(Queue of events)
What are parameters needed to distinguish an event ?

Have U done any network programming ?
Why networks are layered ?
What is the advantage of that ?
How many layers are there in OSI ?
WHy is it called OSI model ?
Are U familiar with network topologies ?
Which are the different network toplogies ?
Tell an example of bus type network.
I said ethernet.
What is the Bandwidth of ethernet ?
Explain the advantage and disadvantage of ethernet ?
Which is the protocol used in ethernet. (CSMA/CD)
Why is it called so ?
If all stations tries to communicate at same time, what will happen.
What is binary exponential backoff algo ?

What is the advantage of Ring network ?
Compare it with ethernet.
In a real-time system which one do U prefer and why ?
What is the basic requirement of a real-time network ?
Which one is costly - ethernet of ring networks ?

Some questions form OOSD and Digital signal processing.
What is inheritance, encapsulation etc.

Third Round (15 minutes)
-----------
Asked about the percentages and marks during SSC, PDC, B.Tech and MS.
When can U join ?
Who is U'r guide ?
U are from which place ?
Where is it in Kerala ?
How do U perform in the first two interviews ?
WHy have U given Honeywell as dream job ?
Some more personal questions

Fourth Round (45 minutes)
------------
What do U like in Bangalore ?
I said the weather and all my friends are here.
Asked about my family members.
How do  U interact with friends ?
How do adjust to a new environemnt ?
Suppose U solve a problem and after that U are getting an almost same
problem with high complexity ( and lower complexity). How will U
approach to the next problem. 
What is U'r approach towards a new subject ?
How do U prepare for exams ?
Suppose in a project meeting, somebody fires U, how will U react ?
Are U patient enought to wait in long queues ?
Still some more which I don't rememebr.....


VERIFONE

Verifone test Questions :

There are two parts :
Note: The Answers given here are what i wrote, May not be correct.

1. Aptitute test 	:  15 Minutes, 20 Questions

	Towards the middle questions are easy than from the front.

	eg.  Product of three consecutive nos. 210.  What is the sum
	   	of two least numbers?
		ans.: 5 * 6 * 7 = 210 , sum = 11 is answer

	eg.  If the area of the sqaure is increased by 69 % how
		much the length of the side will increase?

		  ans.: 13 (i think)
	eg.  if the sum of five consecutive nos. 35? how many prime nos
		are there :
		 
		ans: 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 35  so two primes

	eg.  if the length of the rectangle is reduced by 20% and breath
		is increased by 20 % what is the net change ?
		ans.: 4 % decrease
