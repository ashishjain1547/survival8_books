  (d)_____________
15  main()
      {
        char *s;
         s="hot java";
        strcpy(s,"solarrs java")
      }
16 main()
  {
   printf("hot java");
   fork()  
   exit(0);
  }
  1. when redirected to a sreen what will be printed.
  2 when redirected to file what will be printed.
17.main()
    {
     int ret;
     ret=fork();ret=fork();ret=fork();ret=fork();
     if(!ret)
     printf("sun");
     else
     printf("solaris");
  how many sun 4 solaris will get printed
18. main()
      {
        char *p='a';
        int *i=100/*p;
     }
  what will be the value of *i= 1
                                1.03
                                cannot be defined.
19 which data structure gives efficient search
    1 B-tree
    2 binary tree
    3 array
    4 linked list
20. struct point
           {
            struct point *next;
            int data;
           }x;
    main()
       {
        int i;
        for(x=p;x!=0;)
        x=x->next,x++;
      freelist(x);
      }       
         freelist(x)
           {
            free(x);
            return
         }
    find error?
21. mutex and _________are similar locking mechanisms.
