Subject: easy-tech

       Hai guys,
               Atlast it came to an end in GSSL.I couldn't qualify in
written test.Actually I could have qualified in written test.But I made
a big mistake by giving the gssl paper to allof my friends.It had resulted
in the rapid spreading of the paper throughout the hostel making everybody
aware of the questions that were going to come in the exam.And surprising-
ly the gssl had given us the same question paper.Had I have not given the
paper to all I would have certainly qualified in the written test.Anyway,
I am not blaming myself for it.Whatever has happened I am not going to 
dug into it.
             On 23rd TCS will be testing us.Here I am sending the paper of
Easy-Tech.I don't know when it is coming here.Sarva, you had once mention-
ed in your mail that easy-tech is coming to your campus.Best of luck for
your campus interviews.Be prepare well.
                    Reply soon 
                                               yours lovingly,
                                                  dvnrao

1]. The following variable is available in file1.c

 
static int average_float;

        all the functions in the file1.c can access the variable


[2]. extern int x;

        Check the answer

[3]. Another Problem with 

        # define TRUE 0

        some code

        while(TRUE)
        {
                some code 

        }
        

        This won't go into the loop as TRUE is defined as 0


[4].   A question in structures where the memebers are dd,mm,yy.

        mm:dd:yy
        09:07:97

[5]. Another structure question         

        1 Rajiv System Analyst

[6].    INFILE.DAT is copied to OUTFILE.DAT


[7]. A question with argc and argv . 

        Input will be

        c:\TEMP.EXE Ramco Systems India

			on this only I got job.One more thing is
			CLASS,INHERATENCI&POLYMORPHISM is sufficient)

		  THAT AS YOUR OWN WORK(This will increase chance
			to 99%)

          OK HARI 3 MORE QUES ARE THERE.I HOPE YOU CAN SOLVE EASILY.
            NOW I have only 3 C ques. I am sendins them in immediate

	C QUESTIONS:WHAT IS THE OUT PUT FOR FOLLOWING 

PROGRAMMS

1)
main()
{
char a[2];
*a[0]=7;
*a[1]=5;
printf("%d",&a[1]-a)
ANS:

   ans may be 1.(illegal initialization)

2)
#include<stdio.h>
main(){
char a[]="hellow";
char *b="hellow";
char c[5]="hellow";
printf("%s %s %s ",a,b,c);
printf(" ",sizeof(a),sizeof(b),sizeof(c));
}

(ans is     hellow,hellow,hellow
              6,2,5   )

3)
#include<stdio.h>
main()

float value=10.00;
printf("%g %0.2g %0.4g %f",value,value,value,value)
}

(ans is 10,10,10,10.000000)

4)
#include<stdio.h>
void function1;
int i-value=100;
main()
{
 i-value=50;
function1;
printf("i-value in the function=",i-value);
printf("i-value after the function=",i-value);
}
printf("i-value at the end of main=",i-value);
functioni()
i-value=25;


THIS IS ROUGH IDEA OF THE PROGRAM
   ANS ARE
1)i-value in the function=25;
2)i-value after the function=50;
3)i-value at the end of the main=100;

5)
  main()
{
funct(int n);
{
switch(n)
  case1:
        m=2;
  		break;
  case2:
	m=5;
		break;
  case3:
	m=7;
		break;
  default: 
	m=0;
}

THIS IS ROUGH IDEA:
    (ANS:Out put is m=0) 

REMAINING 5 PROGRAMS SOME WHAT LARGE AND COMPLICATED.ANY WHEY
I WILL SEND REMAINING PROGRAMS BEFORE 20th.
