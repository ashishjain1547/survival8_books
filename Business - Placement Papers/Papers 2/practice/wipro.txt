Dear Freinds, 
           The below is Wipro Paper held at I.S.I-CALCUTTA 
On 02/08/99. 
           Read On..... 

  
   
   There are 20 questions . Each 3 marks. -1 for wrong answer. 

   1)How many NAND gates are required to implement an OR-gate? 
   ans  3 

   2)There is one Karnaugh map. asked to write the Boolean expresion. 
   ans is   xyz'+xy'z+x'yz 

   3)They have given one   D-flip flops circuit and asked to find the 
   function. 
   ans is shift Register. 

   4)There are 16 address lines and the page size is .5Mbytes .Then How
many 
   pages are there in Virtual memory. 
   ans is 128 

   5) There are 3 Interupts .the processor takes 5ns to serve the
request. 
   Interupt 11 takes 24.5ns   High Priority 
   12 takes 
   13 takes 20ns    Low Priority 

      What is the time range to complete the Interupt 13. 
      ans is 29.5    to 93.5 


   6) One question on 8085 address lines. 
   ans : 8 lines    bidirection 

   7)    One question on automata .Given the graph and asked to finnd the 

   regular expression 
   ans: (aab+ba) (bab)* 

   10)Another  question on automata.   a/ba* indicates 
   Ans: 
   the strings which contains   either one "a"  or   a " b" followed by
zero 
   or 
   more "a"  s. 

   11) 
   One question on LR pass of compiler. 

   12) 
   Binary equialent of 10.625 

   ans:1010.101 

   13) 
   In which addressing mode Effective address  is computed by adding a 
   constant to a register. 

   ans: Indexed mode 

   14) 
   Files (sequential)f1 ,f2,f3,f4,f5,f6   are having
100,200,70,40,250,50 
   Bytes respectively.In which order the access time is minimum if you
are 
   asked to get all the files. 

   15) 

   16) 
   -20)    on c language   mainly on pointers. 


  
   
   This is the entire paper. The cut off mark is 25. They selected   16
for 
   Interiew and selected 7. 

They are asking O.sys ,Networks, data structures   and giving c problems
on 
pointers(How to reverse a linked list  ..etc). 

  
   
   Wish u all the best.
