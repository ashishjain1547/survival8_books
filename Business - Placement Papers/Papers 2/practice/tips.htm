Fred (not his real name) saw this page <i>before</i>

going to his interview at Microsoft. He contacted me about

potential answers to these questions as well as other things he

should do to prepare. He also acted as my own personal mole.

Here's some interview tips that Fred got from Human Resources

over the phone:

<p>



<blockquote>

    &quot;I am expected to arrive at Microsoft

    recruiting (building 19) by 10:15AM. At that time, I will

    meet with my recruiter and present my application for

    employment. We'll go over any concerns or questions I have

    and then we'll head to the first interview.



    I am interviewing for a Software

    Design Engineer position, probably in the Interactive Media

    division. The interviewers will consist mainly of SDEs.<p>



    Some interviewers carry more sway

    than others. I may encounter a particularly important

    interviewer at any time during the day. The interviewers are

    looking for someone who shows enthusiasm for working at

    Microsoft. They also want someone who will be thoughtful

    before answering questions or writing code. Lack of sustained

    enthusiasm and lack of aforethought are the two biggest weed

    out factors.<p>



    The interviewers will grill me to get

    at my technical abilities. I will be asked a lot of questions

    about coding in general. I may write in the computer

    programming language which I find most comfortable. I may

    choose whichever language is best suited to solving a given

    problem. I will also be asked some basic questions about

    project scheduling and personnel management. The interviewers

    want some idea of how I would interact with people on a team,

    possibly as a leader or Program Manager.<p>



    I am free to arrive early and enjoy

    the cafeteria. The person I spoke with this morning said that

    I could call when I arrive and we could get some coffee or

    something beforehand. There is no expected dress, but jeans

    are out. I will be wearing a gray suit with a sporty tie.

    There will be time for lunch (good, I'll need it!).&quot;<p>

Here's some more tips from another Fred (also not his real name):

<p>



<blockquote>

    &quot;Interviewers are usually fluent in

    many computer languages, so you can choose C or C++ (by far

    the most prevalent), BASIC, or any other language. Of course,

    if you claim C++ knowledge, you should implement your

    algorithms in C++.<p>



    Also, don't claim to be a 10 out of

    10 on interviews. There'll always be an 11 out of 10 there --

    it's Microsoft, remember. And if you don't know C++ or some

    other thing, say so. Don't try to fake it, cause you won't be

    able to.<p>



    For test positions, emphasis is on

    developing an algorithm, and then telling the interviewer

    about how you'd test it (e.g. give illegal input [which?,

    how?], call the function in low-memory conditions,

    double-byte character set implications, etc.).&quot;<p>

</blockquote>

Here's some tips from Matthew Wetmore (his real name!):</p>



<blockquote>

    &quot;The interview times will vary from

    candidate to candidate. After the recruiter, you're

    interviewing directly with the people you might be working

    with, so the scheduling can get a little wacky fitting in

    with their group commitments, meetings, and so on. On that

    note, you will spend the day interviewing with people of the

    same job description. If you're expecting to be an SDE, and

    you're interviewing with PM's, there's probably something

    wrong. Also, make sure it's absolutely clear right from the

    start with HR what you want to do. There is really no way to

    shift the emphasis on the day of the interview, and if you

    try the interviewers will feel like they're wasting their

    time.<p>



    As far as dress code for the

    interviews, there's no hard rule. It totally depends on who

    you're interviewing with. If you're going to wear a suit,

    make sure it's something you're comfortable in. I interview

    SDE's, and I really don't care what a candidate wears, short

    of something really distracting (a grizzled bit-twiddler in a

    pink tutu might prove a *little* disconcerting). PM's tend to

    be a bit fancier, since they deal with the public a whole lot

    more than a tester or a developer does. But as I said, go

    with something you're going to be comfortable thinking

    in.&quot;<p>
