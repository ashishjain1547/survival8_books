system concepts:

1.int a[5,6]
  how much memory will be allocated
2.char p[6];
  char *d[10];
  ans:d=(char*)p
3.using LFU algorithm,how many page faults will occur of the pages r
  1,2,1,3,4.
  ans:1,4
4.in which layer the bridges r used.
  a)data link layer
  b)session layer
  c)physical layer
  d)network layer
5.#define d 10+10
  main()
  { printf("%d",d*d);
  }
6.in a complete binary tree if the number of levels r 4 then the number of
  nodes will be,
7.if we delete a node from a balanced binary tree,how can we retain the
  properties of balanced binary tree.
  ans: by rotation at the nodes.
8.in a k-way search tree with N keys, the number of node/no. of leaves=
9.s->A0B
  A->BB|1
  B->AA|0
  how many string can be constructed with length 5.
10.in which of the following regular expression the srting contains
   atleast 2 concetive 1's.
   ans:(0+10)*||(0+1)*
11.int i,j=1;
   for(i=0;i<10;i++);
    { 
      j=j+1;
    }
   printf("%d %d",i,j);
   
   ans:10 11
12.static char *i;
   i=malloc(sizeof(char));
   find the error;
   ans:malloc returns void
13.virtual memory address capacity depends on--
14.main()
  { int i=1;
    fork();
    fork();
    fork();
    printf("%d",i);
  }
  how many times i will be printed
  ans:8
15.question on threads
16.int i=0xaa
   char *p;
   p=(char *)i;
   p=p>>4;
   printf("%x",p);
   ans:0x000000a;
17.union
   { char *p;
     int i;
     char b;
   }
   main()
   { 
       --
    p=(char*)malloc(8*sizeof(char));
  }
  what is the size of union?
18.enum{sunday=-1,monday,...saturday}
   printf("%d %d",sizeof(wednesday),wednesday);
19.struct x{
      struct{
         struct{
            char ch;
             } x;
         }};
  ans:definition wrong
20.struct *s;
   s=(struct *)malloc(10*sizeof(struct)+90*sizeof(int));
   free(s);
   ans:total memory deallocated
21.one alogrithm is given:
  ans:10395 
22.func()
   { int x=1;
     if(x=1)
        x=1000;
     else
        x=10;
    
     return x;
    }
   what is the return value?
   ans:1000
