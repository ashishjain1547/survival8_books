<H2>	INTERVIEW QUESTION BANK</H2>

<P>
For the LATEST version refer <A

<HR>
<P>
Here is a set of questions that I have with me which software guys
have asked at interviews in the past, most of them are actually from
Microsoft but a few have been pulled together from other places too.
Sadly the solutions are not listed here but you could try and discuss
them with your friends. If someone is willing to send me the solutions
(a good number, not just one) then I can add them to this page. I have
collected these from friends and would welcome any additions from you.
Mail them to <A HREF="mailto:kiran@usc.edu">kiran@usc.edu</A>

<P>
<A HREF="#appqs">Go here for some questions specific to Application
Programming</A>(VB, VBScript, HTML, ASP, ADO etc.) <BR>
<P>

<PRE>

 1. Given a rectangular (cuboidal for the puritans) cake with a rectangular
    piece removed (any size or orientation), how would you cut the remainder
    of the cake into two equal halves with one straight cut of a knife ?
 
 2. You're given an array containing both positive and negative integers and
    required to find the subarray with the largest sum (O(N) a la KBL).  
    Write a routine in C for the above.
 
 3. Given an array of size N in which every number is between 1 and N, 
    determine if there are any duplicates in it.  You are allowed to destroy
    the array if you like. [ I ended up giving about 4 or 5 different solutions 
    for this, each supposedly better than the others ].
 
 4. Write a routine to draw a circle (x ** 2 + y ** 2 = r ** 2) without making
    use of any floating point computations at all.  [ This one had me stuck for
    quite some time and I first gave a solution that did have floating point
    computations ].
 
 5. Given only putchar (no sprintf, itoa, etc.) write a routine putlong that
    prints out an unsigned long in decimal.  [ I gave the obvious solution of
    taking % 10 and / 10, which gives us the decimal value in reverse order.  
    This requires an array since we need to print it out in the correct order.
    The interviewer wasn't too pleased and asked me to give a solution which
    didn't need the array ].
 
 6. Give a one-line C expression to test whether a number is a power of
    2. [No loops allowed - it's a simple test.]
 
 7. Given an array of characters which form a sentence of words, give an
    efficient algorithm to reverse the order of the words (not characters)
    in it.
 
 8. How many points are there on the globe where by walking one mile south,
    one mile east and one mile north you reach the place where you started.

 9. Give a very good method to count the number of ones in a 32 bit number.
    (caution: looping through testing each bit is not a solution).

 10. What are the different ways to say, the value of x can be either a 0
     or a 1. Apparently the if then else solution has a jump when written
     out in assembly. 
	if (x == 0)
		y=0
	else 
		y =x    

	There is a logical, arithmetic and a datastructure soln to the above
	problem.

 11. Reverse a linked list.
 
 12. Insert in a sorted list
 
 13. In a X's and 0's game (i.e. TIC TAC TOE) if you write a program for
     this give a gast way to generate the moves by the computer. I mean this
     should be the fasteset way possible. The answer is that you need to store
     all possible configurations of the board and the move that is associated
     with that. Then it boils down to just accessing the right element and
     getting the corresponding move for it. Do some analysis and do some more
     optimization in storage since otherwise it becomes infeasible to get
     the required storage in a DOS machine.
 
 14. I was given two lines of assembly code which found the absolute value
     of a number stored in two's complement form. I had to recognize what the
     code was doing. Pretty simple if you know some assembly and some fundaes
     on number representation.

 15. Give a fast way to multiply a number by 7. 

 16. How would go about finding out where to find a book in a library. (You 
     don't know how exactly the books are organized beforehand).

 17. Linked list manipulation.
 
 18. Tradeoff between time spent in testing a product and getting into the 
     market first.

 19. What to test for given that there isn't enough time to test everything
     you want to.
 
 20. First some definitions for this problem:
    a) An ASCII character is one byte long and the most significant bit
       in the byte is always '0'.
    b) A Kanji character is two bytes long. The only characteristic of a
       Kanji character is that in its first byte the most significant bit
       is '1'. 

     Now you are given an array of a characters (both ASCII and Kanji) and,
     an index into the array. The index points to the start of some character.
     Now you need to write a function to do a backspace (i.e. delete the 
     character before the given index).

 21. Delete an element from a doubly linked list.

 22. Write a function to find the depth of a binary tree.

 23. Given two strings S1 and S2. Delete from S2 all those characters which
     occur in S1 also and finally create a clean S2 with the relevant characters
     deleted.

 24. Assuming that locks are the only reason due to which deadlocks can occur
     in a system. What would be a foolproof method of avoiding deadlocks in 
     the system.

 25. Reverse a linked list.

     Ans: Possible answers - 

     iterative loop
       curr->next = prev;
       prev = curr;
       curr = next;
       next = curr->next
     endloop

     recursive reverse(ptr)
       if (ptr->next == NULL)
        return ptr;  
       temp = reverse(ptr->next);
       temp->next = ptr;
       return ptr;
     end


 26. Write a small lexical analyzer - interviewer gave tokens. expressions like
     "a*b" etc.

 27. Besides communication cost, what is the other source of inefficiency in RPC?
     (answer : context switches, excessive buffer copying).
     How can you optimise the communication? (ans : communicate through shared
     memory on same machine, bypassing the kernel _ A Univ. of Wash. thesis)

 28. Write a routine that prints out a 2-D array in spiral order!

 29. How is the readers-writers problem solved? - using semaphores/ada .. etc.

 31. A walk-through through the symbol table functions, lookup() implementation
     etc - The interv. was on the Microsoft C team.

     was a feedback process until we came up with one with no extra storage.

 35. The if (x == 0) y  = 0 etc..

 36. Some more bitwise optimization at assembly level

 37. Some general questions on Lex Yacc etc.

     'n' in the 'n' in n-way disk interleaving. (a tricky question, should
     be answered carefully)

 76. I was a c++ code and was asked to find out the bug in that. The bug
     was that he declared an object locally in a function and tried to
     return the pointer to that object.  Since the object is local to the
     function, it no more exists after returning from the function. The
     pointer, therefore, is invalid outside.

     they are shuffled.  Write a program to rearrange the 16 squares to
     get the original big square.

   8. An array of pointers to (very long) strings.
      Find pointers to the (lexicographically) smallest and largest strings.


Linked lists
============
 
*  0. Under what circumstances can one delete an element from a singly
      linked list in constant time?

*  1. Given a singly linked list, determine whether it contains a loop or not.

   2. Given a singly linked list, print out its contents in reverse order.
      Can you do it without using any extra space?

   3. Given a binary tree with <value, right-ptr, left-ptr> nodes,
      print out the values in pre-order/in-order/post-order without
      using any extra space.

   4. Reverse a singly linked list recursively. The function prototype is
                  node * reverse (node *) ;

Bit-manipulation
================

*  1. Reverse the bits of an unsigned integer.

*  2. Compute the number of ones in an unsigned integer.

   3. Compute the discrete log of an unsigned integer.

      of non-negative integers with the same number of ones in its binary
      representation as y, e.g. f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 2, f(3) = 1,
      f(4) = 3, f(5) = 2, f(6) = 3 and so on.
      Given k >= 0, compute f(k).

Graphics
========
 
   1. Write a function to check if two rectangles defined as below overlap
      or not.
         struct rect {
                 int top, bot, left, right;
         } r1, r2; 
 
   2. Write a SetPixel(x, y) function, given a pointer to the bitmap. Each
      pixel is represented by 1 bit. There are 640 pixels per row. In each
      byte, while the bits are numbered right to left, pixels are numbered
      left to right. Avoid multiplications and divisions to improve
      performance.

Databases
=========

*  1. You, a designer want to measure disk traffic i.e. get a histogram
      showing the relative frequency of I/O/second for each disk block.
      The buffer pool has b buffers and uses LRU replacement policy.
      The disk block size and buffer pool block sizes are the same.
      You are given a routine          int lru_block_in_position (int i)
      which returns the block_id of the block in the i-th position in the
      list of blocks managed by LRU.  Assume position 0 is the hottest.
      You can repeatedly call this routine.

      How would you get the histogram you desire?

     of the cake into two equal halves with one straight cut of a knife?

Others
======

   1. A character set has 1 and 2 byte characters. One byte characters
      have 0 as the first bit. You just keep accumulating the characters
      in a buffer. Suppose at some point the user types a backspace, how can
      you remove the character efficiently. (Note: You cant store the last
      character typed because the user can type in arbitrarily many
backspaces)
 
   2. What is the simples way to check if the sum of two unsigned integers
      has resulted in an overflow.

   3. How do you represent an n-ary tree? Write a program to print the
      nodes of such a tree in breadth first order.
 
   4. Write the 'tr' program of UNIX.
      Invoked as 
            tr -str1 -str2.
 
      It reads stdin and prints it out to stdout, replacing every occurance of
     str1[i] with str2[i].
 
      e.g. tr -abc -xyz
      to be and not to be   <- input
      to ye xnd not to ye   <- output
      <EOF>
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Interesting observations and answers:

Arrays
======

   1. Can be done in O(n) time and O(1) extra space. Scan array from
      1 to n. Remember the best subarray seen so far and the best
      subarray ending in i.
 
   2. [Is there an O(n) time solution that uses only O(1) extra
      space and does not destroy the original array?]

   3. Compute cumulative counts of integers in the auxiliary array.
      Now scan the original array, rotating cycles!
      [Can someone word this more nicely?]

   4. Can be done in O(k) time i.e. without initializing the 
      auxiliary array!

   5. If numbers are in 2's complement, an ordinary looking loop
      like for(i=total=0;i<n;total+=array[i++]); will do.
      No need to check for overflows!

   6. Write a routine to reverse a character array.
      Now call it for the given array and for each word in it.

   7. "Expected time" should ring a bell.
      To compute a random permutation, use the standard algo of
      scanning array from n downto 1, swapping i-th element with
      a uniformly random element <= i-th.
      To compute a unformly random integer between 1 and k (k < n),
      call rand_n() repeatedly until it returns a value in the
      desired range.

   8. Scan array in pairs. Remember largest-so-far and smallest-so-far.
      Compare the larger of the two strings in the current pair with
      largest-so-far to update it. And the smaller of the current pair
      with the smallest-so-far to update it.    For a total of <= 3n/2
      strcmp() calls.   That's also the lower bound.

Linked lists
============

   0. If the list is circular and there are no references to the nodes
      in the list from anywhere else!
      Just copy the contents of the next node and delete the next node.
      If the list is not circular, we can delete any but the last node
      using this idea. In that case, mark the last node as dummy!

   1. (a) Start reversing the list. If you reach the head, gotcha! there
          is a loop!
          But this changes the list.  So, reverse the list again.

      (b) Maintain two pointers, initially pointing to the head. Advance
          one of them one node at a time. And the othe one, two nodes
          at a time. If the latter overtakes the former at any time,
          there is a loop!

   2. Start reversing the list. Do this again, printing the contents.

   3. [Yet to think about]

   4. node * reverse (node * n)
      {
         node * m ;

         if (! (n && n -> next))
           return n ;
         
         m = reverse (n -> next) ;
         n -> next -> next = n ;
         n -> next = NULL ;
         return m ;
      }

Bit-manipulation
================

   1. #define reverse(x)                              \
              (x=x>>16|(0x0000ffff&x)<<16,            \
               x=(0xff00ff00&x)>>8|(0x00ff00ff&x)<<8, \
               x=(0xf0f0f0f0&x)>>4|(0x0f0f0f0f&x)<<4, \
               x=(0xcccccccc&x)>>2|(0x33333333&x)<<2, \
               x=(0xaaaaaaaa&x)>>1|(0x55555555&x)<<1)

   2. #define count_ones(x)                        \
              (x=(0xaaaaaaaa&x)>>1+(0x55555555&x), \
               x=(0xcccccccc&x)>>2+(0x33333333&x), \

   1. Simply do       histogram [lru_block_in_position (b-1)] ++ 
      at frequent intervals...  The sampling frequency should be close
      to the disk I/O rate. It can be adjusted by remembering
      the last block seen in position b. If same, decrease frequency;
      if different, increase, with exponential decay etc.
      And of course, take care of overflows in the histogram.
