There were two papers one was aptitude ( 36 questions) and other was 
technical(20 questions)

1: given an expression tree and asked us to write the in fix of that expression

four choices


2:

3)size of(int)
a) always 2 bytes
b) depends on compiler that is being used
c) always 32 bits
d) can't tell

4)which one will over flow given two programs

else printf("string not null");
}
what is out put of the program?
a) string is null b) string is not null c) error in program d) it executes but p
rint nothing



9)there are 0ne 5 pipe line and another 12 pipe line sates are there and flushed
 time taken to execute five instructions

a) 10,17
b) 9,16
c)25,144
d)


10)

for hashing which is best on terms of buckets
a)100 b)50 c)21 d)32  ans 32

11)


void f(int value){
for (i=0;i<16;i++){
if(value &0x8000>>1) printf("1")
else printf("0");
}
}
what is printed?
a) bineray value of argument b)bcd value c) hex value d) octal value

12)


void f(int *p){
static val=100;
val=&p;
}
main(){
int a=10;
printf("%d ",a);
f(&a);
printf("%d ",a);
}
what will be out put?
a)10,10

13)

struck a{
int x;
float y;
char c[10];
}
union b{
int x;
float y;
char c[10];
}
which is true?
a) size of(a)!=sizeof(b);
b)
c)
d)

14)


# define f(a,b) a+b
#defiune g(c,d) c*d

find valueof f(4,g(5,6))
a)26 b)51 c) d)

15)

find avg access time of cache
a)tc*h+(1-h)*tm b)tcH+tmH

c)    d)   tc is time to access cache tm is time to access when miss occure

16)

main()
{
char a[10]="hello";
strcpy(a,'\0');
printf("%s",a);
}
out put of the program?
a) string is null b) string is not null  c) program error d)

17)

simplyfy k map

1 x x 0
1 x 0 1

18)

int f(int a)
{
a=+b;

//some stuff


}

main()
{
x=fn(a);
y=&fn;
what are x & y types
a) x is int y is pointer to afunction which takes integer value



19)  char a[5][15];
int b[5][15];
address of a 0x1000 and b is 0x2000 find address of a[3][4] and b[3][4]
assume char is 8 bits and int is 32 bits

a) b) c) d)

there are 20 questions all in techinical paper and 36 questions in appititude te
st

in appititude thay have given all diagrams and asked to find what comes next

thay are quite easy and i hope if u practice r.s aggraval u can do it easily

for tecnical thay have given 1 hr for 20 questions and for not technical thay ha
ve given only 40 min
and 36 questions

this is the paper i have right now

1. main()
   {
    fork();
fork();
fork();
printf("\n hello");
}

How many times print command is executed?

2.main()
{
 int i,*j;
  i=5;
j=&i;
printf("\ni= %d",i);
 f(j);

printf("\n i= %d",i);
}

void f(int*j)
{
int k=10;
  j= &k;
}  

output is
a 5 10
b 10 5
c 5 5
d none

3.
  some question on pipeline like you have to findout the total time 
by which execution is completed for a pipeline of 5 stages.

4.

  main()
{
   int *s = "\0";

   if(strcmp(s,NULL)== 0)
     printf("\n s is null")p
    else
     printf("\n s is not null");
}

5. 
  some syntax which returns a pointer to function

6.  size of integer is
    a. 2 bytes
    b 4 bytes
    c. machine dependant
    d compiler dependent.

7.max and avg. height of sorted binary tree

a. logn n
b n logn

8.
  some question. like the number was shifted everytime by one and bitwise and with 10000000.
  one was supposed to find what the code was doing.
  I feel the answer was most probably finding decimal value.

9. int a[5][4]
   int is 2 bytes base address for array is 4000(Hexa)
   what will be addr for a[3][4]?
   int is 4 bytes same question.

10.
  implementation of priority queue
  a. tree
   b linked list 
    c doubly linked list.
