                        CISCO Y2K PAPER
                        ---------------

1> The starting location of an array is 1000. If the array[1..5/...4] is stored
in row major order, what is the location of element [4][3]. Each work occupies
4 bytes.

2> If the number of leaves in a binary tree are N, then the total number of
internal nodes........(Assume complete binary tree) 

ANS: N-1

3> The locality of reference means.............

4> If two ausigned 8 bit numbers are multiplied what is the memory space
required...............

5> The vector address of  RST 7.5 is ............

ANS: 003C (multiply 7.5 by 8 and convert to hex)

6>  int b = 0xAA;
    b>>4;
    printf("%x",b);

    What is the output of the above program....

7>  struct s1 { struct { struct {int x;}s2}s3}y;

    How to access x?  ANS: y.s3.s2.x


8>  Why there is no recursion in Fortran?

    ANS: There is no dynamic allocation 

9>  What is the worst case complexity of Quick sort?

    ANS: O(n^2)

10> Quick sort uses..............

    Ans: Divide and conquer

11> In a sequential search, the time it takes to search through n elements is

12> What is the size of the array declared as double * X[5]

    ANS: 5* sizeof (double *)

13> A binary search tree is given and asked to write the preorder traversal
    result.

14> If size of the physical memory is 2^32-1, then the size of virtual
memory......

15> S-> A0B
    A-> BB|0
    B-> AA|1  How many strings of length 5 are possible with the above
    productions??

16> (3*4096+15*256+3*16+3). How many 1's are there in the binary representation
of the result.

    ANS: 10

17> In memory mapped I/O how I/O is accessed.............

    ANS: Just like a memory location (Means, I/O devices can be accessed using
    the instructions like mov A,M etc...)

18> What is the use of ALE in 8085.......

    ANS: To latch the lower byte of the address.

19> If the logical memory of 8 X 1024 is mapped into 32 frames, then the number
of bits for the logical address ......

    ANS: 13

20>  Context free grammar is useful for...

    ANS: If-then structures.

21> In ternary number representation, numbers are represented as 0,1,-1. Here
-1 is represented as - (1 bar). Then how is 352/9 represented......
                     1
                     
22> There are processors which take 4,1,8,1 machine cycles respectively. If
these are executed in round robin fashion with a time quantum of 4, what is the
time it take for process 4 to complete....

ANS: 9

23> The minimum frequency of operation is specified for every processor
because......


24> In memory mapped I/O, what will happen if a device is identified with a 16
bit address and enabled by memory related control signals.....


25> The reason for preferring CMOS over NMOS is....

Ans: Low power consumption.

26> Two binary numbers A,B are given and asked to find out A-B.

27> Each character is represented by 7 bits, 1 bit is used to represent error
bit and another bit for parity. If total number of bits transmitted is
1200bits, then number of symbols that can be transmitted.......


28> One question about the setassociativity of cache..

29> Write the postfix form of the following expression...

    A+[[(B+C)+(D+E)*F]/G]

30> What is the function of the linker......

31> void f(int y)
    {
        struct s *ptr;
        ptr = malloc (sizeof (struct)+ 99*sizeof(int));
    }

    struct s{
        int i;
        float p;
        };

        when free(ptr) is executed, then what will happen??
