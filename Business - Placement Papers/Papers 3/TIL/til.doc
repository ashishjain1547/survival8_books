Verbal time is enough. But for numerical and letter series,timeis not
enough.  


So here Iam giving flow chart answersin sequence.  These answers are
perfectly in sequence,donot worry, youcan keep these answers blindly.

There are 7 flow charts we know only 6 flow charts answers.

Donot thinkabout these answers are correct or not , these are 100%
correct.  We tested here.

1.     D    B    A  E   C

2.	D   E C E  C


3. C  B D  B  D

4. D B  D C B

5. C E A D E
6. B C D A D


In hurry, I typed. Please cooperative.


Model :

Section 1  synonyms :  

section 2 numerical ability :   26questions 8min

section 3 letter series : 26 questions 10min

section 4 reasoning type : 14 questions 20min

setion 5 flow charts : 7 questions 35min


Each sectionis having separate time. I could not complete letter series,
numerical ability questions in time. Flow chartssection i kept within 5
min afterwards I cam back. If they see I will fuck you.  So be care.


Group discussion topics:

1. Brain drain: i.e. related to why immigration to U.S; I opposed
