I got this from one of the research scholars.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
One person from Uttar Pradesh (UP) was in Mysore forabout4 years and his
wife was in Jaunpur (UP).  At the end of 4 years he distributed sweets
to his colleages in office stating that his wife has delivered a Son.
His colleagues were quite shocked and they asked how this happened when
our friend was in Mysore and his wife in Jaunpur. He said it is common
in UP that neighbours take care of the wife (good Samaritans) when he is
at Mysore.

The colleagues asked him what name he would give to the son to which he
replied "If the second  neighbour from his house in Jaunpur is involved
then the name would be DWIVEDI, if it is the third neighbour then
it would be TRIVEDI, if it is the fourth neighbour then it would be
CHATURVEDI and if it is a mixture of all the three then it would be
named as MISHRA and if the wife feels shy to tell the name of the person 
involved then the name of the child would be SHARMA and if she refuses to 
divulge the name of the person involved then the name of the child would be
GUPTA. If she does not remember then it is YADAV ,if she becomes Red
faced on asking this then it is REDDY.If she is too enthusiastic 'bout
it then it is JOSHI.

2). A soldiar looses his way in a thick jungle  at  random  walks 
from his camp but  mathematically  in  an  interestingg  fashion.  
First he walks one mile east then half mile to north.   Then  1/4 
mile to west, then 1/8 mile to south and so  on  making  a  loop. 
Finally hoe far he is from his camp and in which direction.
ans: in north and south directions 
   1/2 - 1/8 + 1/32 - 1/128 + 1/512 - and so on 
                = 1/2/((1-(-1/4))

  first : I have three childern. Thew pproduct of their ages is  36 
.  If you sum their ages . it is exactly same as  my  neighbour's 
door number on my left. The  sacond  mathematiciaan  verfies  the 
door number and says that the not sufficient  .  Then  the  first 
says " o.k one more clue is that my youngest is the youngest"
Immmediately the second mathematician answers . Can  you  aanswer 
the questoion asked by the first mathematician?

THIS FILE CONTAINS THE QUESTIONS WHICH MS SCHOLARS FACED IN PLACEMENT
                   INTERVIEWS IN 1994 AND 1995



Name: Biswajit Sain

for(int i = 1; i <= 1; i++)
{
	Company name: Wipro Infotech Ltd., Bangalore.
	Year: 1995

Wipinfo has 2 rounds of interviews. The first round is fully technical.
The second round, depending on the members of the board, may be
technical,
semi-technical or personal. Last year the second round was more
technical than the first(!) and the board was headed by Mr. P.V.Sanjeeva
Reddy, one of the no-nonsense, hardcore-technical, project leaders
in Infotech. This year it was headed by Mr. Victor Jayakiran, G.M.
(Technical, Global R&D) who was a much sober man and therefore spent
most of the time in the second round dealing with personal questions.

I detail here the technical questions asked in the first round --
--------------------------------------------------------------

[1] Tell us about your work in brief.
My Ans. Mention first the title, followed by a brief overview of the
work, what we plan to achieve, what has been achieved so far, finally
the relevance/scope of the work to the related area (i.e. how is it
going to be useful).	[ 5-10 mins. depending on interest of the
listener.]

[2..n] Questions related to the work.
Ans. Area dependent. [ ~ 10 mins ]

[n+1] Tell us what you know about DMA and why that is needed?
My Ans. As usual, mentioned the wastage of CPU computation power spent
in busy-waiting. Told how DMA works.

[n+2] What are the various types of scheduling algo, what is used by
UNIX?
My Ans. Mentioned Round Robin, First-come-first-served,
Shortest-job-first, Earliest-deadline-first, Least-laxity-first,
Priority-based-event-driven. UNIX uses RR with multi-level feedback.

[n+3] How can you implement SJF in UNIX?
My Ans. Usually, SJF means that we know the job-duration in advance. In
UNIX where we cannot know that, we have to make assumptions about that
based on which we should initially schedule. Periodically however, we
have to fine-tune our initial assumptions based on the times taken by
various ready jobs, and recompute estimates and change the schedule
accordingly.

[n+4] Different types of subroutine calling conventions?
My Ans. Call by value, reference, value-result.

[n+5] Parameter passing sequence used by C?
My Ans. Rightmost parameter pushed first on stack.

[n+6] What is a page-fault and how is it handled in UNIX?
My Ans. [Refer to MJBach, Ch. 9 for details].

Personal questions in the first round --
-------------------------------------

1. What was your overall position in the Univ. in B.E.
2. Why did you choose to join MS here.
3. How do you like the MS course.
4. Anything you want to know about us.

Technical Questions in the second round --
---------------------------------------

[1] What are the current trends and areas of focus in IT.
My Ans. Talked about emerging trends of S/W Engg and ISO 9000 stuff
(gave vague ideas about them as I don't know much nor do I care 
about these topics myself ;-)). Then mentioned the proliferation of O-O
methodologies and their usefulness in speeding up development process,
code re-usability, ease of maintenance, ease of bug-fixing.
Thirdly, mentioned the work going on in High-Speed N/w - FDDI, ATM,
Fast-Ethernet(100Mbps). Told whatever little I knew about ATM in
response to another question.

[2] What is a Micro-Kernel architecture.
My Ans. This is a developing area in OSs where  instead of building the
kernel as a single monolithic structure starting from scratch, it is
built as a set of layers. The micro-kernel provides only the bare-bones
like Device-drivers, rudimentary filesystem support etc. on which,
depending on the intended area of application of the OS, it can be
customized to provide various higher level OS features like
Multiprocessing, IPC, etc. 

Personal Questions in the second round --
--------------------------------------

1. Tell us about yourself, your background.
2. What does your father do currently.
3. Your performance in schooling, B.E.
4. Your +/- points.
5. Why do you think Wipro should take you.

   FIRST INTERVIEW:(First the interviewer asked me to name two 
                    favorite subjects - OS and Networks)
   a) Describe the memory management policies in Unix. How is paging
      implemented? How page faults are handled? 
      Seems to be a favorite question for these chaps ---- Maurice Bach. 
   
   b) Write a macro in C for swapping two nibbles in a byte.
      -Use the shift operators and be careful while defining temporary 
      variables( if you do so) as you have to write a macro. Otherwise
      it is pretty simple.

   c) What is the CPU-scheduling policy in Unix? - Round robin scheduling
      with multilevel queues.

   d) Diffrence between short term, long term and medium term scheduler.
      -First two should be peaceful. The last one is also known as 
       swapper. (See Taenenbaum and/or Peterson)

   e) Name various page-replacement policies. Which can be implemented
      both with and without pre-emption? - see Peterson.

   f) Describe the Sliding window protocol. What is it's advantage
      over stop-and-wait? - Saves bandwidth. (Taenenbaum please)


   2ND INTERVIEW (Both personal and technical interleaved)
   a) Tell us something about yourself.
   b) Aren't you going for higher studies abroad? Why?
   c) Rank and CGPA. MSites do not have ranks but still they wanted to
      know my approx position in my batch. 
      - Shady question. It is your job to convince them that for
      MS, grades do not hold any meaning.

   d) What is re-entrant code? --- Non-self modifying code. Can be 
      shared by many processes simultaneously. Gave e.g. of text-editors
      like 'vi'.
      Counter Q: But then no code modifies itself. What does 'non-self 
      modifying' mean? ---- I don't know for sure.

   e) Diff between compilers and interpreters. Some fundaes about
      how to link code in  different files. 

   f) What would your friends tell us about you if we ask them?
      Standard question for everyone.



Company: Motorola (came in August'95)
Just one question: When do you expect to finish? ---By August'96
                   That is too late. We are looking for guys who
                   finish by Jan'96. Pl. apply a month before you 
                   submit your thesis. Thank you very much.


Company: HCL-HP
Written test:
One GRE type anals. section, and two comp Sc. sections. One Comp Sc. 
section was problem solving type. Quite easy. Only question worth mentioning
in it was:
    You are given a stack on which you can do the following:

    Push X ----push the contents of memory location X on the stack
    Pop X  ----pop the contents of top of stack into mem. loc X
    AND    ----pop top two elements of stack, AND them and push the
               result onto stack.
    NOR    ----pop top two elements, NOR them and push the result onto stack.

Given two data elements at memory locations A and B, obtain A XOR B using 
the above.

First Interview:- mostly technical.

	a) Asked about my B.E. and why I joined MS.

	b) My preference of posting. They asked this initially before
	   launching into any other questions. I told them Madras.
	   Remainder of the interview was mostly on OS and C. Nothing
	   on networks. Thus I have this inkling that they frame their 
	   questions on the basis of what you specify as your preference 
	   of posting and  depending on what projects are available there.

	c) What architectures, apart from 8085, do you know? --- Nothing 
	   very deep and I told them as much.

	d) Give the contents of process stack for the execution of 
	   a particular C-program they give. 
	   ------ The C-program as such is not important. You just have 
	   to remember the order in which the return address of any 
	   function/procedure call, the parameters, and the local variables
	   are stored on the stack. 
	   ( I guess, any CO book should have this. Maurice Bach talks 
	   about user and kernel stacks)

	e) What all are shared by parent and child processes immediately
	   after parent executes a fork system call? Cross questioned
	   about the 'copy on write' facility and 'dup' system call. 
	   --- again see MB, and also Stevens' 2nd chapter.

	f) What events happen when the following command is given?
		cat /etc/passwd | more 

	   ---- Describe how the shell forks the two processes and how
		the pipe gets created between them. 
	  Cross question: How does 'cat' know that its output has to be 
	                  written into the pipe and not into standard o/p?
			  

	g) Have you written any TSR's? --- No.
	   What are TSR? ----Terminate but stay resident programs.
	   Then does it mean DOS is a multitasking system? 
	   ---- No, TSRs are interrupt driven

	h) How are Windows programs different from normal C-programs?
	   ---- Windows programs are event driven.
	   What can be the various types of events? --- See Primer/API bible.

	i) Difference between swapping and paging. 
	   ---- Swapping is moving entire processes between main memory
	   and hard disk. Paging is moving individual pages of a process.
	   
	j) Write a program to list all palindromes in a string.
	   ----- Hint: use a stack and some extra storage for remembering
	   previous palindromes.

	k) What's the outout?

		char *cp;
		int *ip;

		cp=(char *)0x100;
		ip=(int *)cp;

		ip++;
		cp++;
		printf("cp = %x ip = %x", cp, ip);

		Ans:cp = 0x101 ip = 0x102 ...(why?)

	l) What are static variables and functions? There are two files,
	   say, file1 and file2. file1 has a global declaration
			static int x;
	  file2 has a global declaration
			int y;
	  What is the difference between the two types of declarations
	  when you link file1 and file2? 
	  --- x is local to functions in file1 and cannot be seen by  
	      functions in file2. y can be seen by functions in both 
	      file1 and file2.

	m) How does a debugger set breakpoints in a code you are debugging?
	   ---- some funda regarding insertion if an interrupt instruction
	        in the code....don't know for sure.
	  (It seems that this q was also asked by some other company.
	   Worth knowing the answer.)

This was followed by a shady psychological test. You are given a 
set of six pictures. Look at each picture and write a story on each.

Second interview: (fully personal) --- This was more interesting;-)
	a) What did you feel about the ppt? --- wasn't very impressive
	  so gave some shady answer.
	b) Have you heard of creativity? -- Ya.
	   Have you heard of Bernard Shaw? -- Ya.
	   (Then he rattled off some quote of BS regarding creativity)
	   What do you say? --- I put some shadiest fundaes regarding
	   visionaries and Leonardo da Vinci conceptualising Helicopters
	   in his time!
