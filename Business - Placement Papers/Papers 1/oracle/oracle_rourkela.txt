For questions 6-10, read the passage and answer the
questions that 
follow:

At a time when impressive breakthroughs in technology
are providing new 
and better products and services, when improved
communications are 
transforming thw world into a global village, and when
democracies are 
sprouting in former communist lands, we are
simultaneously witnessing 
events that makie us questioin whether so much
progress is indeed 
"progress".
For example, we see reports of widespread bribery by
Italina and 
Japanese government officials, exorbitant salaries for
executives in North 
America, extensive environmental pollution in eastern
Europe, and other 
instances of immoral or morally questionable conduct
in our 
organizations. In many otherwise prospeous and afluent
cities, we see an increase 
in the numbers of homeless people. Even those who are
fortunate enough 
to have a job find that work is not only not an
opportunity for growth, 
but a source of anxiety and insecurity.
In the popular media as well as in academic journals,
we see great 
interest in the proposition that business and other
organizations leaders 
need to become more responsible not just ot their
stock jolders but also 
to other stake holders- consumers, employees,
suppliers,government, and 
locla communites.
Put simply, the quality of life and perhaps the
survivial of society 
depend on the moral caliber of its members. This moral
caliber, however, 
is largely determined by people in leadership
positions. The way 
leaders function in their positions of influence
directly contributes to 
strengthening pr weakening the moral fiber or society.
The lives of Buddha, 
Mohammed, Lao-Tzu, Gandhi and Socrates attest to their
salutary 
influence in their own way as well as for all time.
A human being functions not just through the physical
body but also 
through the use of the intellect and the will. The
intellect penetrates 
those deep levels of reality that are spiritual in
nature but that the 
physical senses and processes cannot access. It does
this through 
abstract concepts and ideas that help to make sense of
and give meaning to the 
acts in the light of spiritual knowledge. It helps us
to make moral 
choices in living a spiritually guided life.
How do we describe the concept of spirituality and its
place in that 
domain? Spirituality is difficult to define in a
manner that is 
universally acceptablke because religious beliefs and
rites differ widely age to 
age and from one society to another. However, if we
analyze the 
spiritual experience per se and its behavioral
manifestations among 
individuals of different religious backgrounds, there
is much accord on the 
understanding and appreciation of the essence of
spirit at three levels: 
cognitive, affective, and outward behavior.
At a cognitive level,spiritual experience represents a
realization 
that,a t the core of human existence, there is set of
virtues and vices. 
Virtues - prudence, justice, fortitude, and
temperance- are good habits 
that enable us to stirve toward relizng our full
potential. Ideally, the 
goal of human life is to live these values and
overcome the vices.
At an affective or emotional level, the spiritual
experience represents 
a complete trust and dependence on such virtues. In
its most sublime, 
the spiritual experience represents a complete
identification with these 
values,or with an individual embodying these values,
tha aim being to 
achieve some forme of enduring blissful state of
existence.
How is the spiritual experience expressed in outward
behavior? What are 
the sources of the norms andd principles within the
spiritual domain? 
Response to such questions generally come from
prescriptions of moral 
observance of the laws. It is not a question of an act
being legal or 
illegal, but whether the act is good or evil. A
morally good act is 
necessarily an expression of a spirtual act.
The ability to distinguish between morally good and
evil acts is 
critical to the formation of character. Knowing
ehtical principles alone is 
of little value unless we make an effort to habitually
incorporate these 
principles in our behaviour.
In the final analysis, the reward of the spiritual
experience is that 
it enables each individual to grow and fully realize
the tremendous 
potential unique to that person. If a good moral
character is of the 
essence of every human being, thern with much greater
reason does it become 
so of leaders who, in the words of Stanford management
professor Harold 
Leavitt, by their "vision, values, and determination,
add soul to the 
organization".

Questions 24-25 are based on the following:

The fewer restricitons there are on the advertising of
legal services, 
the more lawyers there are who advertise their
services, and the 
lawyers who advertise a specific service usually
charge less for that service 
than lawyers who do not advertise. Therefroe, if the
state removes any 
of its current restrictions, such as the ones against
advertisements 
that do not specify fee arrangements, overall consumer
legal costs will 
be lower than if the state retains its current
restrictions.

24. If the statements are true, which of the following
must be true?

1]Some lawyers, who now advertise will charge more for
specific 
services if they do not have to specify fee
arrangements in the 
advertisements.
2]More consumers will use legal services if there are
fewer 
restrictions on the advertising of legal services.
3]If the restriction against advertisements that do
not specify fee 
arrangements is removed more lawyers will advertise
their services.
4]If more lawyers advertise, lawyers who do not
advertise will also 
charge less than they currently charge for those
services.

25. Which of the following. if true, would most
seriously weaken the 
argument concerning overall consumer legal costs?

1]The state has recently removed some other
restrictions that had 
limited the advertising of legal services.
2]The state is unlikely to remove all of the
restrictions that apply 
solely to the advertising of legal services.
3]Most lawyers who now specify fee arrangements in
their advertisements 
would continue to do so even if the specifications
were not required.
4]Most lawyers who advertise specific services do not
lower their fee 
for those services when they begin to advertise.

26.In a certain election only 2/5th of the voters
promised to vote for 
P and the rest for Q. However on the day of elections,
15 voters went 
back on their promise to P and voted for Q. Similarly

election by two 
votes. The number of votes in the election is 

1]90 2]110 3]130 4]None of these. 

27. A bath has two taps and a waste pipe. One of the
taps on the

seven and half 
minutes. Now if we start with an empty bath with both
taps fully on, when 
(if ever) will the bath be full if the waste pipe is
left open?

1]15 min 2]44 min 3]22.5 min 4] 30 min
