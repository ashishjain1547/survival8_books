C Test..
--------

time is very less. Be fast.

      int bvalue;
      }both;
      }

      if malloc returns 1000 then what is th evalue of a+2?

     1000+sizeof (int)*2




INterview
-------------

  there are 3 rounds of interview. 1-technical (around 45 min to 1 hour)
  2- HR interivew(20 min)   3-Technical( around 30 minutes)

mainly cocentrate the topics that u mentioned in ur RESUME.

interest.

project in BTEch

Distributed,
freeing of memory
NEtworks:DLL protocols(SLIP.PPP), security socket layer, HTTP,IP
SE: this the compulsory questions...SDLC     
IP: FFT

HR interview:
------------

  team leader qualities
who is ur role model
ur strong points,weak  points
