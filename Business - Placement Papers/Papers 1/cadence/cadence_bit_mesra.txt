THERE WERE MANY QUESTION FROM CADENCE 97 AND CADENCE
99
10 qs were from s/w and 10 from h/w and
rest 50 qs were from Aptitude. total time alloted was
75 min.
  most of them were of GRE type.
There were some qs in figures, ie find the next
figure
Also find the odd one out, among some figures etc,
jumbled words, refer to
some IMS material on non verbal figurative test.
then ther wer paragraph based qs
with some meanings also, comprehension qs,
also some qs on suffix and prefix eg
BEG__SIDE is given, 'IN' if filled in the blanks
