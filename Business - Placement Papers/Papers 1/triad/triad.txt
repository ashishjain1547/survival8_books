TRIAD PAPER
*******************
C - language:
1. write a program to calculate ncr
2. write a program to exchange the values of two variables
using
pointers
3. write program to open one file input some numbers and find
smallest,largest, avg. and store them in another file.
4. write a structure node using linked list
5. write a program to reverse a string
co-ordinate geometry
1. find the perpendicular distance from a point P(a,b) to a
line lx+my+n=0;
2. y=x^3+2x^2+5x+2 find the slope of this eqn when x=12;
( Hint :find dy/dx and substitute x=12)
3. circle is x^2+y^2=a^2 . if the centre is shifted to (25,16)
what
is the eqn of new cirlce.
4. pt rotation P(x,y) about origin in anticlockwise direction
by an
angle theta. find new coordinates.
before this there will be some question on puzzles(gre
barrons).
prepare co-ordinate geometry and fundamental of c.
