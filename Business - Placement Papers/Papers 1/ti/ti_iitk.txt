Here is the C section.(not in order)

1. x=x^y;
   y=x^y;
   x=x^y;
x=?

2. In a link list we want to go from last to first element and vice
versa.
Which is efficient
a. Cirular List
b. Doubly Link List
c. Double Ended Link List
d. Simple List

3.Hash function h(i)=i mod 5, there are 5 buckets 0,1,2,3,4. Rehashing is
(h(i)+1)mod 5,(h(i)+2)mod 5......
5 numbers are to be enterd, Find the number in a given bucket..

4.To reconstuct a Tree which sequence is enough
a. Inoreder sequence
b. Preorder and Post order
c. In, Pre, Post order are required
d. Any one can be used

5. (i)
for(i=0;i<MAX;i++)
for(j=0;j<MAX;j++)
a[i][j]=0;

(ii)
for(i=0;i<MAX;i++)
for(j=0;j<MAX;j++)
a[j][i]=0;    

Which code is faster if demand Paging used.

6.convert a inorder string to post order

7.int (*a[5])() what is this declaration?
