motorola -- bit mesra (non-DSp paper)
-----------------
The paper consisted of 20 qs on C,C++,and Data
structures. One qs on JAVA.
1. ((A*B)+C)*((D*E)+F) - convert this infix to postfix
expression.
2. struct s{
  char a;
  int t;
 }
 /* comment */
 main()
 {int x=3;
  return;}
 what's wrong with the program ?
3.Elements 0,1,2,...(M-1) are stored in positions
0,1,...(M-1) of the
array A. Then A[A[i]] = ?
4.M elements are stored in positions 1 to M of the
array A. How will
you
access the elements of the array in reverse order ?
5.Which operator cannot be overloaded in C++ ?
6.What is the output ?
main()
{
 int x,y;
 x=0;
 y=(x)?-1:1;
 printf("%d",y);
}
7.What is quick sort's best case and worst case ?
8.unsigned long fact(unsigned long number)
{
 if c_____==0
   return _____;
 else return _____*fact( );
}
Fill the blank spaces in the above program to
calculate the
factorial.
9.How can the unary operator ++ be overloaded in C++
for postfix
operation ?
10.A program MAX takes integers as inline arguements
and gives the
greatest
 integer as output. What will be the value of argc if
the program
is
 invoked as MAX 12 51 17 15 ?
11.For a program of the order O(f(n))=2^n, what will
be the order if
we double
 the number of elements to be sorted ?
12.What is the worse case and best case behaviour of
the sequential
search ?
13.Which is the false statement about publically
derived class in C++
?
 (Four options were there which I don't remember)
14.fact(int x)
 {
  int n;
  n=x;
  return fact(x-1);
 }
 What is the size of the stack ?
 i) infinity ii) n iii) n*(n-1) iv) depends on
compiler and
processor used.
15.How are lock and interlock operations performed
inside Java ?
16 - 17 Questions on Java.  What is the use of API ?
18.What is the size of structure : struct s{
                                 int abc; float e;
char f;}
 Ans : Machine dependent.
19.struct s{int i; struct s * next;}
 struct s* funct(struct s* h) {return
h==0?0:(h->next==0?h:funct(h-
>next))}
 This is a program for singly linked list. What is
this program
doing ?

#JavaBeans-- which of the following statement is
wrong?
a)JavaBeans is an applet ....
b)JavaBeans is used to create buttons,text box ,
etc.....
c)JavaBeans is named after a famous comedy serial on
Mr. Bean 

# the 2 programs to be written in C were:
1)traverse to the last node of a given singly linked
list without using the conventional methods involving
loops
(Hint: Use recursion)
2)Inorder traversal of a given Binary tree and process
each node using a pointer to a processing function
that is defined somewhere else.
# Fill in the blanks questions:
*Insertion sort , its order and no. of comaprisons
*there was a program --an easy one-- with some blanks
to be filled
#f(n)=O(g(n)) means:
ans:if there exist positive constants c and n0 such
that f(n) <= c*g(n)  for n,n>=n0.
#in sequencial search no.of comparision reuired for n
numbers for successful search is A(worst case) and
that for unsuccessful search is B.then a=? b=?
