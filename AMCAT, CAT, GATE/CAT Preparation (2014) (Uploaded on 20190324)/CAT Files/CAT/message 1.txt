Subject: Strategy for those preparing for CAT - 2005


Hi , 
Following is a rough time table we have prepared for those 
taking CAT next year. You may change it according to your 
strengths and weaknesses. If you are not sure of your strengths 
and weaknesses, write two mock tests and spend 2 hours on 
analysis of each. 
We would request all those taking CAT next year to please go 
through the past message archive before posting any message 
here. Specially for the next couple of months we would request 
them to be more of a spectator so that we can concentrate on 
those who are appearing for exams this year. Most of the queries 
have already be answered and are available at our message 
archive. We soon plan to put all the important information in a 
more arranged manner at our website www.urpercentile.com so 
that you can find what you need easily. 

Names of books to refer are available at our database section, 
you may add names of more books there.
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/urpercentile/database

Please download files from files section, these are very 
informative and will prevent you from posting queries that need 
not be posted. 
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/urpercentile/files/

Please cast your votes on various issues, it will help you to know 
what others feel like on a particular issue , like -Is Coaching 
important, Is it necessary to drop a year for preparation etc. 
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/urpercentile/polls


So here is the  rough timetable for you :

1) 1st Dec to 15th March :   Read the syllabus. The syllabus is 
available in file called "What is Cat.doc" , uploaded by Nikhil at 
our files section.  
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/urpercentile/files/What%20is%20CAT.doc 
 Start working on your vocabulary and for RC section now as this 
cannot be done in a short time and needs a continuos efforts 
over a period of time. You may devote 1 hour a day for this 
section by reading newspapers and magazines.  Read from 
various sources on different subjects.  Keep a dictionary handy 
and consult it whenever required, keep a diary of new words you 
come across.  Start working on fundamentals for mathematics 
and on topics where you consider yourself as weak.  
Multiplication of numbers till 25*25 should be remembered. 
Squares and cubes of numbers till 25 should be remembered. 
Pythogoras triplets with any all the arms less than 200 should be 
remembered.  Start working on mental calculations with 
percentages, fractions  etc. 

After 15th March continue to spend 30 minutes on reading 
newspapers, magazines etc everyday till the end.

2) From 16th March to 11th April : Devote 1 hour and 30 minutes 
everyday for Data Interpretation and Data sufficiency. 

3) From 12th April to 10th May : Devote 1 hour and 30 minutes 
everyday for Logical Reasoning and Verbal reasoning.

4) 11th May to 7th June , Take section tests on Data 
Interpretation , data sufficiency etc.

4) 7th June till end of June for Arithmetic and Algebra.

5) 1st July till 21st July for Geometry, Set theory, Probability and 
remaining part of QA.

6) 22nd July to 7th Aug for Section tests on QA.

7) 8th Aug to 21st Aug for section tests on English. By now you 
should score well as you have devoted 1 hour a day on reading 
newspaper and on improving your vocabulary.

8) 21st Aug to 10th Sept for the section you think you did not 
perform well in your section test.

9 ) From 10th Sept to Oct end : Take Full time Mock test twice a 
week. In Nov  till CAT is held take 3 test a week. You should be 
comfortably able to take 25 full time test.

Note : After each section test and Full time test you must go back 
and solve the questions which you could not solve during the 
given time and the ones that you did not solve correctly. 
Spend 2 hours on analysis after each mock.

Hi, 

17 messages in today's edition.

We have created a new database where you can put your 
expected score and can see the expected scores of others. 
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/urpercentile/database 

There were around 10 messages from people wishing to buy or 
sell forms and study material, most of these have not included 
here. We have created a new database for all those who want to 
buy/sell. Please fill the details there. Needless to say, you will be 
dealing on your own risk. We will keep sending a reminder here 
so that more and more people read your advertisement.

Message 1 from  Vikram looking for old MAT papers. Please 
upload at the files section if anyone has.  

Message 2 from  Tan-Vela seeking help for various exams. 
Yesterday we posted details about JMET, SNAP and XAT 
available at :
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/urpercentile/message/449
Today we provide information on FMS and IRMA paper. 
The FMS paper has 150 questions to be attempted in two hours. 
There are no sections time limits. 
Marking scheme of last year was +4 for correct answers and –1 
for incorrect answers.
The last year paper had 150 question :
1. Quant & Reasoning: 60 questions
2. English Usage & RC : 60 Questions
3. GK : 30 questions 
GK includes :  Business Awareness, Economics, Brands related 
questions, Companies details,   Current Affairs, Science, Sports, 
Major events etc.
In Quant you may find more questions from higher school level 
mathematics like co-ordinate geometry, logarithm, permutation 
and combination, differentiation etc. 
The emphasis should be more on accuracy than speed as with 
30 questions on GK take less than 15 minutes and you have 105 
minutes to solve remaining 120 question. Out of these 120 
question a few question based on vocabulary should take less 
than 30 second each to solve. 
As the paper has no Sectional Cut off the aim should be to 
maximise your total score by attempting more questions in the 
scoring topics and on topics you are comfortable at. 


IRMA paper was of 2 hours with  200 questions and  no 
sectional time limits.
1 mark for every correct answer and –1/4 for every incorrect 
answer.

Questions on GK and  GA give more importance to social and

farmers, agricultural, dairy and food products, food production 
and processing, import and export of food products, irrigation 
and dams ,  NGOs, Non profit organisations, etc may be
