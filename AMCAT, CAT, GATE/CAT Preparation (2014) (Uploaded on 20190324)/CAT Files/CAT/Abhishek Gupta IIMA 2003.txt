hello everyone

we must all be thankful to abhishek gupta who took out time to
explain the fundas involved in cracking CAT. really, in today's
world who cares to give time where no profit's involved.kudos to
his spirit of altruism... 
so the delay's over and given below is a summary of the meeting
which was presided over by abhishek gupta.
here u go :
 
>    he had given CAT in 2001 and appeared for GD and PI. he
excelled in GD but messed up the PI as he says he was
overconfident.

>    so ,make it a point to be humble in ur interview . do not
hesitate in saying, "i am really sorry,sir/madam".

>    be suave and display the best of etiquettes in GD. it's not
necessary to know abt the topic to crack  the GD ,u can  
easily  pick   up somebody else's point to resell it to the group.

>    he had entered the GD 3-4 times and concluded the GD  in
an impressive manner.

>    donot indulge in 1 2 1 conversations in GD.

>    donot stick to any one question in CAT.big deal if u can't
answer a question u practised a lot .stay cool during CAT.

>    do develop ur hobbies very well.it's a must.say if it's reading a
novel,then specialize in one author and know ,say , abt the family
of the author etc.

 >    he recommends reading 1 newspaper and 1 magazine with
a motive to know the structure of the sentences and noting down
10 words a day from the dictionary into a vocab diary and
referring it of and on. for that matter .he keeps 3 dictionaries: 1 in
his car, 1 in his room and 1..guess where...ofcourse in his
office.he has 2 1/2 years of work-ex.

>    more than really knowing the answers to the questions being
fired at u in  the interview ,what matters is how u handle it .u
might be giving a wrong answer undelibrately ,but can u still
deliver it smoothly..that's what matters

>    his interview started with a laugh and ended with a laugh.so
if u can make the environment light in the interview room, half
the battle is won.

>    he had a 10 minute debate with a panelist over the
importance of social responsibility and was firm on his stand
that it cannot be done away with.

>    DI :practise

>    try dashing out a performance in the PI such that the panelist
remembers ur face and strongly feels that u shud not be
missed.

>yes most important BLESSINGS OF PARENTS & TEACHERS!
 
hope it helps!!
 
all the best!!
