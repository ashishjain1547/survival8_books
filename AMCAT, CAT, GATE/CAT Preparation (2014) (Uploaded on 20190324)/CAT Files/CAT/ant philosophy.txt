The Ant Philosophy or, How Not To Quit

They'll climb over, they'll climb under, they'll climb around. They 
keep
looking for another way. 

Over the years I've been teaching children about a simple but powerful
concept - the ant philosophy. I think everybody should study ants. 

They have an amazing four-part philosophy, and here is the first part:
ants never quit. That's a good philosophy. If they're headed somewhere
and you try to stop them; they'll look for another way. 

They'll climb over, they'll climb under, they'll climb around. They 
keep
looking for another way. What a neat philosophy, to never quit looking
for a way to get where you're supposed to go. 

Second, ants think winter all summer. That's an important perspective.
You can't be so naive as to think summer will last forever. So ants are
gathering in their winter food in summer. 

The third part of the ant philosophy is that during the winter, ants
remind themselves, ''This won't last long; we'll soon be out of here.'' 

And the first warm day, the ants are out. If it turns cold again,
they'll dive back down, but then they come out the first warm day. They
can't wait to get out. 

And here's the last part of the ant philosophy. How much will an ant
gather during the summer to prepare for the winter? All that he 
possibly
can. Be like the ant. Go ahead, do all you can!
