3.4.Congestion and Infrastructure Pricing
</A></H3>

<P>We have been witnessing the transformation of the Internet from being
an academic and research network into a medium for fun, education,
exploration, communication, propaganda, and, most of all, for doing business, aided by
the spread of the World Wide Web, networked computing, and electronic
commerce. Congestion is beginning to cripple network performance,
however, substantially diminishing the net benefits of users and service providers.
To witness, Dan Rather on the CBS television news on the election night,
November 5, 1996, reported the near collapse of the Internet due to people
trying to access election results nationwide. America Online instituted a monthly
flat-rate, only to be inundated by complaints (and lawsuits) from its
members being frustrated by congestion. The Internet, in the short time it
received spotlight in the popular press, has acquired its ignominious nickname:
the World Wide Wait.
</P>

<P>These problems are inherent in the current Internet infrastructure and
are likely to grow worse for at least the following three reasons:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>          The number of people who have acquired Internet connectivity
is doubling every year. Further, the bandwidth requirements of
future multimedia applications such as video conferencing and
movies-on-demand are orders of magnitude greater than current uses (which
are predominantly text-based). Although bandwidth capacity is
increasing dramatically (from 56 kbps a decade ago to 45 mbps currently and
1 gbps in the near future), it is doubtful that capacity growth can keep
up with demand growth, and in any event serious bottlenecks will
remain at the connection pipelines to the backbone. Hence, key resources
are and will remain scarce for the foreseeable future.
</UL>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-110"><P>Page 110</P></A>

<UL>

<LI>          The pricing strategies of infrastructure owners and access
providers complicate the issue. Infrastructure owners charge flat fees for
access, and access providers use either a price based on time of usage, or,
as recent trends indicate, a flat monthly fee. Neither takes the level
of congestion into account. A &quot;tragedy of the commons&quot; emerges in
which the social value generated by the Internet is diminished by overuse
and inefficient use.
<LI>          The system rations resources according to user patience rather
than social value. Although impatient users will voluntarily leave a
congested network, they are not necessarily the low-value users. Without
incentive-compatible priorities, mission critical applications have
no guarantee of precedence over others, or any expected level of
performance. A teenager with idle time can download tetrabytes of
entertaining video clips, blocking a cardiac surgeon from receiving vital
X-ray data from a distant hospital in time to save a patient.
</UL>

<P>The challenge is how to manage the traffic and resources in a manner
that permits the full realization of the potential of the Internet. Current efforts
to manage network resources fall into two basic categories:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>           Engineering fixes, and
<LI>           Non-incentive-compatible priority schemes
</UL>

<P>The engineering fixes involve substantial increases in capacity at
bottlenecks&#151;which are overloaded routers, regional networks, Internet
access points, modem banks, and local telephone lines. This approach may work
in the short term; however, it is expensive and is doomed to fail in the
long-run because bandwidth use will always expand to fill the available capacity. There
is no apparent upper limit on bandwidth uses. If capacity is expanded to
handle real-time video, 3-D imaging will demand more
bandwidth, and after that virtual reality, and so on. Further, the congestion that arises from the
current inefficient pricing schemes can lead to inappropriate and ineffective
infrastructure investments.
</P>
<A NAME="PAGENUM-111"><P>Page 111</P></A>



<P>The next generation Internet Protocol IPv6 (Deering and Hinden, 1995)
is trying to address the performance issue by moving away from a
best-effort, first-come first-serve approach to one of differentiating traffic based on
priority classes and associating priorities with different application classes. Such
solutions, however, still do not consider the criticality of the usage context and
are prone to misuse. Just because a video stream requires better response time,
for example, it does not mean a recreational video should be preferred over
a simple text stream being used for a stock purchase. Moreover, the
priority selection in IPv6 is non-incentive-compatible: Nothing prevents a user
or application from artificially boosting its priority to achieve better performance.
</P>

<P>Recent research in computer science has been increasingly drawing
from economic theory to design resource allocation schemes, otherwise referred to
as load balancing schemes. Economics, being the study of resource
allocation problems, can provide answers, and the standard economic answer is to
create markets and let prices allocate the scarce resources. The economic answer
for the Internet, however, is a bit more complicated. First, because most of
the costs are sunk into infrastructure, the marginal cost of Internet data
transport is essentially zero, so if Internet resources were private goods prices should
be zero. Note that this discussion separates the process of data transport from
the process of producing the information content of the packet being
transported, and focuses now on the former. Second, Internet resources are public
goods and consequently congestion is a potential negative externality.
Marginal-cost pricing of public goods can lead to a &quot;tragedy of the commons,&quot; in which
the common resource is overutilized, causing avoidable losses for the whole
society. When negative externalities are real possibilities, prices should exceed
the marginal cost of production by the marginal social cost of the congestion,
in which case a consumer uses the resource if and only if his or her private
benefit from use exceeds the social cost of that usage. This is the theoretical
economic argument underpinning virtually all proposals for usage-based pricing
of Internet resources. Differences in how to implement this theoretical
ideal separate the different proposals.
</P>
<A NAME="PAGENUM-112"><P>Page 112</P></A>



<P>One potential barrier to the adoption of a more rational,
economics-based approach toward resource allocation is social. People have become
accustomed to thinking of computing resources as &quot;free,&quot; and may find even a
nominal charge objectionable. Users should recognize that the current system does
not make limited resources &quot;free,&quot; however, but instead exacts its pound of
flesh for using a congested web site in terms of
time (one of our most precious limited resources). Because time is valuable, every user should be willing to
pay something if that will significantly reduce his or her waiting for web
sites. Economic theory suggests that, if properly structured, rationing resources
by price rather than by having people wait in queues will, on balance, leave
people more satisfied. Further, during uncongested off-peak times the optimal
congestion prices will be zero, so users with very low values of time can
reallocate their usage in a manner that avoids monetary charges.
</P>

<P>The following subsections provide a critical survey of a number of
proposals for pricing Internet transport services. As a benchmark for comparing
these proposals, the discussion begins with the theoretical ideal of optimal
dynamic priority pricing. Then auctions (or smart markets), flat-rate pricing,
and voluntary declaration schemes are considered.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch03_ 12">
Ideal Economic Pricing Proposals
</A></H4>

<P>The economic foundations for optimal congestion pricing are deeply
routed, going back at least to Pigou (1928) and Vickrey (1969). To illustrate,
consider the classic case of a congested highway. The travel time between city A and
city B depends on the total volume of traffic. For simplicity, suppose each
citizen makes one trip per morning, but that some people have the option of
making their trip at non-congested times. Typically, travel time is an increasing
function of traffic volume and increases at a rapid rate as the traffic volume
nears the capacity of the highway. In deciding whether to travel during the
congested period, a citizen compares the incremental benefit of travel to
this incremental private time cost, and makes the trip if and only if the
former exceeds the latter.
