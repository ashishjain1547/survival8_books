<P>From the point of view of the entire community, however, the social
cost of travel time is the sum of every citizen's private time costs. If some
citizen decides to make an extra trip, the additional social cost is the extra travel
time born by all citizens, not just the citizen making the extra trip. Only
those citizens whose incremental benefit from traveling during the congested
period exceeds the incremental social cost should do so, and the others should
postpone their travel to uncongested periods.
</P>

<P>Hence, if the price of highway access is zero at all times, too many
citizens will decide to travel during the congested period, because they are not
facing the full social costs. The theoretical economic solution is to set the price
of highway access during the congested period equal to the incremental
social cost&#151;called the optimal congestion toll. Then, by comparing the
incremental benefit of travel with the total cost (congestion toll + private time cost),
each citizen will voluntarily make the socially optimal decision.
</P>

<P>In addition to achieving a socially optimal resource allocation for
the existing highway, socially optimal pricing provides correct signals for
evaluating capital investment decisions. Without optimal pricing, there is a
bias toward inefficient capacity. To see this, simply observe that, starting from a
free access policy, social benefits can be increased by implementing optimal
pricing without any additional capital investment, while under free access the
same increase in gross social benefits would require costly capital investment.
Further, with free access an additional million dollars of capacity will
generate fewer social benefits for two main reasons. First, the social benefits are
diminished by the congestion that accompanies increased demand. And second,
the distribution of the new capacity over the highway network will very likely
be inefficient. To see the last point, consider two bottlenecks, one near an
industrial site and the other near a shopping center. Because shopping trips can
be more easily spread over time, optimal congestion tolls could virtually
eliminate the congestion near the shopping center. Because of the relative inflexibility
of work schedules, however, considerable congestion would remain at the
industrial site. With optimal congestion tolls, the new capacity would be
concentrated near the industrial site, and with free access the new capacity would
be
</P>
<A NAME="PAGENUM-114"><P>Page 114</P></A>


<P>
spread over both sites, thereby producing less total benefits for the
entire community.
</P>

<P>A major impediment to congestion tolls for physical highways has been
the cost of administering such a system. Toll booths add considerable delay
costs to travelers, thereby negating the congestion-reducing benefits of the
tolls. Even when technologies are introduced to physical highways, costs of
setting up remote sensors in cars and roadway check points are substantial.
When addressing electronic highways, however, it is technologically feasible to
compute and assess charges with negligible administrative cost. Thus, the
Information Superhighway may be the first real-world instance in which
congestion tolls are practical.
</P>

Dynamic Optimal Pricing
</A></H4>

<P>This economic theory was first applied to computing environments by
Naor (1969), Mendelson (1985), and Pick and Whinston (1989). Stahl
and Whinston (1991, 1992) and Gupta, Stahl, and Whinston [GSW]
(1996) extended these single-server models to network computing environments
and investigated its practicality by using simulation. Subsequently, GSW
(1995a-c) applied their network models to the Internet.
</P>

<P>At the center of the GSW approach is a general mathematical
representation of a computing network, a model of price- and time-sensitive user
demand for services, and a stochastic model of traffic flows and buffers. It
shows that a socially optimal allocation of scarce network resources can be
achieved by imposing optimal priority pricing at each site of potential congestion.
The optimal prices depend on the traffic flow at the site, the size of the packets,
the priority class, and the social cost of time. The latter can be
econometrically estimated from the sensitivity of traffic to actual price and throughput
time fluctuations at the site. Gupta et al. (1997), for example, present a new
non-parametric technique for estimating users' value of time from usage data in
real time, and show that these real-time estimates are sufficiently accurate to
cause no significant loss in the social benefits of optimal pricing (using these
estimates) as compared to the benchmark case with perfect information. In
GSW,
</P>
<A NAME="PAGENUM-115"><P>Page 115</P></A>


<P>
a practical decentralized method of determining optimal prices in real time
is proposed. A simulation model is constructed that demonstrates the
feasibility of this proposal.
</P>

<P>In GSW (1995a-c), the simulation model is calibrated to represent
the Internet and to compare the historical free-access policy with the
theoretical optimal pricing (see fig. 3.5). This calibrated simulation suggests that
without effective management of the Internet (as provided by efficient pricing),
congestion and misallocation of resources could cost the economy tens of billions
of dollars of lost benefits per year. This same simulation also demonstrates
that the potential social gains of optimal pricing, if sought solely from
capacity expansion, could have a capital investment cost exceeding the social
gains. Thus, they argue that congestion is a very real concern and not just a
theoretical fine point.

</P>

<P>In the GSW vision, a typical user deciding whether and when to access
an Internet service would be presented with a menu of options including
the monetary cost and (when relevant) expected throughput time for each
option. The options would specify a priority class, and could also include a
security/anonymity level, minimum guaranteed qualities, and contingency
options such as &quot;submit the service request when the cost falls below $b.&quot; The
user would then select the most preferred option. A personalized smart agent
could
</P>
<A NAME="PAGENUM-116"><P>Page 116</P></A>


<P>
automate the user's decision process based on previously specified user
preferences. Frequently updated price and time information would come from
the user's access provider. Smart agent software could serve this function
also, gathering information from posted prices of transport providers and
network congestion status reports.
</P>

<P>The user would not receive a bill from each node and link of the
network, but would rather receive one bill from his access provider for the posted
price of that access provider for the service requested.
<SUP>*</SUP> In turn, the access provider would receive a bill from the transport providers to which it is connected
based on posted prices and actual usage. Each network transport provider needs
to keep accounts only for the adjacent providers to which it is connected, not
the individual users. In the vertical direction, each telecommunication
carrier (such as AT&amp;T, MCI, Sprint) need to keep accounts only for the
networks (such as PSI, AlterNet, ANS, and so forth) to which it provides IP
transport. This disaggregated pricing and billing approach mirrors the wholesale
pricing practices in most industries. Ultimately it is the responsibility of the
access providers to charge the user and to cover its costs vis-a-vis the transport 
providers.
</P>

<P>Capital investment decisions can be greatly improved by the imposition
of optimal priority pricing. First, as demonstrated in GSW (1995), imposition
of priority pricing alone may generate more benefits at much less cost than
the cost of capacity expansion. Second, without priority pricing&#151;because
the physical resource allocation is inefficient&#151;the observed congestion can be
a bad signal about which parts of the infrastructure should be expanded first.
By imposing optimal pricing first, the distribution of network traffic can
change significantly, revealing a different ranking of the bottlenecks. Thus with
optimal pricing, capital investment can be focused on projects that will
produce the greatest benefits.
</P>

<P>Although the general model deals with potential congestion anywhere in
a computing network, in practice the most likely sites of congestion are the
56-or-less kbps pipelines and modems to information content providers,
their LANs, and servers. Thus in the near term, while there is still excess capacity
on

the content of the data transported from many independent content providers.
