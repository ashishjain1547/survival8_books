<P>same product than another consumer with a lower income or no
immediate need. If sellers can distinguish between these consumers, they can charge
a higher price for the former and establish a lower price for the latter.
Group discounts or senior discounts are based on this principle which is an
example of third-degree price discrimination.
</P>

<P>Discriminatory pricing based on identification is called third-degree
price discrimination. In the absence of a means to identify consumers, sellers have
to rely on the incentives of each group to select an intended variety. This
condition is called the self selection or incentive compatibility requirement
(see section 8.4, &quot;Pricing Digital Products,&quot; for more detail). This means that
given optimal product choices, consumers will sort themselves out according
to product characteristics and a price schedule that reveals their preferences.
This scheme based on consumers' voluntary choices is called
second-degree price discrimination. First-degree
or perfect&#151;price discrimination refers to
charging individual prices for each buyer, which are usually determined by
the consumer's maximum willingness to pay.
</P>

<P>Discriminatory pricing should be used whenever possible because it
is always more profitable than uniform pricing (Phlips, 1983, p. 18). Not
surprisingly, price discrimination is a common practice. However, these
are usually second-degree price discriminations based on incentive schemes,
or third-degree price discriminations based on consumer groups. First-degree,
or perfect-price discrimination requires detailed consumer information, and
the ability to charge different prices for different consumers. Therefore, prices
are individualized to extract all individual consumer surplus and reselling
among consumers must be prevented. This possibility was once considered to be
only of academic interest, but the increasing availability of detailed
consumer profiles based on electronic transactions information greatly reduces
information uncertainty&#151;a major impediment to practicing perfect price
discrimination. Sellers are increasingly able to introduce individualized prices
through online price negotiation and auctions.
</P>

<P>In electronic commerce, the combination of three factors raises the
possibility of perfect-price discrimination. First, sellers gain detailed
information about consumer tastes. Second, products can be customized without
much
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-322"><P>Page 322</P></A>


<P>added cost. And third, consumers can be billed independently. In each of
these aspects, physical markets are highly constrained by transaction costs
consisting of information costs, product variation costs, and costs for elaborate billing.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch08_ 9">
Variations in Consumption Values: a Simple Case of Price <BR>
Discrimination
</A></H4>

<P>Discriminatory pricing does not necessarily accompany product
differentiation; it can be used independently as well. One requirement for price discrimination is the seller's ability to differentiate customers and charge
them individually by using, for example, identification cards or personalized
billing accounts. A demand schedule for a hypothetical product is shown in
figure 8.3. The demand schedule, curve ACB, is drawn by positioning all
consumers by their willingness to pay, starting from the highest point on the left to the lowest point on the right of the quantity axis.

<P>Figure 8.3 Consumer surplus and revenue.
</P>

<P>The demand curve shows that, at a price D ($10), for example, the
demand is at E, 20,000 units. If 20,000 units are sold at $10, the total revenue
is the area ODCE, which equals $200,000. While the 20,000th customer,
the marginal consumer, pays exactly the amount he is willing to pay, all others,
the inframarginal consumers, pay less than what they are prepared to pay. The
area ADC is the sum of the benefits consumers retain from this market. If the
seller has information about each consumer's valuation and is able to negotiate
the
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-323"><P>Page 323</P></A>


<P>
price with each, he can charge each consumer what they are prepared to
pay. For example, Alice who has the highest valuation at, say, $100, is asked to
pay $100. Otherwise, the seller refuses to sell while preventing all others
from reselling or sharing theirs with Alice. Also knowing that Bob has the
next highest valuation at $80, the seller demands $80 for Bob, and so on. In
this case, the area ADC is the potential gain for the seller who engages in
discriminatory pricing instead of using $10 posted price for all its customers.
Ordinarily the negotiation process and information gathering requirement
would be more costly than the extra revenue. But when the transaction costs
decrease significantly, discriminatory prices can be justified. Electronic
commerce appears to be one market where this is the case.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch08_ 10">
Product Matching
</A></H4>

<P>Whenever possible, sellers charge different prices for the same product.
Discounts for groups, children, students, and senior citizens are used to
increase demand without lowering the price for other groups. In this case,
discriminatory prices actually help serve more consumers and increase economic
efficiency and social welfare. But in most cases, products are differentiated
for specific consumer groups. If these differentiated products have different
prices due to cost differences, these prices are not discriminatory. However,
price differentials may not correspond to differences in costs. For educational
markets, for example, software vendors may intentionally disable certain
functions and capabilities of a program to distinguish these products from those for
non-educational markets. Despite the added cost of disabling the program,
products for educational markets are lower than their commercial
versions (Deneckere and McAfee, 1996). Dividing audience seats by sections in
a theater achieves a similar effect.
</P>

<P>In physical markets, the key to effectively segment the market with
differentiated products is knowing what one feature each group of consumers
wants that is not wanted by other groups. To prevent high-valuation customers
on the left side of the demand schedule from masquerading as
low-valuation customers on the right side of the demand schedule, sellers must be able
to
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-324"><P>Page 324</P></A>


<P>distinguish buyers through some means of identification. In both third-
and second-degree price discriminations, the power of the sellers is limited
and incomplete because they still cannot discriminate consumers within
each group.
</P>

<P>In electronic commerce, sellers may finally have the means to practice
first-degree price discrimination by which each individual buyer pays the
maximum price they are willing to pay. In order to achieve a complete
price discrimination, sellers must have control over four factors of transactions:
preference profile, product differentiation, personalized billing, and consumer
arbitrage. Product differentiation is not a fundamental requirement, but it does
reduce the resistance of consumers and regulators to discriminatory prices, and it
also prevents or minimizes consumer arbitrage.
</P>

<P>The control over preference profile means that sellers must know
what each customer wants. To date, market research and surveys have been
important aspects in product development and successful retailing. As society
moves from anonymous cash transactions to card-based payments and
electronic payment systems, sellers find it easier to collect information about
consumers' purchasing behaviors. In electronic commerce, this possibility is
magnified exponentially. But the possibility of gathering extensive personalized
information is not guaranteed in the future. Anonymous transactions lessen the
sellers' discriminatory power over consumers. To complete the sellers' market
control, the payment system must be non-anonymous to prevent one consumer
masquerading as another. Because consumers are becoming increasingly aware
and resistant to releasing private information, it is difficult to predict what kinds
of pricing regime will be prevalent in future electronic commerce. But with
the trend toward selling personalized products via subscription, there will be in
all certainty a heightened debate regarding consumer privacy and anonymity
in transactions and payments. At present, the debate revolves around the
privacy right, free speech, and other legal points of view. Instead, this chapter
focuses on the economic links between privacy and product selection as well as
price discrimination.
