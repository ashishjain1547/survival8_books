<P>Finally, note that the issue of privacy goes beyond devising legal or
market protection for personal information. As stated earlier, complete
anonymity depends on the trustworthiness of the third party who mediates a
message transfer or a transaction. Intermediaries, therefore, can introduce
proper measures to ensure consumer privacy. Secondly, privacy in transaction is
an important issue in electronic payment systems. Separate from the security
issue of protecting credit card numbers and the like, an added concern is
preserving the privacy of buying habits and other consumption-related information
when transactions are conducted using digital credit cards and digital
currency. Payment-related issues are examined in Chapter 10, &quot;Electronic
Payment Systems.&quot;

Consumer Information and Discriminatory Pricing
</A></H4>

<P>The effect of sellers' use of information about market behavior on
consumer welfare is important to consider. Sellers of information argue that it
reduces prices and enables consumers to buy better products because sellers
gain efficiency in production and marketing. These benefits are possible, but so
are other scenarios. Prices might actually increase, sellers may even refuse to sell
to certain &quot;identified&quot; customers, and only profitable types of products may
be marketed. The economic arguments against information revelation are
numerous, but the possibility of first-degree price discrimination based on
consumer information has largely been ignored.
</P>

<P>For some products, consumers voluntarily reveal their needs and
preferences. For others, reluctant consumers have raised the issues of anonymity
and privacy in transactions. Faced with informational uncertainty, the sellers
want to know consumer's private information as much as the buyers want to
know the quality of the product. But, a seller with consumer information may
set prices according to an individual consumer's marginal valuation rather
than the marginal cost of the product. If the firm does not restrict the
quantity, there is no loss in social welfare (the sum of the seller's and buyer's
surpluses). Indeed, unlike monopoly prices, discriminatory prices generally
increase market efficiency by expanding the market and allocating resources
according to consumers' marginal willingness to pay.
</P>

<P>From a distributional point of view, the gain to consumers may be
lower than the benefit to the sellers. Under perfect price discrimination, a seller
sells his product by charging the maximum price each consumer is willing to
pay. This may be socially efficient but consumers are seldom willing to pay
the highest price without complaint. Moreover, the firm may prefer to
restrict quantity or refuse to deal with some consumers based on their profiles. In
a sense, consumers lose their bargaining power by revealing personal
information to the firm.
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-345"><P>Page 345</P></A>



<P>If a buyer's identity is not revealed, the pricing strategy will usually
be conventional. For example, suppose Charlie sells an online magazine in
a market where there are only two consumers: Alice and Bob. Charlie
knows that one of them will value his magazine at $10, and the other at $5, so
the seller has only a general knowledge about the distribution of consumer
preferences and values. Also, suppose that consumers likewise are not sure
whether the magazine will be worth $10 or $5 prior to purchase. When
consumer identity is not known to Charlie, he can only price his magazine at $7.50,
the average price. Because that price is the average, both Alice and Bob are
likely to buy it at that price. However, one of them will be disappointed after
finding out that the magazine was worth only $5. This conventional pricing and
sale works if
</P>

<OL>
<LI>          The sale occurs only once


<LI>          Consumers do not know their valuation of the product prior <BR>
to purchase


<LI>          The seller cannot distinguish between its customers
</OL>

<P>If sales are based on repeat purchases, consumers learn product quality,
and either Alice or Bob will drop out of the market after the first bitter
experience. Then, Charlie can price its magazine at $10 and sell only to the
remaining customer. This higher price is only possible after consumers learn about
the product's quality or about their valuations of the product. Otherwise, if
the product is offered at $10 in the first period, no one will buy it because
the price exceeds the average valuation&#151;the amount both Alice and Bob expect
to get at the maximum.
</P>

<P>What is the benefit to the buyer if the buyer reveals private
information? Suppose Alice is the one with high valuation and Bob has the low
valuation. Then, it may be beneficial to Bob if Charlie is willing to charge a lower price of $5&#151;assuming that this price is still higher than the cost. On the other hand, Alice will not reveal her preference and pretend to be Bob, because she enjoys a positive surplus at $7.50 or at $5. Therefore, revealing private information is beneficial to consumers with low valuation. Those with high valuation must be given sufficient incentives to reveal their preference.
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-346"><P>Page 346</P></A>



<P>An ideal pricing scheme calls for charging Alice $10 and Bob $5.
To implement prices based on consumer valuations, Charlie needs to know
the identity of the buyer, and have a means to prevent Bob from buying
two copies and selling a copy to Alice at a price lower than $10 (this is
consumer arbitrage). The latter can be prevented if he sells only one copy to each
customer, but this requires the ability to identify and distinguish his customers.
In the absence of identifiable information, Charlie can only sell his magazine
at $7.50 for one-time customers, or at $10 and forgo part of the market
(again assuming that consumers know the product quality). The result is that Bob
is either disappointed (or enraged by a &quot;rip-off&quot;) or not served.
</P>

<P>In sum, by revealing their information, more consumers may be served
and products will be at their valuation. Similarly, discriminatory (or
differential) prices allow sellers to serve a larger market, increasing market efficiency. But,
as mentioned earlier, charging different prices involves some consumers paying
a higher price than in a market with incomplete information. Therefore,
sellers need some mechanisms to satisfy consumers who are charged differently.
One is differentiating products to persuade them, rightly or not, that they
are buying different products. If products are differentiated in a way to
segment the market, Alice will not pretend to be Bob in order to pay a lower price.
The next section continues this discussion and other strategic considerations
involving product choice and pricing.
</P>

<P>It suffices to note here that although the prospect of complete price
discrimination is great in electronic commerce due to the availability of
identifiable consumer information, many arguments can be made in favor of
allowing sellers access to such information. The previous example identified
two such arguments: consumers with different valuations can be served, and
products can be tailored to match differences in consumer tastes.
Furthermore, information on the market and consumers has a value of its own. If not,
there would be no incentive for market research. The value of market
information derives from its use in reducing uncertainty in the quantity and quality
demanded for a product. The reduced uncertainty helps formulate more
effective competitive strategies as well as regulatory policies. With an uncertain
demand, a firm's fixed investments may result in waste from idle
production
