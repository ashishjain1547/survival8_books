CHAPTER 8
</A></H3>

<H2>

Product Choices and <BR>
Discriminatory Pricing

</H2>

<P>Historical battles show that a policy of competition based only on price
is often ineffective because profits for all competitors are sacrificed as prices
are lowered in each round of struggle for market share. This is known to
economists as a Bertrand price competition result. Well aware of this, sellers
are constantly seeking out non-price forms of competition. This chapter
focuses on one form of non-price competition&#151;product differentiation. The
economics of product differentiation are first reviewed to help explain why
sellers differentiate products. Although product differentiation is observed in
physical markets, it will be more widely practiced in electronic commerce because
the transmutability of digital products makes them highly customizable
(see Chapter 2). Furthermore, detailed data on consumer preferences are
more abundant in computerized market environments. As a result,
consumers obtain a higher degree of satisfaction from customized products than
average-quality products, and prices can efficiently reflect costs and consumer
preferences. Efficient pricing strategies, such as multi-part tariffs and discriminatory
pricing, are improved by the combination of detailed consumer information
and customized products. The objective of this chapter is to present an overview
of product selection and pricing strategies for digital products, emphasizing
the significance of consumer information and privacy in transactions.
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-314"><P>Page 314</P></A>



<P>Next, this chapter investigates the sellers' product choices and
the customization of digital products. Customization is an extreme example
of product differentiation in which products are manufactured to match
the specific demand of a small group of consumers or even one individual.
Using examples currently found on the Internet, the effects of customization
on prices and consumer welfare are evaluated. For example, a high degree
of customization discourages satisfied consumers from reselling or sharing
their products. This is especially advantageous for products that can be
reproduced easily and allows sellers to set prices based on the consumers' willingness
to pay.
</P>

<P>To effectively customize products and charge individualized prices,
producers desired detailed knowledge of consumer preferences. In section 8.3,
the issue of privacy in transaction and the use of consumer information in terms
of product differentiation and price discrimination are examined. Although
the legal aspects of privacy and anonymity have received considerable attention
in the press and among professionals in the nascent field of electronic
commerce, this chapter focuses on the economic impact of the use of personal
information. This includes not only such obvious information as names, addresses,
and phone numbers but more importantly information about consumers'
tastes. Disclosure of personal preferences provides consumers with
custom-built products, but they may have to pay higher prices for them.
</P>

<P>Finally, various pricing methods for digital products are evaluated.
When products are differentiated, pricing strategies become extremely
complex because both product specifications and prices can vary according to
differences in consumer tastes and usage patterns. Product differentiation
and consumer information enable various sales mechanisms&#151;subscription,
licensing, renting, leasing, and bundling&#151;that exploit differences in
consumer preferences to control the usage of a product. While current pricing
practices are dominated by licensing (for computer software) and subscription
(for digital information products), other methods including
unbundling, customization, and need-based software distribution become possible as
new technologies such as applets and micropayments are perfected and more
widely accepted. The pricing and marketing of digital products indicates the
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-315"><P>Page 315</P></A>


<P>competitiveness and profitability of electronic commerce. Consequently,
this has generated many preliminary works in digital product pricing. Most
of these, however, do not consider the characteristics of digital products and
the electronic marketplace. This chapter extends these works by considering
the problem of quality uncertainty and its effect on the market.
</P>

<H3><A NAME="ch08_ 2">
8.1. Product Differentiation and Pricing in <BR>
Economics
</A></H3>

<P>In a standard economics price competition model, products sold by
competitors are assumed to be the same and homogeneous so that only prices
matter to consumers. If products are differentiated, however, each seller has
some degree of market power over those consumers who prefer their product. As
a result, sellers do not necessarily lose all sales even when prices for
differentiated products differ. This section reviews the economics of product
differentiation and examines how product differentiation relates to product selection
and pricing for digital products.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch08_ 3">
What Is Product Differentiation?
</A></H4>

<P>Differentiated products are classified in the same product group, yet they
are not identical. The various brands of breakfast cereal are an example of
product differentiation. Microsoft Word and WordPerfect are differentiated products
in the product group of word processing programs. Notice that Word
and WordPerfect are termed &quot;differentiated&quot; but not &quot;different;&quot; WordPerfect and
a breakfast cereal are &quot;different&quot; products (that is they belong to different
product groups). Another term that is often used with product differentiation
is product variety, which refers to the number of products (or brands) in
a product market. Note, product differentiation relates to the degree of
dissimilarity. Thus, product differentiation may increase if two products become
more dissimilar, while product variety remains the same.
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-316"><P>Page 316</P></A>



<P>Products are perceived to have a bundle of characteristics such as
weight, size, volume, color, and other qualitative measures such as performance
and easiness to use. Products in a group share the same characteristics, but each
has a varying degree of these characteristics. While products can be
differentiated in many ways if the characteristics dimension is complex, a useful
distinction commonly made is between horizontal and vertical product differentiation.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch08_ 4">
Horizontal Differentiation
</A></H4>

<P>Products are considered to be differentiated horizontally if the difference
is based on appearance or consumer preference. If consumers have
different tastes (for example, some prefer the color blue while others prefer red)
each differentiated product has a market share even when horizontally
differentiated products are equally priced. Imagine a product space where a location
represents the product's characteristics. Such a location model was first
introduced by Hotelling (1929). In figure 8.1, notice that firm A sells a product which
is bluer than that of the firm B, whose product is more red than blue. The
price of each product is represented by the vertical line. Consumers are
distributed along the same product space according to their tastes for color. The
location of Alice along with the continuum of consumer tastes indicates that she
tends to prefer a bluer product than Bob. However, neither Alice nor Bob gets
a product that exactly matches her or his preference because the products
are some distance away from their locations. The resulting dissatisfaction is
represented by the increasing slope of the total price line, which is added to
the product price. The cost of dissatisfaction, which is analogous to
transportation costs in spatial terms, increases as the distance from the firm (that is
factory specification) increases. Given the two products, consumers choose either
firm A or firm B based on the total price, which is the sum of the constant
factory price and the increasing dissatisfaction cost. Anyone whose taste lies to the
left of the market boundary, including Alice, buys from firm A. When firm
A raises its price slightly, its market share shrinks as the market boundary
moves to the left.
