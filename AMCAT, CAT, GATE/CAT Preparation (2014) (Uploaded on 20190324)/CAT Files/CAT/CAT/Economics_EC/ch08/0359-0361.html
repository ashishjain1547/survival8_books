<P>to their willingness to pay. Our discussion of incentive compatibility is
meaningless if the market consists of consumers with identical tastes. In this
case, one price for one product suffices and is determined by the market
demand. Many have observed that such simplified pricing strategies work well
for information products in physical markets. For example, newspapers charge
a uniform subscription price; cable operators charge one price for a bundle
of basic channels. However, prices for a newspaper differ between delivery
and vending, and discount prices are available for student and delivery plans.
Even cable service is increasingly divided into many tiers to reflect the diversity
in consumer tastes. The physical and technological constraints that have
largely influenced the way newspapers and cable services are sold will no longer
be paramount for digital products. Nevertheless, some pricing strategies used
in physical markets may be used in electronic commerce: for example,
leasing options, subscription-based pricing, and bundling techniques may be
employed.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch08_ 32">
Selling versus Renting Digital Products
</A></H4>

<P>A basic truth of marketing is that if the value of a product is much less
than the cost or price of the product, not a single consumer will be willing
to purchase it. Even in this case, sales are possible. In such a situation, a group
of consumers may form a club if each individual's share of the price and
the accompanying transaction costs, such as waiting time for one's turn, are
still lower than the price of the product. A club good is classified between a
pure public good and a pure private good (Buchanan, 1965). A pure public good
is one whose optimum number of users is all consumers in the market, while
this number for a pure private good is one&#151;here, individual consumption
is preferred. The optimum number of users in club goods is determined by
the marginal condition that the benefit of adding a marginal member must
be equal to the associated cost. When forming a club to share a product,
several factors must be considered: the group's benefit may increase by adding
a member (association benefits), the user cost may increase (congestion
effects), or the production cost (purchasing price) may be lowered (economies of
scale).
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-360"><P>Page 360</P></A>


<P>Association benefits are common in social clubs but not in private good
clubs, although a similar benefit is observed in pure private goods such as
computer software, which is called a network effect. Congestion effects are evident in the example of library books, where more members create more waiting for a turn to borrow. The economy of scale effect is simply the reduced per-member cost to purchase a book. Taking the price as fixed cost, this is quite similar to the case of declining average cost, which is not surprising because natural monopolies in utility industries are forms of clubs.
</P>

<P>When a product has a cost structure of this type or is prone to a
sharing arrangement, a viable club can be formed (see Sorenson et al., 1978), but
the seller may find it more profitable to arrange a sharing scheme himself
instead of selling directly to the consumers. A product sharing scheme initiated by
the seller, who maintains ownership of the product, is known as renting or
leasing. The objective is to discourage arbitrage by consumers and to avoid the
restrictions imposed by the first sale doctrine.
</P>

<P>A library is an example of a sharing mechanism by which consumers
who are not willing to pay for a book may still use it. Suppose that Peter is trying
to sell a book titled The History of Libraries priced at $20. If Alice thinks
that reading the book is worth more than $20, she will prefer to buy it.
However, Peter cannot sell it to anyone whose value for the book is less than $20. Still,
if there are 10 people who each considers the book to be worth $5, their
total valuation sums to $50. Suppose that the cost of sharing, in this case waiting
to borrow, is $1. The maximum price that can be charged for the group of 10
is $4. Peter can either sell two copies of his book at $20 each, or one copy at
$40 if he is able to separate the library from the retail market.
</P>

<P>Sharing arrangements are common when a product is used only once
and the quality of the product is not degraded. However, if a product is used
more than once, consumers may prefer to buy it outright, especially if the
sharing cost is high enough to justify the sale price because the total cost of an
alternative to buying includes transaction costs. For instance, for casual
reading, many depend on borrowing from a library, but they prefer to have their
own copy if they plan to read a book more than once. Because the cost of
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-361"><P>Page 361</P></A>


<P>borrowing from a library includes waiting time and the fact that one can
only use the book for a limited time, the sum totals of these transactions costs
and the sale price determine whether the consumer buys or shares. For
digital libraries, both of these transaction costs may be negligible unless
artificial restrictions for check-out and returns are imposed.
</P>

<P>Sharing or renting is often preferred by the seller even for those
whose valuation of the product exceeds the sale price. The reason for this has less
to do with the desire to exploit the residual market; controlling consumer
arbitrage is a important goal of the seller. After consumers buy a product, the
first sale doctrine allows them to do whatever they want with it. The first
sale doctrine means that a buyer may resell, rent, lease, or dispose of a product
at will after the purchase. Copyright protection only applies to copying or
reproducing the content of the book, and does not apply to selling the original
copy. In contrast, renting or leasing does not change the ownership of the book,
and here the first sale doctrine does not apply. In this case, the owner of the
book (the seller) may establish certain rules regarding its use. A very elaborate
form of such contractual restrictions is implemented by software licensing,
which not only controls how many persons can use a program but also how often it
is used in a given time period with the help of use-measurement software.
</P>

<P>For functional products such as software, licensing may be an
adequate method of maintaining ownership. However, as the complexity of
networks and computer usage increases, a more flexible licensing regime is
required. Although the number of licensed sites or users is relatively easy to
manage, there is no adequate method of monitoring access and time of usage.
Licensing terms are becoming increasingly complex&#151;an increasing number of
large corporations rely on third-party asset management firms to keep track
of software purchases, updates, and usage.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch08_ 33">
Subscription and Bundling
</A></H4>

<P>Bundling of computer programs is one of several factors that
complicates software licensing. Software vendors find it profitable to bundle
products, some of which are used only on a limited basis, because buyers are
often
