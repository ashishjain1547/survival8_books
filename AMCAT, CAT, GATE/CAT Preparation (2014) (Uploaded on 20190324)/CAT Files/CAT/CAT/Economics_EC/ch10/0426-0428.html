banks, who issue  digital certificates to be displayed on their web pages.
<BR>

<BR>During a transaction, consumers send the merchant their digital certificates for
payment. In a sense, the digital certificate is a digital credit card, which
merchants simply pass on to their banks for approval. The merchant certificate is equivalent
to the logos of accepted cards displayed in store windows. For more information,
see &quot;Internet Resources&quot; at the end of this chapter.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The dominant issue today in electronic commerce is security. The level
of interest indicates that most merchants and other participants in
Internet commerce are considering electronic payment systems based on
traditional systems such as NFTs. This is despite the fact that First Virtual's
payment system is much more secure, even without encryption technology, and
does not require heavy investment or costs for merchants to participate. The
fact that NFT payment systems simply extend the existing model of
physical markets seems to suit vendors who sell physical products on the
Internet, especially because consumers seem to prefer extended credit terms to
cash payments. This said, even with greatly reduced transaction costs, credit
card-based payments still are not suitable for small-value purchases. In
these instances, digital currency payment systems have the advantage.
</P>

<H3><A NAME="ch10_ 8">
10.4. Digital Currency Payment Systems
</A></H3>

<P>Whereas electronic payment systems reviewed in the previous sections aim
to adapt existing payment settlement processes to the open environment of
the Internet, digital currency, also called electronic cash or electronic money, is
a new development which has far-reaching commercial, monetary, and
regulatory ramifications. One of the ways payment systems using digital
currency differ from traditional electronic funds transfers is the transactional
contents. In traditional EFT and many electronic payment systems proposed
for Internet commerce, sensitive payment information (such as credit
card
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-427"><P>Page 427</P></A>


<P>
numbers or bank account information) is transmitted over the network.
For those transactions, the primary concern of businesses and consumers is
security. When security is breached, this information may be used without
authorization. But, swift counter-measures can remedy the situation. In the case
of digital currency, the monetary value is being transferred instead of
payment information. This is akin to sending a $20 bill in the mail. An
intercepted digital currency transaction, therefore, is equivalent to outright theft, and
the remedial measures needed are different from those addressing credit
card fraud.
</P>

<P>The primary motivation for digital currencies has been to preserve
the privacy afforded by cash transactions. Privacy can be protected somewhat
in non-cash payment systems by various encryption methods and trusted
third parties. A more salient feature of digital cash as a payment system is
the capability to make peer-to-peer transactions, either online or offline, in
which two persons can exchange money without involving a third party. In
this sense, digital currency is more than just an efficient electronic
payment system; it is a monetary innovation that deserves closer economic analysis.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch10_ 9">
Money as a Medium of Exchange
</A></H4>

<P>Money has many origins and forms, but to be a viable medium of exchange,
a monetary system must meet certain criteria. Primitive forms of money include
 virtually every type of goods with value, such as cash crops, cattle, and
ornamental and precious objects. These objects are used to pay tributes,
make peace offerings, compensate a bride's family, and fulfill other social
customs. While these primitive forms of money could be used as a store of value and
a means of payment, to act as a medium of exchange they need to be
widely available and broadly accepted, as well as convenient. Monetary objects
may have different uses, but an economic use of money as an exchange
medium needs to simplify the cumbersome barter system of physical goods.
</P>

<P>Coins or paper currency&#151;also called fiat money&#151;meet the criteria
of acceptability, availability, and convenience as a medium of exchange.
Precious metals, struck as coins, were commonly used as money until the 19th
century.
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-428"><P>Page 428</P></A>


<P>On the other hand, the origin of paper money goes back only to the
late Middle Ages, when bank credits were transferred in the form of bills
of credit, whose value depended on the issuer's credit worthiness. Until
quite recently, paper money was issued by private banks as well as
government agencies. In Canada, private banks were free to issue notes based on
their assets until the beginning of this century. Even in the U.S., no national
banking or currency system existed during the free-banking era prior to the
Civil War. Although they were ultimately backed by government bonds,
National Bank Notes had been issued by federally chartered national banks since
1863 under the National Bank Act. The National Bank Notes competed
with Demand Notes (also known as the &quot;greenbacks&quot;) and Legal Tender Notes
(also known as United States Notes), both issued by the federal government.
The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 phased out these privately issued notes
and replaced them  with Federal Reserve Notes by the late 1930s, but
privately issued currency had been common in the history of U.S. money.
</P>

<P>As the use of fiat money grew, it became possible to separate the role
of exchange medium from the role of storing value. Paper currency does
not have an intrinsic value other than the promise by the issuing bank or
government to convert it into another form of stored value on demand.
Ultimately, not even this convertibility is promised, and the value of paper money
depends solely on the implicit trust among the public and between the
public and the authority who issues the currency.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch10_ 10">
Inside Money and Outside Money
</A></H4>

<P>The amount of currency circulated today is quite small compared to
the amount of money that exists in demand deposit and savings accounts.
Even items of small value are purchased using debit cards and other
electronic devices, further reducing the need to withdraw and carry bills and
coins. Whereas coins and bills are exchanged physically to complete
transactions, notational money in currency-denominated accounts is simply
adjusted according to instructions given by affected parties. As the public's trust
in financial institutions grows, the money that exists in notation can be
con-
