<P>tions that might involve payment of a penny or less to view a web page. In
the case of digital currency, the level of transactional efficiency depends
on whether users need to interact with a third party to verify the
currency's validity, which increases costs. After verification, the intermediary re-issues
a new coin, making a digital coin in this scheme non-transferable.
Bypassing this cumbersome and repetitive process may compromise the level of
security against double spending or counterfeiting, or may require a secure
hardware platform, as in Mondex. Because encryption technologies are
adequate enough to support a high degree of security, systems such as Millicent may
be viable for high-volume, low-value transactions at minimal transaction costs.

Monetary Effects
</A></H4>

<P>Digital currency payment systems have raised macroeconomic questions
and concerns regarding their impact on the money supply and
governments' control over monetary policy. In the U.S., research has shown, however,
that the Federal Reserve system's control of the money supply can be adjusted
to reflect the change in the money demand, and as such government
officials consider the effect of digital currency on the monetary system to be
minimal (Blinder, 1995). Nevertheless, proposed digital currency systems may
affect the monetary system in two ways: they may influence the supply of money
by changing the money multiplier, or they may change, in the long run,
the velocity of money, affecting price levels and interest rates. The effect of
digital currency on the money supply depends on how inside monies are
created whereas its effect on the velocity of money is uncertain.
</P>

<P>To address these issues, you must first review how the money supply
is controlled by governments through central banks or, in the U.S., the
Federal Reserve. The money stock (M1) consists of currency and checkable
deposits held by the public. A larger definition of money stock (M2) includes
time and savings deposits and money-market instruments in addition to the
demand deposits included in M1. The public holds a portion of the currency
as cash and the rest in banks as checkable deposits. The ratio of currency
to</P>

<P>
deposits is called the currency-deposit ratio, which is about .4 in the
U.S.&#151;that is, $40 in cash is carried for every $100 deposit. Once deposited,
the

<P>bank can lend the money to a third person, who in turn holds some of
the money in cash and deposits the rest. The money supply is created
through this process of deposits and lendings.</P>

<P>In the U.S., the Federal Reserve (the Fed) controls the money supply
by changing the amount of currency in circulation and the bank's capability
to lend. The Fed controls the amount of currency by selling and buying
bonds through its open market operations. When the Fed sells (or buys) bonds,
it reduces (or increases) the amount of currency circulating. The Fed
also requires each bank to hold a portion of their money in cash or with
the Federal Reserve banks to meet the cash demand of consumers. The
resulting reserve-deposit ratio may be changed by the Fed, but is currently around
10 percent. This means that for every $10 of checkable deposits, a bank
must have a cash reserve of $1.
</P>

<P>The currency and the banks' deposits with the Fed are called the
high-powered money or the monetary base. The effect of the Fed's
monetary operations on the money stock involves the money multiplier, which is
determined by the currency-deposit ratio and the reserve-deposit ratio. The
money supply function can be expressed in the following equation:
</P>

<P>Money Stock=(Money Multiplier) &#165; (Monetary Base), where</P>

<P>Money Multiplier=</P>



<A NAME="PAGENUM-446"><P>Page 446</P></A>


<P>CD is the currency-deposit ratio, and RD is the
reserve-deposit ratio. This means that the total stock of money in the economy is 2.8 times greater
than the monetary base. The money multiplier and the stock of money can
be graphed, as in figure 10.11, using the money multiplier.
</P>

<CENTER>
Figure 10.11 The monetary base and the money supply.
</CENTER>

<P>Figure 10.11 depicts a situation in which an increase in the
monetary base, denoted as DB, increases the total money supply by DM. The
exact monetary effect depends on the money multiplier, which is DM/DB in
the graph. An increase in the money multiplier (a counter-clockwise
rotation around the origin, that is, steeper, for the money multiplier line) implies
that an increase in the monetary base causes a larger increase in the money supply.
</P>

<P>Ecash, e-money, or CyberCash systems essentially create new
currencies, but their effect on the money supply depends on whether they are backed
by the national currency. If Ecash, for example, is backed by
dollar-denominated currency accounts, inside (digital) money is exchanged with outside
(fiat) money. For example, suppose Alice withdraws $100 from her
conventional bank, deposits it with Mark Twain Bank's Ecash account, and converts it
into $100 worth of Ecash coins. If Mark Twain Bank does not hold the $100
but deposits it with another bank, or lends the $100 under the same condition
as any other bank, the supply of money does not change by Alice moving
her money to the electronic bank.
</P>

<P>However, say Alice withdraws $100 into cash to meet her need for
cash transactions. Such cash holding by a consumer represents a reduction
in demand deposits and the capacity to create money by lending
institutions. With Ecash instead of cash, Alice does not carry $100, which she
would normally have held for cash transactions, and therefore more money is 
available for lending by banks. In other words, consumers will hold less
cash and more deposits with the availability of digital currency, which
decreases the currency-deposit ratio and increases the money multiplier (by
reducing CD in the money supply equation). As a result, the overall money supply
will increase if Mark Twain Bank, or any escrow intermediaries that hold
backup outside money for digital currency, is allowed to operate as a lending
institu
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-447"><P>Page 447</P></A>


<P>
tion. The effect on the money supply will be even greater if Mark Twain
Bank is not subject to the Fed's normal reserve requirements and chooses to have
a lower reserve ratio. On the other hand, if digital currency issuers are
required to hold the dollar (outside money) in an escrow account and cannot lend
the deposit to a third person, the same amount of cash balance is held, either
in digital cash or fiat cash, with no effect on the money multiplier.</P>

<P>If, however, digital currency is not backed by dollars or any
outside money, digital currency is then simply a product whose price is
determined only by the supply and demand in the market, akin to holding foreign
currency in lieu of the dollar for cash transactions. Imagine that U.S.
residents are suddenly using Mexican pesos or German marks for everyday
transactions. Its effects on the money supply and the dollar interest rates deserve
a great deal of investigation. For example, suppose that residents in Texas
adopt a digital currency, which is not linked to the dollar, for their cash
transactions. Alternatively, suppose that members of the North American Free
Trade Agreement (NAFTA) integrate their economies while their currencies
are maintained separately, and Texas residents begin to use Mexican pesos
instead of dollars for grocery shopping. The dollar demand for cash will be
greatly reduced. To reduce the supply of dollars, the Fed may engage in open
market operations, for example, selling government bonds to the public,
thereby increasing its cash holding and taking cash out of circulation. U.S.
monetary officials claim that changes in the money supply can be adequately met by
the Federal Reserve System, through open market operations, whether or
not digital currency is backed up by fiat money. Nevertheless, if the Fed wants
to reduce the money supply as the demand for dollars decreases, it needs to
raise the interest rate to sell bonds. At the same time, people want to dispose
of their cash by buying bonds, so that the increased demand for bonds
will lower interest rates. The net effect of the Fed's open market operations
and the citizen's demand for bonds may very well offset each other to
produce stable interest rates. However, if the Fed's operations are out of sync,
temporary instability will have a significant effect on the economy&#151;as evidenced
by the stock market response to a quarter point increase in the interest rate.
