<P>To complete the correspondence between our physical world and
the future virtual world, digital identities will be created around persons instead
of around computers. Today, computers and servers are online personalities of
the Internet, with humans attached to them. For example, a typical
e-mail address is written as person@server.computer. Either the person's name or the
server computer address can change. This e-mail address is similar to a postal
address, in which building addresses are more or less fixed, while people move
around. Each person, however, is distinguished by some distinct and permanent
identification, such as a social security or driver's license number. A similar
identification can be given to individuals to establish online identity.
</P>

<P>In the physical world, a message cannot be delivered to a social
security number. The difficulty is not in finding a way to deliver mail using
social security numbers but in maintaining a database that links building
addresses with social security numbers. In the virtual world, an elaborate and
up-to-date name server will forward messages to appropriate online persons, no
matter where they are. Likewise, businesses and other economic entities can
establish online identities. This does not preclude people from using online
equivalents of post office boxes or aliases if they choose to do so, but a permanent
identity is essential for verification purposes.
</P>

<P>Both governments and private entities will provide these permanent
identities, just as identification cards are issued by governments, schools, and
companies. Multiple identification cards will all point to the same person, which
can be verified legally. Just as it is unlawful to assume multiple identities in
legal and commercial transactions, multiple virtual identities must be prohibited
in virtual transactions as well. As an extension to the physical identity,
virtual identities will be based on legal, permanent, and verifiable identities.
Legality need not be based on governments alone, however. Private certification
authorities will also run a centralized registering system to provide varying
levels of identity classes for different purposes. For the very reason aliases are
accepted (for example, for authors), multiple virtual identities will also be useful.

12.3. Components of the Virtual Economy
</A></H3>

<P>The virtual economy has as its foundation the virtual market, where
transactions occur in cyberspace. But nontransactional activities&#151;such as
advertising, consumer research, customer service, education, entertainment, and
politics&#151;are affected by the same Internet or online processes. With this in mind, let
us define the components of the virtual economy:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>       Virtual players: When buyers, sellers, or intermediaries establish
their online identities, they become virtual market players. This process
can be initiated simply by opening an e-mail account, being
connected online, or setting up an online shop, such as a web storefront.
Virtual players may be automated software agents, which&#151;on behalf of
their owners&#151;can search, gather information, negotiate, and process
orders. By using software agents, a person online can exist in many places
at one time, or one person can have multiple online identities: thus,
one person's multiple preferences can yield multiple online personalities.
On the other hand, a group of consumers or sellers may act as a
single entity. As we discussed in Chapter 1, &quot;Electronic Commerce and
the Internet,&quot; a virtual firm differs from a physical firm in both
organization and structure, and a virtual consumer behaves differently
online than offline.
<LI>        Virtual products: Product virtualization certainly includes
digitization, which converts products of text, graphic, video, and audio
components into digital files of ones and zeros; however, many
non-multimedia products are also digitized. For example, concept- and
process-based products, such as digital currency, tickets, and house keys, can
have digital counterparts. In this sense, digitization or digitalization
entails more than digital scanning or remastering to change the physical
characteristics of a product; it also refers to a creative conversion based
on the way a product is used. Products that cannot be digitized can
be made into smart products by attaching suitable technological
devices. Some examples are smart electricity meters, home security
devices,
</UL>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-552"><P>Page 552</P></A>

<UL>
traffic signals, and automobiles, which are networked via
microwave and satellite links. By using online commands, home electricity
usage can be controlled from office or hotel rooms or an e-mail message
can be sent to the automobile to be picked up at work or the airport.
Automobiles, house furnaces, and other smart products will have
virtual interfaces that will interact with people&#151;a process called
product virtualization. Virtual products, therefore, include a far greater
number of physical products than is conventionally assumed.<BR>

<LI>      Virtual processes: The term &quot;virtual processes&quot; refers to the way
market players interact with products and other players, usually via
interactive and real-time communications. Establishing online ordering and
payment procedures is a necessary first step in enabling virtual
market processes. But non-transactional interactions will become more
important in such areas as the supply-chain management process,
product development using direct consumer inputs, and advertising based
on detailed consumer profiles and negotiations with consumers.
The overall impact of virtual processes goes far beyond achieving a
more efficient transaction; they will fundamentally alter production
processes, consumption, and virtually all aspects of economic activities.
Furthermore, online transactions are changing the way taxes are collected
and government regulations applied. Worldwide transactions challenge
not only the international system of tariffs and income taxes but also
the very theory of international economic growth and cooperation. In
sum, virtual processes mean more than interactivity or real-time
communications, which are characteristics of underlying technologies. Instead,
the importance of virtual processes lies in the transformation they cause
in the relationship between the interacting parties.
</UL>

<P>Computers, software, and telecommunications infrastructures form
the arena where virtual players interact with each other and exchange
virtual products. The virtual economy is the game being played in that arena.
The rules of the game are being refined from experience, while the layout of
the court changes as the need arises. Some players are not even sure what game
is</P>


<A NAME="PAGENUM-553"><P>Page 553</P></A>


<P>
being played today, while others are forming teams and establishing goals
for the game to be played tomorrow. At the moment, the game seems
deceptively similar to the one we have been playing all along; in other arenas, it is
unclear to some why the game would ever change. Yet others point out
fundamental differences, one of which is the convergence among products and industries.
</P>

<H3><A NAME="ch12_ 5">
12.4. The Convergence
</A></H3>

<P>The virtual economy, by its very nature, facilitates&#151;and in some ways
requires&#151;convergence in products, processes, infrastructure, and market
space. Convergence is a process by which products and producers considered to be
in different markets suddenly find themselves in the same market. If very
broadly defined, all digital products may be said to be competing with each
other. Because their businesses all center around computer technology and
information products, content providers such as television program producers
and multimedia CD-ROM manufacturers are in the same market with
network software and communications equipment vendors, but convergence cannot
be defined so broadly. Telecommunications firms are not in the same market
with online publishers, although their activities may depend on each other, just
as mail-order booksellers depend on the services of post and parcel
carriers. Similar intermarket dependence has often resulted in a mistaken belief
that computer operating system software is in the same market with, for
example, e-mail programs or Internet browsers (see section 11.9).
</P>

<P>Convergence, even when defined rather narrowly, is still pervasive
enough to characterize many aspects of the virtual economy. Four major types
of convergence will appear by the year 2015:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>      Product convergence. Digitization, for example, has made it
unnecessary to distinguish among different forms of products. Audio
CDs, pictures, and magazine articles all take the same digital format and
can be edited or searched by the same processing software. This is
