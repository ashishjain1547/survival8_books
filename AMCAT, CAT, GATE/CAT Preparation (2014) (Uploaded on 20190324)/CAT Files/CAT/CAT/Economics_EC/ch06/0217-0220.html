<P>
Newspaper Association of America <a href="http://www.naa.org">
(http://www.naa.org)</A>, a trade
association for newspaper publishers, a third of online newspapers made money in
1996. A similar trend is forecast for online versions of traditional media
newspapers within four years. Over half of newspapers now have staff dedicated to
online production and sales.

<P>Advertising revenue figures are based on the conventional definition
of advertising: the payment of sponsors whose ads are displayed to web
browsers. Web pages are sprinkled with more and more tiny electronic billboards to
grab the viewer's attention&#151;just as printed advertisements and commercials
work for newspapers and television. Although this type of &quot;conventional&quot;
advertising is gaining a more ready audience in the World Wide Web universe,
the Internet also offers other advertising mechanisms, including topical and
for sale newsgroups, mailing lists, web links, and e-mails. Web storefronts
also serve the same function as advertising. The expenses spent on these are
not included in most ad revenue estimates, which might be even higher than
the $200 to $300 million estimated for 1996. The other channels of online
advertising include postings on related newsgroups and mailing lists, junk
e-mails, and selling advertisements directly to consumers.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch06_ 4">
Types of Internet Advertising
</A></H4>

<P>A fundamental consideration in Internet advertising is finding ways to
distribute information to consumers or inducing consumers to visit web sites.
When firms solicit customers, however, such activities are regulated under
various statues governing disclosure, liabilities, and truth in advertising.
Therefore, what constitutes advertising on the Internet is an important issue to be
settled in the near future.
</P>

<P>The Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) Bureau of Consumer
Protection, for example, recently forced Apple Computers, Inc. to offer $599
bargain upgrades to its customers who purchased entry-level Performa models;
Apple's advertisements had given a false impression that the upgrade would be
inexpensive and timely. The upgrade was so expensive that it equaled prices of
a new computer. To protect consumers from such instances, the FTC
monitors
</P>
<A NAME="PAGENUM-218"><P>Page 218</P></A>


<P>
and evaluates advertising activities. Does product endorsement on
newsgroups constitute advertising? Should the FTC scrutinize all types of
newsgroup postings, web links, e-mails, and so on? The Federal Drug Administration
has strict rules on how drugs are marketed. Should product information pages on
a pharmaceutical firm's web page be treated as advertising? Can one of its
employees mention its products on a chat line or post information on a
mailing list?
</P>

<P>The dilemma shows how diverse advertising channels are in the
electronic marketplace. The conventional definition of advertising does not include
the more subtle ways of soliciting business on the Internet, such as:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>          Endorsing and reviewing products on newsgroups by firms and
customers
<LI>          Soliciting listings from search services
<LI>          Soliciting and exchanging web links
<LI>          Providing product-oriented mailing lists and e-mail updates
<LI>          Web storefronts, which can be no more than a standing
advertisement for a firm
</UL>

<P>Currently, the main channels of online advertising consist of banners
on the World Wide Web and e-mailings. A more significant development
in online advertising is selling advertisements to consumers directly and
indirectly. The following sections review some of the issues regarding these
main channels.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch06_ 5">
Banner Ads
</A></H4>

<P>There are two pressing issues regarding banner ads on the Internet.
First, several studies are under way to clarify how effective banner ads are as a
marketing mechanism. Banners are bandwidth hogs that delay downloading
and frustrate web users. Some advertisers are reluctant to pay fees based on
the number of consumers who see the ads (impressions), but insist on
measuring &quot;click-throughs&quot; (that is, consumers must actually click the banner ad and
visit
</P>
<A NAME="PAGENUM-219"><P>Page 219</P></A>


<P>
the firm's web site). On the other hand, many consumers tolerate banner
ads to avoid paying for contents; some studies argue that they are effective
even without click-throughs. Section 6.4 discusses the question of
advertising effectiveness.
</P>

<P>The second issue relates to the lack of standards regarding size,
placement, and fees for banners. Although there is no compelling need for
standardization, some factors favor standardization. The
Internet Advertising Bureau (IAB) and the Coalition for Advertising Supported Information and
Entertainment (CASIE), a trade association for advertisers and advertising agencies,
for example, argue that standardized banners will simplify production and 
placement of these ads, reducing costs and setting an industry-wide basis
for calculating ad rates. Whether rates should depend on the size, layout,
or technologies involved must be determined through dialogs among
advertisers and ad carriers. The IAB/CASIE proposal has been endorsed in 1997 by
the Newspaper Association of America <a href="http://www.naa.org.">
(http://www.naa.org).</A>
</P>

<P>Because e-mailing has become the hottest use of the Internet, &quot;junk 
e-mails&quot; have been filling e-mailboxes. Junk e-mails are compared to
phone solicitation and junk mails but with a fundamental difference: recipients
of junk e-mails usually have to pay to receive them. Although recipients
can delete e-mails they do not want, downloading e-mails requires connection
and storage costs. Furthermore, junk e-mails may &quot;bomb&quot; one's mailbox,
effectively disabling e-mail service. To the extent that junk e-mails hinder one's ability
to use the service, they resemble sending advertisements via fax machines.
Several states, including Nevada, California, Virginia, and Connecticut, are
considering measures to make sending junk e-mails a misdemeanor. Considering
that recipients are forced to pay for something they don't want, legislative
response has been surprisingly slow. Rather, junk e-mails are countered by anti-junk 
e-mails and complaints made to account administrators.
</P>

<P>Unlike Post Office mails, e-mail advertisers might never be able to pay
the entire cost of sending an e-mail. An alternative is to pay recipients or to
compensate them with other services. This approach seems to be gaining
wide support in the online community.
</P>
<A NAME="PAGENUM-220"><P>Page 220</P></A>



<H4><A NAME="ch06_ 6">
Selling Advertising to Consumers
</A></H4>

<P>The conventional wisdom is that advertisements cannot be sold to
consumers. To many, advertisements and commercials are eye sores and intrusive
messages to be tolerated only for such reasons as lowered costs (of newspapers and
TV programs). A new trend in electronic commerce, however, is converting
advertisements into a commodity that can be traded at a price. The mass media
acts as a brokering mechanism between advertisers and consumers, where the
price of advertising is often difficult to measure. In contrast, the Internet has
opened up a means to sell advertisements to consumers through either bartering
or direct sales.
</P>

<P>Indirect bartering is still a transitory way of selling advertisements.
Consumers are offered free e-mail service or Internet access in return for
revealing their preferences, which service providers use to assign and send
advertisements. Because their revenues come from advertisers, these services are
basically in the same league with search services with advertisements. There
are, however, minor differences. Although search services use technologies to
learn consumer preferences, sometimes surreptitiously, these services are based
on voluntary revelation by consumers. Secondly, consumers enter into a
contract with service providers, bartering the value of services offered with
advertisements. In the process, consumers develop a clear notion about the value
of advertisements. An added benefit for consumers is the permanency of their 
e-mail addresses, which ordinarily change as one switches service
provider, school, or employer. Many e-mail services forward messages to a user-chosen 
e-mail account, allow users to choose unique domain addresses, and
provide protection from junk e-mails and other services (see table 6.2). In
comparison, can anyone expect to choose an individual telephone number, to carry
the same number for life, and to be protected from pesky telemarketers? Using
the same forwarding principle, these services can also direct web users to a
permanent web URL.
