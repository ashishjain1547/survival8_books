<A NAME="PAGENUM-235"><P>Page 235</P></A>


<P>
consumers who have no information about products and prices. Suppose
also that product information is conveyed only by advertising.
</P>

<P>In the market with perfectly informed consumers, there can only be
one price for an identical product. Otherwise, firms charging a higher price
would lose all customers. In the market with uninformed consumers, however,
firms can charge any price they want as long as consumers do not search for
price information. After some consumers start to visit other stores and
compare prices, the market will consist of informed and uninformed consumers.
Most real markets are this type of partially informed markets in which either
consumer search or advertising provides information about prices to some but
not all consumers. It is generally not possible or economically efficient to
inform all consumers because of the costs involved or because some consumers
will not receive information willingly or miss it by accident.
</P>

<P>Among informed consumers, advertising may raise or lower the level
of absolute prices depending on the strategy. When advertising highlights
relative price information, prices tend to go down as low-price firms become
known and it becomes easier for consumers to compare prices. When advertising
is persuasive rather than informative, however, the goal of advertisers is to
manipulate demand for their products and to increase their market power. As
a result, persuasive advertising helps firms to raise prices. For this reason,
persuasive advertising that emphasizes brand recognition and the image of a
product is much more common than informative advertising. For some
professional groups, such as physicians and lawyers, informative advertising with
relative price information is often prohibited to maintain high prices, although
the basis for such prohibition is often to ensure quality.
</P>

<P>The question at hand is whether persuasive information for digital
products is effective in the electronic marketplace. Considering that an
author's point of view is an important aspect in selling literary works, news, data,
and other information products, persuasive advertising may actually end up
being the mainstay in advertising digital products. Furthermore, because the
information about a product is often the product itself, persuasive advertising
may be preferred to detailed product description.
</P>
<A NAME="PAGENUM-236"><P>Page 236</P></A>



<P>Sellers may have to take into account, however, the fact that some
consumers will start to comparison shop despite the efforts of persuasive
advertising. In a situation in which consumers are partially informed, many prices
can coexist for a product. Those who cater to informed customers will charge
a uniformly low price. On the other hand, uninformed consumers can
be charged different prices. Consider informed consumers to be natives
and uninformed consumers to be tourists. The price for natives is lower than
that for tourists because natives are more familiar with the market. As more
consumers are informed (become natives), the two prices become closer and
the degree of price dispersion is reduced. Because advertising and searches
by consumers are costly, however, there will always be some
non-advertisers charging higher prices, which can be lowered only if all consumers
become natives (informed consumers).
</P>

<P>Who corresponds to natives and tourists on the Internet? Natives are
those who are fully informed about sellers, products, and prices, whereas tourists
are not informed for any number of reasons. In a geographical model, tourists
may be unfamiliar with local merchants and stores. In other words, tourists
must pay higher costs to find out prices. On the Internet, the difference
between natives and tourists may lie in their ability to search and navigate the
electronic marketplace. In this respect, an easy user interface such as the web
technology has reduced the technological barrier for some to enter the marketplace
and has turned many tourists into natives. Nevertheless, as long as the
technologies are cumbersome, difficult to master, and expensive, the electronic
marketplace will not be so efficient as to avoid dispersed prices altogether. Also,
dividing consumers into separate groups by limiting their access based on their
classification naturally enables sellers to separate them into natives and tourists.
In this sense, proprietary networks favored by some sellers create
artificially separated markets with the potential to increase prices.
</P>

<P>A corollary to advertising's effect on product prices is the efficiency
effect of advertising. By providing consumers with product information,
advertising improves market efficiency by lessening the search costs and facilitating
seller-buyer matching. When the price or product information is not provided
by
</P>
<A NAME="PAGENUM-237"><P>Page 237</P></A>


<P>
sellers, for example, consumers have to incur the search costs by
reading newspapers or visiting stores. Thus, when firms provide advertising, the
total price paid by a buyer is lowered by the amount of the consumer search
costs. The overall efficiency of a market with advertising is higher if the firm's
advertising expense is lower than the sum of all consumers' individual search
costs, which is more than likely in most cases. Thus, when advertising is
informative, its economic effects are unambiguously beneficial. Advertising can be
wasteful, however, if it is purely of a persuasive nature, creating non-existent
differences in products. As a preemptive strategy, advertising in its extreme may
erect barriers to entry, lowering the level of competition and raising prices.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch06_ 13">
Advertising and Product Differentiation
</A></H4>

<P>Informative advertising is most desirable when products are differentiated
and consumers find it difficult to select the ones that best fit their
preferences. Chapter 8 discusses product differentiation in more detail. This chapter
summarizes only the effects of advertising on product differentiation. Products
are said to be &quot;vertically differentiated&quot; if all consumers agree on which product
is better. If two products differ in terms of quality, for example, all
consumers will want a higher quality product if the two products are priced the same.
If two products have the same quality but differ only in color, however,
some consumers will prefer red whereas others will prefer blue even when the
prices are the same. The latter is a case of &quot;horizontal product differentiation.&quot;
</P>

<P>For horizontally differentiated products, informative advertising enables
a consumer to find a product that best matches his or her preference.
A consumer's preferences can be graphed as locations in a spatial market or
city. The distance between the locations of a firm and a consumer represents
the difference between a product and the consumer's preference. Therefore,
an advertisement about a product's location (that is, specification) helps
the consumer find out which product is closer to one's location (or taste).
</P>

<P>The obvious incentives for firms to convey product information to
consumers are the increase in sales and the reduced demand elasticity due
to consumers' knowledge that competing products do not offer a better
match.
