<P>Even generic theft statutes are found to be irrelevant in the case of
unauthorized copying. Again, theft involves physically taking an object, the
remedy to which may be recovering that object. Copyright, on the other hand,
does not protect the property itself, but rather the interest of the authors,
especially the market or profit interests. If a book is stolen from a publisher's
warehouse, for example, property laws governing theft or stolen property may apply,
but pirated copies are not theft protected by generic theft statute. Instead,
the violation is termed &quot;infringement&quot; of the publisher's interest protected
by copyright. This difference is illustrated by the fact that although stolen
property is recovered, pirated copies are destroyed. It is important to recognize
that, economically speaking, intellectual properties are not properties&#151;as
tangible commodities&#151;despite the misleading term, and intellectual property laws
do not protect the said property, but the interests of the owners derived from
the use of that property&#151;although this interest may very well be termed as
&quot;property&quot; in the legal sense.
</P>

<P>When does the proprietary right to an intellectual activity and its
pecuniary rewards become an issue? Stealing property, such as a theft, is an
economic concern because the owner is deprived of its use by which someone else
benefits. Suppose that Alice has a plow, and Bob steals that plow to plow his
land. During Bob's plowing, Alice is deprived of the use of that plow, and
perhaps loses her crop by missing the planting season. Bob's gain is Alice's loss.
Suppose, however, that Alice invented a plow attachment that makes
plowing much easier. Bob, after seeing how the attachment was made and
attached, makes his own device and gains the same benefit from reduced labor. Alice
in this case is not deprived of using her own idea on her own land.
</P>

<P>Further suppose that Bob opens a business selling plow attachments.
Does Bob owe some monetary remuneration to Alice? Today, the answer is a
resounding yes&#151;assuming that this plow has the same impact as it did
then&#151;but the idea of &quot;selling ideas&quot; did not exist until the Modern era. Protection
of private property rights over intellectual activities is not an issue if there is
no opportunity, now or ever, of making a profit or if there is a reasonable
method of controlling reproduction and selling. During the Middle Ages, Bob or
no
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-180"><P>Page 180</P></A>


<P>
one else would have thought of selling plow attachments as a business,
and innovations of many types were copied and stolen by others without regard
to intellectual property rights. (Keeping them secret was one way of
controlling ideas, to deprive others of their benefits.) Some ideas, even when not
kept secret, could not be copied. Even after printing presses revolutionized the
book trade and brought copyright issues to the forefront, for example, the same 
issue was mostly irrelevant to painters and paintings, which could not
be reproduced easily.
</P>
<P>The first known copyright theft occurred when Hermodorus copied
Plato's speeches and sold them overseas (Gurnsey, 1995). Was this a crime? If
there was a law prohibiting speech transcription and selling, Hermodorus
might have been a criminal. But the fact that there was no such law indicates
that Plato and his compatriots did not recognize a potential for profit in selling
the speeches. What limited the market for speeches was the lack of suitable
technology for producing copies. Even during the Middle Ages,
&quot;unauthorized&quot; hand-copying was an important part of monastic life. The primary utility
of these literary works was to communicate ideas to readers. Disseminating
ideas through hard-working monks was more important than any profit
consideration of the authors.
</P>

<P>When Gutenberg's printing press changed the publishing industry in
the 15th century, a larger market began to appear for printed works. With
mass printing, the profit potential from mass marketing was recognized and,
almost immediately, some works were &quot;popular&quot; enough to be pirated. The idea
of proprietary ownership was quickly extended to copies as well as to 
the original manuscript&#133;hence the term &quot;copyright.&quot; At this time,
however, the property right was applied to bound copies of books, and publishers
rather than authors controlled legal rights over publication and distribution.
</P>

<P>This is logical if one considers that books and copies were perceived to
be properties of trade, and that the first copyright laws aimed to regulate no
more than the trade aspects of book publishing. The Royal Charter, for
example, given to London-based Stationers' Company in 1557, granted a
monopoly right to publishers. The Royal Charter was a precursor to modern
copyright
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-181"><P>Page 181</P></A>


<P>
laws and established the &quot;property&quot; aspect of printed works. Once
registered and printed, a book became the property of the publisher. In this way,
what the Charter protected was the market, or the profit-making trade. The fact
that books were based on intellectual activities was not yet a consideration.
Despite the growing recognition of authorship rights and the importance of
knowledge and ideas, modern copyright laws still maintain this aspect of trade regulation.
</P>
<P>The monopoly, however, broke down as the demand for books and
regional piracy increased substantially and the market regulation based on
the Charter became ineffective and was abandoned. By 1710, publishing and
book trading was an important profit-making activity, and interested parties
demanded statutory protection of their rights to secure markets for their
properties. England's Statute of Anne in 1710 laid down the first terms of
copyright, limited its application to 14 years, and set out infringement penalties.
Although the statute also professed to protect impoverished authors during
the Age of Enlightenment by signaling the assertion of their rights, the statute
met with vigorous piracy originating in Scotland and Ireland&#151;and later in
Australia and the U.S. after copyright law was expanded to Scotland and
Ireland. This prompted a series of copyright laws that modified and strengthened
the terms of copyright protection. The benchmarks of copyright history
outlined in figure 5.1 show that a growing market and potential for rewards has
always been the driving force behind the struggle for copyright protection. It is
also important to remember that illegal copies became an issue only when
reproduction technology became sufficiently advanced. The invention of
printing presses, photocopiers, and now digital copying technologies have
periodically brought the issue to the forefront. But the market environment has
not changed significantly, and the digital marketplace does not present any
new issues that demand a complete revision in intellectual property laws as
some have argued.
</P>

<P>Since the Statute of Anne, three major developments have occurred
in modern copyright laws. First, the intrinsic rights of
authors have become increasingly recognized. Although the Royal Charter and the Statute of
Anne established authors' rights, they were geared more toward protecting
publishing houses from pirates.
