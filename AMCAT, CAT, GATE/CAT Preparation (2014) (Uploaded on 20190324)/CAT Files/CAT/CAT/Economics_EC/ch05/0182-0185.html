<P>Second, the recognition that foreign market piracy is a substantial
economic issue has resulted in international copyright agreements. The
Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (the
Berne Convention) was established in 1886 and its most recent revision (the
1971 Paris text) is administered by the World Intellectual Property
Organization (WIPO) <a href="http://www.wipo.org.">
(http://www.wipo.org).</A> A work copyrighted in one country is
also protected in other countries by the Berne Convention, as long as these
countries are signatories to the Convention. There are other international
copyright agreements including the Universal Copyright Convention (UCC),
which allows signatory countries to specify formalities such as copyright notice
and registration. Although the U.S. was the primary advocate for the UCC,
this and other agreements are overshadowed by the Berne Convention and
the WIPO.
</P>

<P>And third, modern laws have extended their protection to all types
of intellectual properties to include paintings, musical scores,
photographs, recordings, and performing arts. Since knowledge became the most
important economic asset during the Industrial Revolution, the attempt to
balance private property rights against public benefits to stimulate economic
development have frequently resulted in clashes between the right of the author
and the goal of economic progress.

<H4><A NAME="ch05_ 4">
The Authorship Aspect of Copyright
</A></H4>

<P>After an idea is attached to a physical object, for example when it has been
set down on paper, establishing the ownership of that object is a legal
question that most legal regimes are quite accustomed to dealing with. Throughout
the history of copyright laws, the ownership right to an object to which an idea
is attached has been a far less contentious issue than the question of
authorship right to an idea. When one wrote down public speeches of Plato, for
example, the manuscripts belonged to the transcriber, not the author, Plato. The
former could legally duplicate and sell the speeches. Historical records do not in
fact show whether the author or the government objected to this practice or
recognized the issue of authorship at all. When authorship is not asserted,
copying speeches could by no means be considered an act of theft.
</P>

<P>Due to the property aspect of intellectual properties, copyright laws
have evolved as a trade regulation. Intellectual properties have characteristics
unlike other physical properties, however, and accordingly copyright laws are
enforced differently. Damage awards for copyright theft, for example, are
based on actual and potential market loss inflicted by the theft, not the recovery
of the stolen property itself. In fact, as mentioned previously, stolen
property&#151;that is, unauthorized copies&#151;is destroyed, not returned. More
importantly, ideas and knowledge have so-called public goods characteristics, where
the social gains may outweigh the private gains if freely available. At an
extreme position are those who believe that ideas cannot be possessed, confined,
or exclusively appropriated. As Thomas Jefferson said, &quot;inventions cannot
in nature be a subject of property.&quot;
</P>

<P>As a result, the current debate on copyright protection in the
electronic marketplace mainly centers on whether authors have the moral right to
control every aspect of their works, or whether the public have the right to access
this information. A clear understanding of this issue is needed before one
can evaluate various positions on copyright protection in electronic commerce.
</P>

<P>Modern copyright laws accept the premise that authors who
provide content should be rewarded. This represents the changing view that the
main
</P>
<A NAME="PAGENUM-184"><P>Page 184</P></A>


<P>
emphasis in providing copyright protection is not just &quot;protecting the
market,&quot; but &quot;creating incentives.&quot; Although the right of authors was relatively 
inconsequential in early copyright laws, in the 18th century countries
in Continental Europe began to advocate natural and moral rights of creators
as inalienable rights. In today's age when the expressive medium is no
longer limited to paper and proprietary characteristics have become uncertain,
authorship of an idea takes on even greater significance.
</P>
<P>Although proponents of authorship emphasize maximizing authors'
rights by controlling all aspects of intellectual properties, this goal contradicts
the professed goal of intellectual property right laws to promote society's
welfare, and often faces difficulties in collecting payments. A sale of a book entitles
the buyer to rent, resell, and give it away as he or she sees fit, even though that
will prevent the content owner from selling another copy. Because copyright in
the age of printing was primarily a property law pertaining to physical books,
the first sale doctrine applies to a sale of a book even though the content
owner does not transfer the copyright through the sale. Even when there is no
dispute regarding payments, copyright holders often lack means to monitor
and control such activities. ASCAP and BMI, for example, rely on a
complex formula to determine payments for copyright holders, because counting
every instance of broadcast and performance of a copyrighted work is
impossible. Digital technologies and the electronic marketplace give content owners
means to control and monitor every aspect of consumer usage. As a result, the
desire to control copyrights often coincides with the intent to maximize
authors' moral rights that give content owners unrestricted control over their
creations. New technical means to expand copyright control, however, face
challenges from various uses of copyrighted works considered to be &quot;fair&quot; and a
benefit society as a whole.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch05_ 5">
Public Interest
</A></H4>

<P>The expanding scope of copyright based on moral rights of authors is
not always consistent with some purposes of copyright law. The public
interest aspect of intellectual property rights, for example, was set forth in the
U.S. Constitution's mandate to &quot;promote the progress of science and useful
arts,&quot;
</P>
<A NAME="PAGENUM-185"><P>Page 185</P></A>


<P>
which became the basis of granting exclusive rights to inventors and authors.
It reflects the recognition of the importance of authorship and intellectual
activities in ensuring a society's progress. To promote this goal is to
acknowledge that information and ideas have the characteristics of public goods. The
transfer and dissemination of copyrightable materials&#151;that is, change of
ownership&#151;is clearly in society's best interest. To encourage productive
activity, authors do need incentives such as profits, but keeping ideas out of
circulation due to an overly rigid system that is highly unproductive. Therefore,
modern copyright laws have become far more than trade regulations; they also
attempt to act as incentive mechanisms that balance private and social interests.
</P>
<P>In its role as a mechanism regulating business practices, the protective
and regulatory aspects of copyright law are mainly concerned with the
business aspects of reproducing and distributing the physical product. As an
incentive mechanism, however, copyright law carefully selects what it does and does
not protect.
</P>

<P>First, works containing no original authorship are not protected.
Therefore, commonly known facts, lists, or tables cannot be copyrighted. A
later section discusses the implication of this for databases, which often contain
a collection of facts. Second, a fair use is not a copyright infringement. A fair
use is specifically permitted to avoid a rigid application of a copyright statute if
it stifles other intellectual activities such as criticism, comment, reporting,
teaching, or research. A rigid application of moral rights to digital products
will compromise society's need to foster intellectual activities, not to speak of
the right to free speech. New copyright regimes, therefore, must continue
to balance incentives for both private and social objectives. Furthermore,
new copyright regimes should not be restricted to legal definitions of what
copyright is and is not. To circumvent the first sale doctrine, for example,
software vendors use licensing rather than sales so that the vendors rely on
contractual laws rather than copyright laws for protection. Although legal ramifications
of copyright and contract laws may differ, the market is the same and needs
a consistent legal framework. This at the least demonstrates the need for
a broader incentive mechanism that can deal with all modes of &quot;selling&quot;
digital products.
