Economic Aspects of Copyright<BR>
Protection

</H2>

<P>Intellectual property laws are typically linked to a discussion of the values
of intellectual creativity and society's use of information and ideas.
Nevertheless, they are fundamentally economic measures and their implementation
and enforcement can and indeed should be evaluated in terms of their
effectiveness in achieving desired market changes. This chapter attempts to do just that.
The ultimate end of intellectual property laws is to promote the creation of
knowledge and useful arts. This goal, however, cannot be achieved without
incentives, which most often are economic. This chapter examines the issue
of digital copyright by focusing on the law's intention to protect the market
for copyright owners. Therefore, any measure to enhance digital copyright has
to be evaluated in terms of how well it accomplishes this. Nevertheless, far
more than the use of legal and artificial market barriers, this chapter advocates
the essential role of strategy in resolving the copyright debate.
</P>

<P>The most efficient allocation of resources is obtained when markets
are competitive&#151;in other words, when prices are determined by demand
and supply and fully reflect the cost of producing a good, its opportunity costs,
and society's valuation for the good as well as other uses of the same resources.
To achieve maximum efficiency, the market forces must not be inhibited
by external measures such as taxes, artificial barriers to entry, and other
measures
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-176"><P>Page 176</P></A>


<P>
that affect the level of market power of either sellers or buyers. Copyrights
and patents seem to directly contradict this by giving authors and inventors
a limited monopoly right over production and distribution of a good. Why
then is there the need to give artificial monopoly rights to authors?
</P>
<P>The need to protect intellectual properties to the extent that
competitive market mechanisms are abandoned has less to do with the fact that
society values creativity so highly but because ideas, once discovered and put
into words and other physical forms, can be easily copied, often without
incurring additional effort and time. To those who believe that human creativity
belongs to humanity or society, this is an added advantage that makes
disseminating ideas easier. In an age of information, however, producing ideas has
become the most important economic activity, and ideas consume enormous
resources and time to produce. In other words, ideas and intellectual properties
have become investments that must be remunerated.
</P>

<P>Disseminating ideas is desirable and necessary for the prosperity of
a society. Teaching a new and improved farming technology to neighbors,
for example, increases overall agricultural production without restricting
the inventor of the new method from reaping benefits on his or her own land
by using the same technology. Although ownership of physical properties such
as land must be clearly defined to prevent inefficient use, intellectual
properties are often more valuable if shared. After ideas are written down in
physical forms that are then traded, however, the ownership right of an idea and
its physical manifestations in various forms becomes an economic issue, first
set forth formally in the copyright legislation of the 16th century.
</P>

5.1. Economic History of Copyright
</A></H3>

<P>Copyright is a by-product of the mass printing process, improved literacy,
and market incentives for profits. Its statutory specifics have historically evolved
in
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-177"><P>Page 177</P></A>


<P>
the context of the book trade, emphasizing the &quot;property&quot; aspects over
the more &quot;intellectual&quot; perspective. In today's age of information and
digital products, many fear that copyright laws formulated to regulate the book
trade are grossly inadequate, pointing out that digital media are
fundamentally different from the paper medium in both production and distribution. As
the printing press forced society to re-think intellectual properties four
centuries ago, the digital communication again compels a reevaluation of the
purpose and practice of copyright laws.
</P>

<P>In an effort to continue to protect authors' rights in the digital era,
new technologies and tools are being developed specifically to control digital
communication. The development of a comprehensive implementation scheme
for digital copyright, however, must grow out of the overall purpose of
such measures, and will be judged by its effectiveness in fulfilling any
agreed-upon function of copyright law. To better understand the rationale for
copyright protection, this discussion reviews how two strands of thought
regarding intellectual properties&#151;property rights versus authorship rights&#151;have
developed along with the modern publishing industry.
</P>

<P>The property rights approach sees the objective of a copyright law
as guaranteeing market and revenues for authors and thereby promoting a
continuous supply of high-quality products. Followers of this approach
regard current copyright laws to be adequate, and focus on developing new
technological means of auditing, identifying, and measuring digital flows
accompanied by vigorous enforcement of the laws.
</P>

<P>On the other hand, the authorship rights approach considers the
fundamental function of copyright to be protecting authors' moral rights to
their creation, so a stricter mechanism is needed to control all aspects of
viewing, storing, retrieving, altering, reproducing, and transmitting their
creations. Whether these products are marketable is immaterial. Followers of this
approach believe in redefining copyright for digital products and modifying
or strengthening copyright statutes.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch05_ 3">
The Property Aspect of Copyright
</A></H4>

<P>An idea, knowledge, or intellectual activity as an economic property is
a relatively modern invention. It is quite clear that laws governing property
give an owner the exclusive right to possess, use, and transfer property and
other objects connected to or derived from that property. But although
physical properties such as an acre of land or a house can be clearly defined, what is
an intellectual property? To establish property rights, one needs to first identify
a) the owner and b) the property. The owner of an intellectual property is
the author. But because of its intangible nature, ownership cannot be
established over an idea, and thus property rights are awarded to the physical expression
of the author's idea such as a book.
</P>

<P>Despite being called &quot;property,&quot; intellectual properties are obviously
quite different from tangible properties, and therefore legal protection and
prosecution based on copyright law are substantially different from other
property laws. This difference was highlighted in the computer hacker case of
U.S. v. Riggs in 1990 (Godwin, 1994). The prosecution tried to apply the
ITSP&#151;Interstate Transportation of Stolen Property (18 U.S.C. 2314)&#151;statute to
a computer hacker who made an unauthorized connection to a regional
telephone operating system, copied its emergency 911 procedure, and
distributed it, ultimately publishing it in a magazine. Instead of applying copyright
or trade secret laws, the prosecution used ITSP statutes, mistakenly believing
that property theft law also applied to intellectual properties. Admittedly, ITSP
was wrongly applied; a law governing trade secrets&#151;against which federal and
state criminal laws have been enacted or modified to address online cases&#151;or
wire-frauds might have been better suited.
</P>

<P>The Supreme Court had previously stated that copyrighted material
does not meet the scope of ITSP, however, which applies to tangible items. In
the case of copying a computer file, there is no physical seizure of an item
or transport of that good. Simply put, the emergency 911 file was left on
the host's computer, and only a copy was transmitted. In this way,
unauthorized copying is substantially different from a theft protected by ordinary
property statutes.
