<H4><A NAME="ch11_ 6">
Product Differentiation and Size
</A></H4>

<P>Economies of scale operate where products are homogeneous or if
consumers regard different products as essentially the same. In some cases, products
are homogenized especially to take advantage of the
economies of scale. For example, Ford's Model T in the 1920s maintained a low price because the
automobile manufacturer relied on mass production of only one model. As the
market for automobiles grew, different models were offered that still benefited from
the economies of scale afforded by increased sales&#151;up to a certain ceiling. A
specific car model may cost more if it is produced beyond, say, 300,000 units, because
of the physical limitations of its manufacturing facilities.
</P>

<P>This ceiling on economies of scale may not apply to digital
products, which may not exhaust the economies of scale regardless of the market size.
In this case, where the average cost would continue to decline ad infinitum,
it would be better business sense to have one version of a product.
</P>

<P>Some economists, observing the reproducibility of digital products,
seem to feel that this infinitely declining average cost implies that companies
will steer away from incurring the high cost of investing in new products.
According to them, digital products are affected by economies of scale,
interoperabil-ity, and standardization, all of which favor a dominant product instead
of many competing products. As a result, in their view, consumers will be
forced to accept a Model T of any digital product because it is most efficient.
</P>

<P>In our view, consumer tastes differ, and products will be differentiated
to match consumers' preferences regardless of the efficiency. Just as mass
production technology&#151;whose main objective is to minimize production
costs&#151;was the essence of earlier industrial development, recent computer-assisted
manufacturing technologies have introduced the capability for customized
production of physical products, say, automobiles, at a far smaller number
with extreme model variations. Digital products, due to their
transmutability, represent a further departure from mass production of a single average
product. In addition, differentiated and niche market products can be
marketed more efficiently on the Internet through targeted e-mailing, newsgroups,
and
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-468"><P>Page 468</P></A>


<P>
discussion lists, as well as through direct consumer participation in
product development. As a result, the conventional economic model, in which
firms with declining average costs compete by lowering prices, will apply only
when products are substantially homogeneous or substitutable.
</P>

<P>When products are highly differentiated, producers possess a degree
of market power over their market segment. To secure such market
segments, smaller firms and individuals can rely on qualities that have little to do
with the size of a firm or initial investment. For example, the value of point of
view and authority in commentaries and intellectual works cannot be
adequately represented by conventional economic modeling about costs. Having a
point of view that is valued by consumers is not a simple function of fixed
costs, such as years of education or experience. Given these other considerations,
the dominance and the reputation of a firm in electronic commerce may
not depend solely on the size or the initial investment, and producers of
niche market products may taunt the prevailing economies of scale in the
electronic marketplace.
</P>

<H3><A NAME="ch11_ 7">
11.2. Search Service and Its Market Implications
</A></H3>

<P>As mentioned earlier, the Internet is often touted as a means for firms
large and small to improve their efficiency. However, efficiency in the
electronic marketplace is critically dependent on efficiency in search activities. In
physical markets, consumers learn about products and locate sellers through a variety
of methods ranging from advertisements, word of mouth, directories and
references, and pure chance. In contrast, the vastness of the virtual
marketplace works to isolate consumers because of the lack of
immediate space. Consumers cannot simply pass and remember stores while commuting to work. In
the absence of this, search engines and online advertisements are key to
helping consumers navigate the virtual marketplace.
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-469"><P>Page 469</P></A>


<P>Chapter 7 discussed several inadequacies of Internet search services
in terms of completeness, accuracy, relevancy, and objectivity of information.
For example, no complete listing of all Internet resources exists, and search
information is often out-dated because the World Wide Web is changing
constantly. However, the heated debate about the role of search services
revolves around two other aspects: the use of consumer information and the
commercialization of search services. Section 11.5, &quot;Digital Products and Pricing,&quot; 
discusses in more detail the policy aspects of the availability of
consumer information versus consumer privacy. This section explores the critical role
of search services in market efficiency.
</P>

<P>First, to be efficient, search services or their databases need to
remain objective and public. Although commercial services can provide
objective information at the lowest possible price by including advertisements,
proper attention should be given to the possibility of introducing unnecessary
inefficiencies under this advertiser-supported model of business. To understand
this better, you can review examples found in mass media and advertising.
</P>


<H4><A NAME="ch11_ 8">
Advertising in Broadcast Media
</A></H4>

<P>Television and newspapers rely on paid advertisements because it is difficult
to charge customers based on their usage and valuation. Because media
companies cannot distinguish frequent TV watchers or newspaper readers from
the occasional audience, there can only be one price for all consumers. In the
case of television, broadcasters cannot even locate their customers to bill
them individually. As a result, television programs are often considered similar
to public goods for which adequate pricing mechanisms are hard to find. To
solve the problem of billing, television broadcasters are in the business of selling
to advertisers; the (paying) customers of  TV broadcasters are not the
audience but the advertisers; and their products are TV-watching
consumers, not TV programs. In this way, two separate markets&#151;TV programs and
advertising markets&#151;are combined via the intermediary role of broadcasters (see a.) in
fig. 11.1). This peculiar business arrangement is not due to the characteristics
of television programming or program consumption, but rather to the
way</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-470"><P>Page 470</P></A>


<P>
television signals are carried over the air. Today, cable television gives
broadcasters the capability to control their signals and monitor usage. In this case,
as depicted in b.) of figure 11.1, the two markets can be separated.
Nevertheless, the practice of advertiser-supported programming continues, even
when consumers pay for subscription.</P>

<BR>
<a href="javascript:displayWindow('images/ch11fg01.jpg', 246, 160)"><img src="images/tn_ch11fg01.jpg"></a><BR>
<P>Figure 11.1 TV broadcasting and advertising.
</P>

<P>One primary argument in favor of advertising in all broadcast media is
the lower resulting price. Newspapers with advertisements would cost more,
if they were able to exist at all, which might prevent many readers from
subscribing. The quality of television might suffer if broadcasters could not rely
on advertising revenues, again if they were able to exist at all. But, the
argument that consumers get high-quality free products because of advertisements
is weak on two accounts. First, these products are not free because
consumers pay in the form of watching commercials or reading advertisements, for
which no adequate compensation is paid. Second, television programs are
manufactured to maximize audience&#151;the number of eyeballs sold to
advertisers&#151;not to satisfy consumers' preferences. As a result, TV programs usually cater to
the lowest common denominator&#151;sex and violence&#151;to maximize audience
size. Program line-ups also reflect the need to maximize audience flow from
program to program, and the need to dominate the ratings game when
advertiser-sponsored audience measurements occur during the sweeps period.
