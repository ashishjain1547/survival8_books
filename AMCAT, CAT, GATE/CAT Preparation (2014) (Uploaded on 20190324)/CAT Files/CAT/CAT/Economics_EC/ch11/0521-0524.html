<P>Therefore, widgets are overproduced&#151;an inefficient resource
allocation&#151;if you do not consider its externality (negative in this case).
</P>

<P>Again, suppose that a home-builder considers how many trees to
plant. Suppose that the market value of each home increases by $3,000 if it has
trees. At $100 per tree, the home-builder plants 30 trees. However, neighbors
may benefit from the trees' shade and the neighborhood's increased home
values; say these benefits are worth $500. Therefore, an optimal number of trees is
35 instead of 30 if the home-builder considers the externality of planting
trees (positive in this case). Instead, trees are
underproduced because the home-builder has no means of charging his neighbors the added cost of $500.
</P>

<P>Because externalities bring about these inefficiencies, you need to
counter externalities. For some externalities, the solution is to define property
rights more clearly. If the cost of pollution is clearly defined, the widget factory
may be required to pay $10 for each unit produced. If the home-builder can
appropriate the benefit of tree planting, or be compensated for the cost, he will
plant an optimal number of trees. If computer software has positive network
externality (a benefit to its users), the program will be underproduced unless
the producer can appropriate such benefit in terms of revenue. The
economic concern stems from such solutions often being impossible through
market processes.
</P>

<P>On the other hand, if a market price already reflects the price of an
external benefit or loss, no externality problem exists. For example, a computer
OS may have a positive externality in that its value increases as more people
use the same product. This can be represented by an upward sloping
benefit schedule for consumers (see fig. 11.3), indicating that the average
consumers' willingness to pay (WTP) increases with more users. Given the firm's
marginal cost schedule, an optimal number of product is Q1, with the price of P1, if
the firm can charge consumers for the benefit from network externality. If not,
the output is reduced to Q2, with a lower price of P2, that corresponds to
the willingness to pay without network externality. At P2, the marginal cost
is below the true consumers' willingness to pay, indicating that the product
is underproduced.

<H4><A NAME="ch11_ 36">
Network Effects versus Network Externalities
</A></H4>

<P>After you become clear about network externalities, you must
distinguish simple network effects from network externalities. If market prices fully
reflect the cost and benefit associated with an externality, no economic concern
exists. For example, if market prices efficiently determine the level of air pollution 
or the number of trees planted, what we call externalities are no longer
externalities. Still, market size has some sort of effect, and such effects are
often called network effects to indicate that these effects do not result in
market inefficiencies.
</P>

<P>If the price of OS software or an application program is raised to
extract most or all of the benefit associated with network externalities, the
market needs no intervention. Similarly, the dominant position of such a product,
or its desirability, should not be explained by network externalities. Instead,
what appears to be the result of network externality may be due to economies
of scale (Liebowitz and Margolis, 1995) or anticompetitive behaviors.
When comparing prices in the computer hardware market, the OS market, and
the applications software market, many perceive that network externalities are
also
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-523"><P>Page 523</P></A>


<P>
behind the dominance of a player in all these markets. Simply put, prices for
a PC drop as more people use the Windows OS. In addition, Windows
has more application programs because more people use Windows, and so on.
The market is invariably dominated by a vertically integrated firm or a
multi-firm regime, such as the Windows-Intel platform. These arguments
indiscriminately apply network effects to different industries. That is, network
externalities between different products (often termed as
indirect network externalities) are mostly network effects, not externalities (Liebowitz and Margolis,
1995). These network effects across different products are hardly distinguished
from anti-competitive behaviors that impose artificial connections such as tie-ins,
or exclude downstream competitors from accessing upstream products that
one monopolizes.</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch11_ 37">
Anticompetitive Behaviors
</A></H4>

<P>A dominant firm should not use its position in one market to influence
other markets. For example, application programs need to interoperate with
OS software, which may be dominated by one firm. Through
anticompetitive behaviors, the dominating firm may extend its market power into the 
application software market. While governments cannot prevent the firm
from entering related markets, this case may fall into the category of illegal
tie-ins prohibited by antitrust laws. Often, such tie-ins are practiced as bundling
of vertically related products. For example, Microsoft as a dominant firm in
OSs tries to dominate the web browser market as well. If Microsoft uses its
market power in OS to advance its interest in the web browser market, the
company certainly appears to be a monopoly. However, enforcement efforts are
often discouraged due to the need for interoperability, standardization, and
network externality, which compound understanding of what constitutes anti-
competitive behaviors in digital product markets. This section, provides
an example of how interrelated digital markets may be analyzed to
understand firms' behaviors in these markets.
</P>

<P>Microsoft sells many application software products, including web
browsers in addition to OS programs. By bundling this software with Windows
OS,</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-524"><P>Page 524</P></A>


<P>
and using various means to make it difficult for consumers to use
non-Microsoft applications, Microsoft tries to extend its monopoly market
power of one market (OS software) into the applications market.</P>

<P>It is often argued that the scale economy in computer software, rather
than monopolization, explains the bundling and the dominance of Microsoft.
That will depend on the extent of the economy of scale in that product market,
but is highly unlikely as was previously argued. Alternatively, some argue that
a need for standardization and interoperability works to favor integrated
software, such as Microsoft's bundles, which are also integrated with the
Windows OS. But as argued earlier, there is no apparent reason why the need for
standardization or interoperability between an OS and an application
program should give one firm substantial advantages over others. In other
words, Microsoft Word and WordPefect have equal opportunities in the market
for word-processing programs, just as different VCR manufacturers have. If
one program enjoys network externalities, its price must be higher than the
other to reflect its true value. If one is more convenient with the Windows OS,
it may indicate a lack of true interoperability and standardization. A
monopolist in the OS market must provide all application software vendors equal access
to its standards and specifications necessary to run any application on its OS.
The monopolist is what is known as the common
carrier.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch11_ 38">Common Carriers and Microsoft
</A></H4>

<P>In telecommunications industries, the concept of common carrier is
well-known and accepted by market players and regulators. For example,
suppose Alice operates the only licensed magazine stand in Our Fair City. Suppose
also that her stand is the only location all citizens can access. Bob and
Charlie produce magazines that can be distributed only through Alice. Alice, in
this example, acts as a conduit for contents created by the publishers. The
selection of magazines on her stand is entirely up to her. She considers the number
of magazines she can accommodate, and each magazine's popularity and
profit margins. However, she cannot perform certain acts. For example, Bob may
try to influence Alice not to carry Charlie's magazine by offering a higher
