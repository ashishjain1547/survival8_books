<P>Figure 11.2 Monopolist's output decision.</P>

<P>At the Qm level of output, consumers' willingness to pay (Pm) is
still greater than the cost of producing the product (MC). Thus society will
be better off if more resources are allocated into this industry to increase the
level of output until marginal cost and marginal benefit are equal. At Qc, for
example, consumers are willing to pay Pc, which is equal to the marginal
cost, but the firm will only break even because the price equals the cost.
Comparing the zero-profit levels of output and price (Qc, Pc) with those of
monopoly (Qm, Pm), the monopolist firm clearly produces too little and sells the
product at a price higher than does a competitive firm.
</P>

<P>For many physical products, this scenario's implications are
straightforward. However, computer software and many digital products with
network externalities do not allow ready applications of this monopoly model.
For example, if Microsoft is a monopolist in the market for OS software,
then Microsoft must be artificially restricting its output to raise price. A
more competitive Microsoft would have produced far more units of Windows
and other assorted operating systems. But, is Microsoft not selling enough
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-518"><P>Page 518</P></A>


<P>
products? That doesn't seem right. Rather, the problem, as far as regulators
and its competitors are concerned, is that Microsoft dominates the OS
software market&#151;that is, the company sells too many.</P>

<P>This paradoxical result can be explained in several ways. Three
explanations follow regarding the market position of Microsoft and its market
impacts. These summaries also apply in general to most computer and
high-tech industries.
</P>

<UL>
<LI>       No Market Power: Output restriction occurs after the firm
achieves market power. The firm in figure 11.2 is assumed to have
monopoly market power. In other words, it can restrict output and raise price
only because it does not face competition. Microsoft, on the other hand,
still faces competition despite its dominance (producing roughly 80
percent of operating systems for desktop computers). Consequently,
Microsoft's dominance does not result in lower output and higher price, as
would be expected with a monopoly.
<LI>       Scale Economies: Figure 11.2 assumes that the firm has an
increasing marginal cost. Instead, computer software generally has a
decreasing marginal and average cost because of its high fixed cost and
extremely low duplicating (variable) cost. In other words, the average cost
of production decreases as more products are sold. An efficient level
of product in such a case enables one firm to produce all necessary
output to achieve the maximum economies of scale. Competing firms
unnecessarily duplicate fixed costs and result in waste. Therefore,
Microsoft's dominance in OS software is an efficient result owed to the
characteristics of the software industry.
<LI>        Network Externalities: There are network externalities by
which consumers benefit from having one standard product. With
network externalities, the value of a product rises as more people obtain the
same product. Therefore, the more the merrier. Microsoft's dominance
simply is a manifestation of network externalities that relentlessly drive
the computer software industry to standardization and dominance of a
few successful firms.
</UL>


<A NAME="PAGENUM-519"><P>Page 519</P></A>


<P>The first argument of no market power proposes that Microsoft's
market dominance does not have the  problems associated with the standard
monopoly. Despite its market share, Microsoft faces fierce competition
from Apple's MacOSs, IBM's OS, and Unix-based OSs. Monopoly rents
(higher profits) will be gained if no competition exists. But there is no evidence
that Microsoft is in a position to raise prices because of present and future
competition.
</P>

<P>However, Microsoft's market power should be determined in the PC
clone market rather than in OS software. OS software is useless without a
platform on which to run. For that matter, a computer is also useless if it does not
have an OS. Therefore, Microsoft is a player in the PC clone market. It may
seem that fiercer competition exists in the PC market, in which no one firm
commands more than 25 percent of the market. Because of competition, a
PC's price is assumed efficient. This might be true in terms of hardware
prices. However, PC buyers must also buy an OS, such as Windows 95, which
commands a monopoly price. If this price were lower, more personal
computers would be purchased. Consequently, monopoly problems exist in the
PC market, in which the level of output may be well below the socially
efficient level. Monopolistic components of a PC include the OS software as well
as microprocessors dominated by Intel. Despite cost savings in many PC
components, the PC's price is still prohibitively high for the majority of the
population. The reason? Monopoly market power of Microsoft and Intel.
</P>

<P>The second argument regarding economies of scale was discussed earlier.
In short, the average cost of computer software may not be declining due
to rapidly increasing nonproduction costs. Contrary to the assumption
that software prices may be zero because of the scale economy, giving away
these programs may very well be an act of dumping and predatory pricing.
</P>

<P>Finally, network externalities, or economies of the network, seem to
promote monopolistic computer software firms, which behave like
telephone services. As more people use Windows on their computer, for example,
its popularity feeds on itself, making Microsoft an unwilling monopolist. It
is argued that Microsoft's market dominance is due to network economies of
its</P>


<A NAME="PAGENUM-520"><P>Page 520</P></A>


<P>
products, and it is often more efficient to have only one firm producing such
a product than to have many firms competing with similar products.</P>

<P>Analyzing this argument requires considerable effort because the
term network externality is used indiscriminately in today's popular press and even
in academic journals. The term is often used in connection with
interoperability, standardization, and economies of scale. All these concepts relate to some
type of market incentive that drives the market toward a single dominant
product as consumers benefit from its dominance&#151;leaving an impression that
market positions of Microsoft and other computer-related giants are somehow due
to the nature of products, not their anticompetitive behaviors. Network
externalities seem to suffer the most abuse. Thus the following section focuses on
this problem.</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch11_ 35">Externalities and Their Effects
</A></H4>

<P>To define network externality, we must begin with the term externality.
An externality is a feature of a product that has no market price. Its price cannot
be determined because there is no clear way to define ownership of the
product, or sometimes to define the product itself. An example is air pollution from
a factory. Because air is not owned, the price or cost of polluted air cannot
be determined. Therefore, air pollution is an externality. Another example
is shade associated with a large tree. The tree's owner cannot determine its
shade as a product (because it is created by the sun), nor charge for it in any
marketable way. Note that shade is external to trees, which have prices determined
in the market. In a sense, an externality is a part of the characteristics of a
product, which nevertheless cannot be priced in the market.
</P>

<P>Externality is an important economic concept because it distorts
the market result. An efficient market employs resources up to a point when
their marginal costs equal market prices. Suppose that an air-polluting
factory producing a widget has a marginal cost of $50 without considering the
pollution. Suppose 10,000 customers want to buy the widget at $50. However,
if the cost of pollution is included, say $10 per widget, the widget's cost
becomes $60. At that price, fewer than 10,000 customers will buy the widget.
