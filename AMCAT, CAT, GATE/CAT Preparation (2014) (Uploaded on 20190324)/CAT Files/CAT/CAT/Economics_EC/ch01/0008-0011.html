<P>While the level of performance guarantee for the Internet is lower
than that for private networks, the chance for a catastrophic failure is lower for
the Internet compared to a private network that is controlled and administered
by a central authority. A message traveling on the Internet will be rerouted if
a part of the Internet fails. At the same time, eavesdropping on the Internet
is not targeted or specific, as in the case of private networks. Since private
networks carry designated information over the same network, the result of
a security breach will be more severe than on the Internet, where message
packets travel in mixed jumbles. When the next generation of Internet
standards are implemented along with content-level encryption, the security of
the Internet may become a concern in mostly isolated instances.
</P>

<P>While security and reliability will significantly increase in the next
generation Internet, its ever-increasing traffic due to multimedia, real-time,
and broadcasting applications may not result in any noticeable improvement
in terms of network congestion. More efficient compression technologies,
faster modems, and larger pipelines will certainly increase the absolute size of
the Internet bandwidth. However, cheaper and more abundant integrated
circuits and powerful microprocessors have been overwhelmed by concurrent,
or outpacing, increases in the demand for computational power. Similarly,
congestion may become a more critical issue in electronic commerce than
network security problems that have worried many prospective online marketers.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
From its beginning in 1969 as ARPAnet (Advanced Research Projects Agency of the
U.S. Defense Department), connections to the Internet have been based on open standards
to provide flexibility and robustness in order to maintain communications capability
even under a catastrophic disaster or a serious system failure in some of the network's
component computers.
<BR>

<BR>As the Internet grew into a network of networks, no single computer or network acted
as a central authority. However, as in other social organizations, there are certain
groups whose opinions matter.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-9"><P>Page 9</P></A>



<BLOCKQUOTE>
At the top of these groups is the Internet Society or ISOC
<a href="(http://info.isoc.org/index.html)">
(http://info.isoc.org/index.html)</A>, shown in figure 1.1. The Internet Society is a volunteer membership organization
that appoints the Internet Architecture Board, or the IAB <a href="(http://www.iab.org/iab/).">
(http://www.iab.org/iab/).</A> The
IAB is responsible for maintaining interoperable standards for communications as well
as Internet addressing.

The Internet Engineering Task Force or IETF <a href="(http://www.ietf.cnri.reston.va.us/)">
(http://www.ietf.cnri.reston.va.us/)</A> is
another volunteer organization that sets up working groups to deal with operational
and short-term technical problems. Anyone can participate in these working groups.
Their reports are recommendations for voluntary adoption or may be sent to the IAB for
more official treatment. As a participant and a user of the Internet, any network needs
to follow both IAB and IETF decisions and reports. Ignoring the recommendations
by these bodies often leaves no choice but to disconnect from the Internet.

Two-way Communications and the Web
</A></H4>

<P>The Internet can be thought of as a two-way broadcast system with the 
capacity to send targeted messages to individuals. It combines the 
characteristics of two-way communications, such as telephone and fax
</P>
<A NAME="PAGENUM-10"><P>Page 10</P></A>


<P>
(one-to-one communications), with those of broadcast media, such as
radio and television (one-to-many communications). It is not an exaggerated
prediction that the Internet, spurred on by the World Wide Web (WWW or
the web), will someday supersede all these communication mediums.
</P>

<P>The significance of the World Wide Web cannot be overemphasized in
the development of the Internet and electronic commerce. The web has
been touted as a multimedia presentation tool that is capable of enticing
more attention from viewers through interactive activities as opposed to earlier
text-based file transfer programs (see &quot;Predecessors of the Web,&quot; p.11). But the
even greater significance of the web lies in its capability for two-way,
many-to-many communication. Today's Internet marketers concentrate on developing
colorful and jazzy web pages to elicit visitors' attention. The premise of this
advertising, which is based on broadcast media, is to maximize the number of
&quot;eyeballs&quot; and their attention span using the most common denominators, such as
sex and violence. But Internet marketers have discovered that advertising
methods based on one-to-many broadcasting attracts responses, often negative, from
the viewers. And unlike over-the-air commercials or mass-mail advertising, users
of email can simply click a reply button to express their opinion, and their
messages travel back over the same medium to the source of those advertisements.
</P>

<P>A two-way broadcast system that gives the same level of reach, at a
low cost, to everyone connected to the network also means that large
corporations and companies do not necessarily dominate the marketing and distribution
in the market. If wordprocessors have made desktop publishing possible, the
web and its authoring language (HTML) have made everyone a potential
publisher. And with e-mail, these potential publishers have access to the same
marketing medium as large corporations.
</P>

<P>Increasingly, web browsers are becoming web publishers. As the number
of web surfers grows, more and more of these net-travelers are putting up
their own web pages to establish their points of presence. Subscribers to
America Online, Inc. <a href="(http://www.aol.com)">
(http://www.aol.com)</A>, can now make their own personal
web pages on the access provider's web server. Today, web servers usually reside
on expensive workstations because of their system requirements. But within a
few
</P>
<A NAME="PAGENUM-11"><P>Page 11</P></A>


<P>
years, web servers will be as simple as web browsers and as easily installed
and maintained on small computers. Personal web servers and the personal
web contents residing on these servers will establish a truly two-way
communication and will be a significant factor in growing Internet communication
and commerce.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The World Wide Web is only the most recent development designed to simplify the
user interface for file transfer by automating transfers and enriching content
presentation. Until very recently, the most frequently used method for transferring files was the
File Transfer Protocol (FTP), which requires a remote login and allows only authorized
users to connect. If you don't want to limit access, an anonymous FTP can be set up
that allows guest logins by virtually anyone on the Internet. Automated anonymous
FTP programs were the next step in presenting nontechnical connections to users, but
users still had to log out and log in whenever they wanted to connect to another site. The
next development following the automated FTP programs was
Gopher service, which ena-bled users to log into many sites in one session. Simple and consistent, a Gopher
client presents users with a series of menus in a hierarchy. FTP reached the pinnacle of
its popularity in 1993, and Gopher service was rapidly increasing in 1994.
<BR>

<BR>Conversely, the World Wide Web has reversed the growth of both. It has replaced FTP
as the easiest and most popular way to transfer files, and has replaced Gopher as the
preferred method for presenting files and information. Similar to Gopher, the web
allows users to browse different sites in one session, but instead of hierarchical menus it
uses jumps via hypertexted links to other web pages. Each web page is essentially a
different connection, which admittedly slows down data access. But unlike previous methods,
the web has an added feature of being able to transmit and display nontext files. This
capability to present digitized audio and video files compensates in many cases for the loss
in speed. Perhaps the most important feature, however, is the authoring program,
HTML, which is easy enough for nontechnical people to construct their own web pages.
This enables them to be content providers as well as content receivers. This combination
of advantages is fast eclipsing its Internet counterparts. While the web transmission
grew from almost zero to over 30 percent of the total data sent over the
National Science Foundation NET (NSFNET)&#151;the Internet's backbone until 1995&#151;the share of
FTP transactions has fallen by a third (see figure 1.2). Many files previously designated
for public access under anonymous FTP and Gopher servers are now being moved to
web servers and eventually the web may replace all other file transfer methods.
