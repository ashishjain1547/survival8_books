afforded small and medium size companies to take advantage of
electronic transactions.
</P>

<P>However, many interactions between sellers and buyers happen before
they are ready to exchange orders and bills. A somewhat broader view of
electronic commerce includes these interactions between businesses and
consumers. Consumer services and product announcements have been routinely
released to the Internet by computer companies for many years. And increasingly,
firms are gearing up for Internet advertising and marketing. Going even
further down the digital road, electronic shops and malls are springing up that
offer electronic versions of catalog shopping in which consumers can search
and order products using web browsers, bypassing traditional paper and
phone-based merchandising. Organizations devoted to commercial uses of
the Internet such as CommerceNet <a href="http://ww.commerce.net">
(http://ww.commerce.net)</A> and
government agencies such as the National Telecommunications and Information
Administration (NTIA) <a href="http://www.ntia.doc.gov">
(http://www.ntia.doc.gov)</A> have encouraged doing
business electronically by virtue of their presence on the Internet. As recently as
September, 1996, Yahoo!'s list of online malls contained over 700 shops
<a href="http://www.yahoo.">
(http://www.yahoo.</A>
com/text/Business_and_Economy/Companies/Shopping_Centers/Online_Malls) and Open Market's Commercial Sites
Index contained 41,731 listings of commercial web sites in October, 1996

Electronic Commerce of Digital Products
</A></H4>

<P>Despite the broadening view on electronic commerce, the commercial
Internet is still seen primarily as a new medium of communication, like an open
and interactive version of a magazine, television, or telephone. As an
efficient communications medium, the Internet can be used to facilitate
marketing, advertising, ordering, and customer service functions of the business
organizations, lessening their dependence on traditional media. With the
development of digital currency, many aspects of payment clearing procedures will
also change significantly, particularly in terms of per-transaction cost and
speed. Such changes in marketing, payment, and customer service will affect
the markets for both physical and digital products&#151;for example an online
</P>
<A NAME="PAGENUM-17"><P>Page 17</P></A>


<P>
furniture dealer as well as an electronic magazine distributor. However,
even more fundamental changes will accompany the online sale of digital
products since they, unlike physical products, can be both produced and delivered
over the network, transforming the very tenets of the manufacturing and
distribution functions.
</P>

<P>This business of digital products is radically advanced from
conventional electronic commerce areas, and requires further developments in
communications infrastructure, electronic payment systems, appropriate laws
regarding copyright and sales taxes, liability and consumer protection laws, and so on. 
It is no longer doing the same business electronically, but instead,
demands new business models and processes to take full advantage of the
enabling technologies in the multimedia industry. This core of electronic commerce,
as distinguished from conventional electronic commerce areas, is referred to as
a &quot;fully-digital business.&quot;
</P>

<P>Figure 1.3 shows the difference between the core of electronic
commerce and conventional electronic areas. A market is composed of three
components: players (or agents), products, and processes. Market players are sellers,
buyers, intermediaries, and other third parties, such as governments and
consumer advocacy groups. Products are the commodities being exchanged. The
interactions between market agents regarding products and other market activities
are processes, which include product selection, production, market
research, searches, ordering, payment, delivery, and consumption. These three
components of a market may be either physical (offline) or digital (online).
The horizontal axis in figure 1.3 represents whether market players are digital
or physical. For example, a web store is digital; a department store is
physical. Online shoppers are digital; shoppers in a mall are physical. Similarly,
the vertical axis represents the degree to which a product is digitized. For 
example, a printed newspaper is physical, whereas its online version is
digital. CD-ROMs are in-between because their contents are digital products
but packaged in physical containers. Finally, the third axis shows whether a
process is digital. Visiting a store is a physical process, whereas searching on the web
is a digital process.
</P>
<A NAME="PAGENUM-18"><P>Page 18</P></A>



<P>The traditional commerce&#151;the lower-left cube in the figure&#151;is where 
all three components are physical. In contrast, these components are all
digital at the core of electronic commerce, where not only production, but
also delivery, payment, and consumption (reading online or processing by a
computer program) occur online. The remaining white areas are part of
conventional electronic commerce, in which some of the components are digital.
For example, products may be physical, but marketing and payment may
be conducted online; products may be digital, but payments could be made
via checks, or buyers may be reading printouts instead of screen outputs.
The growing use of digital processes for business-to-business transactions
and consumer marketing is evident in the figure, which shows that
electronic commerce dominates the traditional market.

<P>Figure 1.3 Electronic commerce areas.
</P>

<P>Most of current electronic commerce applications and issues fall within
the white areas of figure 1.3, dealing with one aspect on a particular axis,
for example, setting up a web store, content digitization, electronic
payments, online marketing, and so on. Later chapters in this book also tackle these
issues one by one, and consumers are not limited to digital product sellers.
However, in each chapter, every effort to analyze an issue in a broader context
that includes all three components of a market is made. Therefore, product
</P>
<A NAME="PAGENUM-19"><P>Page 19</P></A>


<P>
digitization (of the product axis) is discussed in connection with online
consumption and digital marketing (of the process axis) and the role of web
store sales representatives (of the player axis).
</P>

<P>Market activities, from production to consumption, occurring
online, bypassing all paper-based transactions and traditional communications
media, represent the future of electronic commerce. The Internet becomes not only
an alternative communication medium, but a microcosm, or an electronic
version, of physical markets with characteristics that are fundamentally
different from physical markets. This digital world of business, in which market
institutions, agents, and products are becoming &quot;virtual&quot; and native to the Internet,
is also at the core of electronic commerce economics.
</P>

<P>The main difference between the digital world of business and the
traditional, physical business world stems from the very nature of digitized
products, which is discussed in Chapter 2. However, there are many reasons
why consumers too will behave differently in a networked market. For
example, access to product information via the network using sophisticated
computer programs will certainly affect the way consumers compare prices. In
turn, efficient shopping will affect product choices, pricing strategies, and
competitive efforts among sellers. Business organizations and relationships will also
be affected as spatial and temporal limitations of the market are removed
and replaced by different considerations of costs, efficiencies, and the mode
of interaction on a network. In other words, the market environment, enabled
by the open distributed Internet, resembles no other physical market. The
physical distance and geographical topology of a market are replaced with
network architectures and preference-based market territories. Thus, the objective is
to investigate the economic aspects of this newly emerging market of
electronic commerce by applying standard economic tools and by evaluating
qualitative differences in economic efficiencies and organizational changes.
</P>

<P>This analysis of the electronic commerce market is timelier than you
might think. The scope of digital products, and correspondingly, the scope of
electronic commerce, will be much wider than we imagine today, and
broaden much sooner. Although digitized information products are only a small 
portion of Internet-traded goods today, suitable online payment
systems,
