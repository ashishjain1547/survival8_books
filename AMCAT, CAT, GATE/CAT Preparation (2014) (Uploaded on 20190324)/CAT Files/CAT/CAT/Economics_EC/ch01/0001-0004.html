CHAPTER 1
</A></H3>

<H2>

Electronic Commerce and the <BR>
Internet

</H2>

<P>Our objective in this and the next two chapters is to provide you with a
framework for understanding the economic impact of the new business medium
by defining electronic commerce and the nature of digital products.
Opinions regarding the future of the Internet and electronic commerce may vary
widely, but the general consensus is that commercial uses of the Internet will have
an immense effect on businesses, governments, and consumers. The question
is, &quot;In exactly what areas and in what ways will they be affected?&quot; A shared
definition of electronic commerce is the first step toward presenting the answers.
</P>

<P>In this chapter, we discuss the characteristics of computing
environments that have made the Internet the infrastructure for electronic commerce.
Presented in section 1.1 is an overview of how computing and networking
environments have evolved into the Internet. The objective here is to
highlight differences between the Internet and previous computing and
communications environments in order to give a clearer understanding of the importance of
the Internet as a commercial medium.
</P>

<P>Section 1.2 reviews commercial and noncommercial uses of
computing and communication technologies, and defines what electronic commerce 
is within the context of changing technologies. It will be evident that
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-2"><P>Page 2</P></A>


<P>conventional distinctions between commercial and noncommercial uses of
the Internet are no longer valid. Section 1.3 discusses the market characteristics
of electronic commerce, pointing out the differences from traditional,
physical product markets as well as issues arising from the novice nature of
electronic commerce. Finally, in section 1.4,  key issues in electronic commerce
are discussed along with a look at how economic analysis may help to
resolve many uncertainties. While these snapshots put the issues in perspective,
later chapters will deal with each in depth.
</P>

1.1.Developments in Internetworking
</A></H3>

<P>The Internet is a network of networks. Each network is comprised of
com-puters connected by wire or wireless mediums, such as radio signals,
that enable component computers to &quot;talk&quot; to each other. Once computers
are networked, files on one computer can be accessed from any other computer
on the network; messages can be exchanged, and limited resources such as
printers can be shared. Large or small, each network is owned and managed by
a company or a single group with the exception of the Internet.
</P>

<P>The Internet is not owned or managed by any single entity, although
its component networks are independent units managed and usually paid for
by the network's owners. (Chapter 3, section 3.6, covers Internet technology
and infrastructure in detail; in this chapter, we focus on general characteristics
of the Internet as a market infrastructure.) Computers on these
component networks became a part of the larger Internet when they used the same
standard for cross-communication&#151;the TCP/IP protocol&#151;known as the
language of the Internet. Therefore, any computer &quot;speaking&quot; TCP/IP protocol
is Internet-enabled in terms of connectivity.
</P>

<P>The Internet is clearly the largest network of computers in existence
today. There are, however, many non-Internet networks such as commercial
online services that are quite large in their own right. The sudden dominance of
the
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-3"><P>Page 3</P></A>


<P>Internet as a model mechanism for information transfers and
commercial transactions may seem accidental in view of these large networks. However,
the Internet or Internet-like networks have two overriding factors in their favor
to become a market infrastructure: distributed computing and openness.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch01_ 3">
Distributed and Networked Computing
</A></H4>

<P>A distributed computing environment consists of multiple sites (or
computers) that are capable of performing the same type of functions or executing
a portion of a task. This is in contrast to a mainframe computer environment
in which shared users send commands and receive results via dumb
terminals connected to the computer. In a mainframe environment, all of the
computing necessary to process a task is done at the central computer (the
host), whereas terminals are used only for inputting instructions and displaying results.
The Internet, on the other hand, is an example of distributed computing in
which host and client computers are each capable of independent computing.
</P>

<P>The distinction between a host and a client is based on which machine
(or program) provides content and service. A client machine typically establishes
a connection to a host&#151;known also as a server&#151;and initiates a request for
a service, such as to download a file. A web browser, for example, is a
program that runs on a client machine, whereas an httpd, which sends out HTML
files (web pages) upon request by a browser, is a program that runs on a server.
</P>

<P>However, this distinction between a server and a client is only arbitrary.
In a distributed computer network, each connected computer can act as either
a server or a client. This potential is not obvious to many Internet initiates
who use their computers as clients only. But the strength of a distributed
computer network such as the Internet is its connectivity that supports
peer-to-peer relationships. What this means in terms of a market is that each computer
or user connected to a peer-to-peer network is a potential provider of
contents, for instance, a seller as well as a buyer. Any personal computer connected
to the Internet is capable of hosting a web site or sending a file instead of
simply acting as a tool to visit web sites and download files. The traditional
division between corporations as content providers and consumers as buyers is
still
</P>
<A NAME="PAGENUM-4"><P>Page 4</P></A>


<P>
evident in the way some commercial online services organize their services
so that subscribers are targeted only as readers or customers. Such customers
are assumed to be &quot;surfing&quot; the net just like television viewers and
newspaper readers are passively consuming the contents provided by the sellers.
</P>

<P>On the contrary, the strength of the Internet lies in the potentially
interactive environment in which consumers regard themselves also as the
content providers. The proliferation of personal homepages, which is often
dismissed as a transitory fad, indicates that the Internet users understand the power
of the medium in providing content. Nevertheless, the majority of Internet
users are assumed to remain passive. To surf the net, it may be adequate to have
a passive communication device which connects and downloads files without 
the capability to act as a host. A stripped-down network computer&#151;a
web-browsing machine with limited processing power&#151;resembles a
television receiver, or a dumb terminal of the bygone era.
</P>

<P>Even when consumers are not selling contents on the Internet,
the medium's interactivity enables sellers to collect information about
consumers' tastes and their preferences for product quality, price, and customer
service using the medium itself. Unlike the broadcasting media, the Internet
facilitates two-way interactions between sellers and buyers, the result of which can
also be fed seamlessly into production, marketing, transaction, and
consumption processes. In short, a network means a worldwide system of
interaction, whether for business or for communication, in which computers connected
to the network are simply points of presence.
</P>

<P>As the conventional distinction between a seller and a buyer is lost in
a distributed network such as the Internet, transactional processes undergo 
a similar transformation. A typical commercial transaction involves many 
agents and processes. Each of these processes performs a specific
function&#151;production, assembly, marketing, delivery, payment clearance,
insurance, certification, and so on, which typically occur in stages. Different
intermediaries have evolved to fulfill one or more of these functions in the physical
market. Intermediaries are now evolving to fulfill these functions in a
distributed computer network, where they may be processed simultaneously by
different
