      align=center><FONT face=Verdana color=#ffffff>ALL YOU WANTED TO 
      KNOW ABOUT MBA</FONT></P><FONT face=Verdana>Ask any MBA aspirant 
      why he wants to do MBA and the answers follow predictable lines. Everyone 
      wants to work in a multinational company and earn a fat salary, or is 
      preparing for it since friends are into it. Few actually know what to 
      expect from the profession. Almost everybody talks of a cousin or friend 
      who has made it big in some company or the other.<BR><BR>It is no wonder 
      that the average student and even people in other professions and jobs 
      have caught the MBA bug. When making money has become the central 
      objective of life, who wants to be stuck in a career that offers 
      less?<BR><BR>Lack of information and counselling results in young people 
      applying in hordes whether they have the aptitude or not, and the 
      mushrooming of sub-standard institutes catering to the demand, which 
      provide MBA degrees that can only be described as worthless. Very often, a 
      person finds that the MBA degree does not get the promised job in the 
      multinational and frustrations arise. Moreover, if every MBA were to be 
      taken by the multinationals, who would work for the Indian companies, some 
      of which are as good as, or even better, than any 
      multinational?<BR><BR><B><U>The Management Education 
      Scenario</U></B><BR>Management education in the country can roughly be 
      divided into four groups. At the top are the reputed institutes and some 
      university departments which have maintained the high quality of their 
      education. The second rung institutes are those started by industrial 
      houses, which offer some surety of a job after the course. The third rung 
      are university departments which have not been able to impart quality 
      education but can provide jobs in regional industrial groups. The fourth 
      rung are those institutes which have neither the advantage of low fees of 
      a university nor the backing of an industrial house. In recent times, a 
      number of academics, retired people, politicians and others have started 
      such institutes which remain essentially money making 
      devices.<BR><BR>Which institutes should one, apply for? Obviously, the 
      competition for the top institutes is great, since eveybody wants to do 
      the MBA from one. There is no surety of getting in. It is, therefore 
      better to spread risks and apply for institutes which are lower down also. 
      One should not apply to many of them, since each application costs about 
      Rs 1000 and applying to all would mean spending a small fortune. Depending 
      on one's ability and confidence, one should select one or two institutes 
      from each group and apply accordingly. Of course, the prospects and jobs 
      decrease as one goes down to the lower rung institutes.<BR><BR>Students 
      also have a problem in assessing an institute. There are several 
      yardsticks available and one should not go by the beautifully printed 
      prospectus that they have. Some important considerations are: whether the 
      institute has a permanent faculty and whether the faculty is 
      professionally qualified. Many institutes depend on contractual, part time 
      faculty members. The commitment of the part-time teacher is never total. 
      Others depend on researcher-type teachers who have no idea how real 
      businesses operate. What is required, instead, are people who have a 
      practical orientation and experience.<BR><BR>One should also check which 
      jobs the institute is able to get for its graduates. Usually, some 
      students geet good jobs using their own contacts, which the institute then 
      prints in its prospectus. It is important to see how industry rates the 
      institute.<BR><BR>Unfortunately, the student has no way of getting this 
      information. There is no rating agency and each institute makes tall 
      claims about its degree. The All India Council of Technical Education 
      (AICTE) has given its approval to many institutes without going into their 
      merits. This has caused great problems for students who have no yardstick 
      to go by except the AICTE approval, which does not mean a thing. The 
      situation is further complicated by the fact that some are worthless 
      institutes; recently some of them have been sent notices by the MRTP? Such 
      institutes not only have very high fee, but use the 'NRI Quota' to 
      circumvent the law on donations and only take in students who can pay 
      more. The degrees awarded by them are quite useless.<BR><BR><B><U>Training 
      for the corporate world.</U></B><BR>But these are not questions that 
      bother the MBA aspirant. Clearing the entrance test and joining the course 
      are the immediate hurdles and it is commonly believed that once a person 
      gets in he will most certainly become an MBA. Contrasted with courses for 
      Chartered Accountant or Company Secretary, where some people get caught in 
      the trap of rrepeating groups of papers, the MBA is a safe 
      option.<BR><BR>Not surprisingly, the sense of achievement in the MBA 
      student is very high. The course becomes one huge ego trip. Many students 
      do not spend as much time on their training as they should, thinking that 
      the MBA stamp will take them through jobs. This is only partially true. No 
      company takes a person for his label alone, but for what he can 
      contribute. The MBA is chosen for his professionalism and his training, 
      his skills and his ability to manage. The two years of training are 
      therefore best spent in acquiring these skills.<BR><BR>How are these 
      skills acquired? First, it requires gathering knowledge and insight. Many 
      students are used to their undergraduate classes where notes are made and 
      some questions are mugged up near the exams, which is enough to see them 
      through. The management course is unlike any of those courses. Application 
      of knowledge and not mere bookish knowledge is required. That is why the 
      good institutes by emphasis on case discussions and group 
      assignments.<BR><BR>The student must learn everything that may be required 
      in business situations. A good personality should be developed. 
      Unfortunately, many lower-rung institutes and university departments do 
      not have facilities for personality development or teachers trained in 
      group methods. The result is a stunted MBA which no good company would 
      liketo touch. It is thus important to do the course from a reputed 
      institute.<BR><BR>The bad institutes do not insist on hard work simply 
      because they are not committed. There is emphasis on partying and having a 
      good time. Many institutes in Delhi and elsewhere are known for such 
      activities. To hide their shortcomings, they have collaborations with 
      fancy sounding foreign universities and introduce exotic courses like 
      yoga, spiritualism and "Eastern Management". One institute advertises a 
      golf course and swimming pool on its campus. The corporate sector is 
      usually not impressed by such gimmicks.<BR><BR>Many students come to grief 
      when they find that their expensive diplomas are not good enough to get 
      them jobs. In many institutes, the toppers get the good jobs but the 
      average students have to accept lower offers. Youngsters who believe that 
      merely the MBA label is a ticket to the good life face serious adjustment 
      problems and frequent change of jobs. The MBA, in fact, should be treated 
      only as a time to prepare for the corporate world.<BR><BR><B><U>Qualities 
      to be acquired</U></B><BR>A good institute, on the other hand, puts 
      pressure on the students to be on their toes and updated in their subjects 
      at all times. Graduates report that in certain semesters they get very 
      little sleep, so hard is the pressure to perform. Tests are announced at 
      the last moment when the students are preparing to sleep, so that a person 
      must be updated in all subjects at all times. Case studies enhance the 
      applicability of concepts and theory to real life situations. This results 
      in a person acquiring professional competence. Ultimately, the MBA must be 
      seen as preparation for entry into the corporate sector.<BR><BR>A 
      competitive spirit must also be developed. A corporate career is not one 
      for comfortable jobs and the sooner a person acquires the competitive 
      spirit, the better off he will be.<BR><BR>Since any job in a company will 
      require a person to make presentations and to convince others, a person 
      must learn presentation skills and be a natural leader. Ability to take 
      good decisions under pressure is also required. Many skills, such as 
      quantitative analysis, are learnt from books but analysis of business 
      situations is also required. This is done through case studies.<BR><BR>The 
      summer training is another method of using the knowledge in real life 
      situations. The training should be used as an opportunity to prove oneself 
      and some meaningful work should be done. Professional competence is 
      rewarded when the summer training results in an offer of a permanent job 
      on completion of the degree. In this way, many students find jobs during 
      their summer training, much before the actual completion of their 
      course.<BR><BR>A student must keep a level head even though everybody he 
      meets says that clearing the entrance test was a big achievement. The real 
      achievement is to come after two years when jobs are required. The years 
      in the institute should be utilised to learn the skills in the best 
      possible way. If the student is not busy enough, the MBA degree will be 
      worthless even though it may have a fancy name.<BR><B><U><BR>Managing 
      Expectations</U></B><BR>One of the myths that students have is that they 
      will become senior managers the moment they complete the MBA. Certain 
      companies have found that expectations and ambitions of MBAs are difficult 
      to meet and they have taken policy decisions not to hire fresh MBAs. 
      Though the MBA is a coveted degree, it becomes important to keep a level 
      head and keep one's expectations low. According to the hype, an MBA is a 
      senior manager, but fresh MBAs are usually taken at the level of 
      management trainees. Initially, some low and tedious work may have to be 
      done.<BR><BR>If a student is not reconciled to this, frustrations are 
      bound to arise. Job hopping is common, which ultimately hurts the career 
      of the youngster. Further, the company too has its expectations from the 
      management graduate to whom it is paying a high salary. The second part of 
      the article will describe what is expected of the MBA in a company. 
      Somewhere, the expectations have to be reconciled for the high growth 
      career of management to be a success.<BR><BR><B><U>Opportunities in 
      Management</U></B><BR>Rapid expansion of Industries in India has opened 
      new vistas for excellent opportunities of careers in management. New 
      Economic Policy of liberalization and decontrols has increased the demand 
      for managerial personnel in the corporate sector. Advent of multinational 
      companies, which has just begun, may further increase the quest of the 
      industrial sector in all fields of management like Finance, Production, 
      Marketing, Personnel and Administration.<BR>The careers in management 
      offer one of the best remuneration package in the country, particularly in 
      the private sector. Recent decision of the Government to raise the upper 
      limit of monthly salary to the managers to Rs 50,000 has made careers in 
      management even more attractive. In addition to best of the salaries 
      offered by this career, it also offers outstanding developmental 
      opportunities to enable the competent and dynamic managers to rise to the 
      level of Chief-executive. Several Indian professionals today are working 
      as Managing Directors in many multi-nationals. Management professionals 
      from India are also in good demand in international market. Private sector 
      today offers rapid advancement to result-oriented professionals. Excellent 
      perks are offered which may include free accommodation free 
      conveyance/attractive conveyance allowance, CPF, leave travel concession, 
      medical allowance/reimbursement etc.<BR><BR>Those who prefer Public Sector 
      Undertakings (PSU), may join these undertakings at several levels. The 
      managerial hierarchy and pay-structure in most of the PSU's is 
      pre-determined and also includes some perks, though not as attractive as 
      offered by the private sector.<BR><BR><B><U>Areas in Management 
      Services</U></B><BR>Marketing, Finance, Production and Personnel are the 
      four major areas in management with each having several sub-branches. 
      Marketing Management includes sales, purchase, international marketing 
      (exports-imports), advertising, marketing strategy, materials management, 
      consumers' behaviour, market development and research. Financial 
      Management includes all the aspects relating to finances, investments, 
      financing decisions, portfolio management, project management, working 
      capital management, international financial management, etc. Production 
      Management takes care of Production methodology, costing, operations 
      research and quality control etc. Personnel Management deals with the most 
      complicated aspect i.e. management. It looks after the areas of Human 
      Resource Development (HRD), recruitment, training, management-union 
      relations, labour and personnel policies, organisation behaviour, 
      management of change and general administration.<BR><BR>A degree of Master 
      in Business Administration (MBA) is considered to be the gateway to 
      careers in management. While choosing the area of specialisation in 
      management, the candidates must gauge their aptitude for a particular 
      aspect of management. Candidates with commerce background usually go in 
      for Financial Management and the technical graduates with science or 
      engineering degrees usually choose Production Management. Rest of the 
      candidates choose Marketing Management or Personnel Management, depending 
      upon their aptitudes and flairs.<BR><BR><B><U>MBA Degree</U></B><BR>Master 
      of Business Administration is normally considered to be the basic and 
      ideal post-graduate qualification for taking up a good and rewarding 
      career in management. As per one estimate, every year about 10,000 MBAs 
      are churned out by Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs) and a host of 
      other universities and recognised institutes/deemed universities. A 
      candidate with a good MBA degree finds no problem in getting a good job 
      and freshers are usually inducted as Management Trainees for one to two 
      years, before getting absorbed in regular scales. After a few years of 
      experience, MBAs may choose the job of their own liking at very attractive 
      terms.<BR><BR>Several institutes/universities also offer post-graduate 
      diplomas of one to two-year duration on Business Management, Marketing 
      Management, HRD, Personnel Management and Labour Welfare, Basic Finance, 
      Financial Management, Materials Management, Operations Management, etc. 
      But as a matter of rule, MBA degree is considered to be ideal by the 
      job-seekers as well as the employers. Diplomas also assist in finding good 
      openings, provided these are supplemented with some relevant 
      experience.<BR><BR>(a) <B>Admission</B>: One of the toughest steps in this 
      direction is to get admission for MBA degree. All graduates with minimum 
      50 per cent marks are eligible for admission. The admission is through an 
      entrance test, which offers very tough competition. Some universities keep 
      some seats reserved for "internal" students who graduate from the same 
      university, apart from the prescribed reservations for scheduled 
      caste/scheduled tribe candidates.<BR>The most prestigious degree of MBA is 
      the one awarded by four Institutes of Management (IIMs) located at 
      Ahmedabad, Calcutta, Bangalore and Lucknow. In addition, some universities 
      of repute also carry out MBA programme. Some of these are Delhi 
      University, Bombay University, Madras University, Calcutta University, 
      Punjab University, Aligarh Muslim University, Banaras Hindu University, 
      Allahabad University, Baroda University, Mysore University, Cochin 
      University, Patna University, Ranchi University, Magadh University, 
      Jodhpur University, Jammu University, Bhopal University etc. In addition 
      to the above, there are several other universities and institutes like 
      Indian Institute of Foreign Trade, Tata Institue of Social Sciences, 
      Indian Institute of Rural Management and Institute of Management which 
      also conduct MBA programmes.<BR><BR>(b) <B>CAT By IIMs</B>: For admission 
      to MBA programme, IIMs hold a Common Admission Test (CAT) every year, 
      generally in the month of December. The test is conducted on all-India 
      basis at several centres, covering almost the entire country. A 
      notification regarding CAT usually appears in the month of September in 
      several national newspapers as well as in the "Employment News". The dates 
      of commencement of academic session are different for all the four 
      Institutes. CAT is of 2-hour duration. It is objective type (multiple 
      choice) and includes questions on English language, analytical ability, 
      reading comprehension, data interpretation and reasoning ability. This 
      year CAT is to be held on December 12.<BR><BR>In addition to the written 
      test, the candidates may also be tested in the following:<BR>(i) group 
      discussion; (ii) leadership tests; (iii) case study; and (iv) personal 
      interview.<BR><BR>The thrust of the CAT is to choose the candidates with 
      high intelligence quotient, leadership qualities, clear understanding and 
      good expression. The number of seats vary from 100 to 180 and the IIMs 
      have reservation for SC/ST candidates @ 15 per cent and 7.5 per cent 
      respectively.<BR><BR>(c) Entrance test by Universities: The selection of 
      candidates for MBA programme is made through entrance test by the 
      universities, depending upon the number of seats and quantum of 
      competition. The entrance test is for two to three hour duration. Some of 
      the universities have more than one papers. The paper usually is objective 
      type (multiple choice) in nature and covers areas like reasoning, reading 
      comprehension, quantitative aptitude, data interpretation, general 
      awareness, business communication skills etc. The exact layout of the 
      question paper varies in different 
      universities.<BR><BR><B><U>Part-time/Correspondence 
      Course</U></B><BR>Several universities like University of Delhi, Madras, 
      Calcutta, Bombay, Gujarat, Osmania and Punjab hold part-time course for 
      MBA. Part-time programmes are designed to last for 5 to 7 semesters and 
      the classes are held in the evening. Apart from requirement of a good 
      bachelor's degree, part-time programmes also require some experience at 
      supervisory level. While part-time courses are available only to the 
      candidates belonging to a particular city/town where such university is 
      located, MBA courses offered through correspondence/self-instructional 
      method are designed to assist the candidates located at far flung areas. 
      Some universities like Punjabi University, Patiala and Indira Gandhi 
      National Open University (IGNOU) offer such courses. IGNOU is one of the 
      premier institutions which offers MBA programme through a nation-wide 
      network of its 170 study centres. Internationally recognized as a centre 
      of excellence for studies, IGNOU offers a 5-semester MBA programme and 
      also proovides the facility of counselling. This course is particularly 
      useful for the officers of Armed Forces who retire at relatively younger 
      age, and also to those Government servants who wish to seek careers in 
      managerial cadres by seeking premature retirement.<BR><BR>An advantage to 
      do MBA from IGNOU is that the Candidates who, for any reasons, cannot 
      complete the entire programme and are able to pass only a few 
      subjects/papers, are awarded diplomas like Diploma in Management, Post 
      Graduate (PG) Deiploma in Business Management, PG Diploma in Marketing 
      Management , PG Diploma in HRD, PG Diploma in Financial Management, etc, 
      depending on the number of papers passed by the candidates. Another 
      advantage is that the number of seats for MBA programme is determined 
      study-centre-wise which offers a large number of seats at all India 
      level.<BR><BR>The candidates seeking admission in this programme offered 
      by IGNOU must have completed 25 years of age and must have at least three 
      years' experience in the supervisory capacity. There is, however, no upper 
      age limit. The admission is made entirely on the basis of marks obtained 
      in the entrance test which is for two-hour duration and has about 100 
      objective type questions on comprehension, reasoning, English language, 
      general awareness, data interpretation, quantitative aptitude 
    etc.</FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
