        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">To be effective
        is the job of the executive. Whether he works in a business or in a
        hospital, in a government agency or in a labour union, in a university
        or in the army, the executive is expected to get the right things done.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>He is expected to be effective.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">&nbsp;</font><font size="3">The
        realities of an executive’s situation both demand effectiveness from
        him and make effectiveness exceedingly difficult too achieve. Indeed,
        unless executives work at becoming effective, the realities of their
        situation will make their efforts futile.</font></font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;There are
        four hurdles which stand in the way of an executive’s effectiveness.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;a) The
        executive’s time tends to belong to others who can encroach on his
        time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">&nbsp;</font><font size="3">b)
        Executives are forced to keep on ‘operating’ unless they take
        positive action to change the reality in &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which
        they live and work.</font></font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;c) The
        executive is within an organization.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>He is effective only if and when other people make use of
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what he contributes.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;d) The
        executive sees the outside only through thick and distorting lenses, if
        at all.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>What goes on &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; outside is usually not even known
        firsthand. This is unfortunate because there are no results
        within&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the organization.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>All the results are outside.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>What happens inside any organization is effort and &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cost.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>

        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Effectiveness,
        is a habit, that must be developed by practice.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">&nbsp;</font><font size="3">Five
        habits of the mind are needed to be an effective executive:</font></font></p>

        </span>They work systematically at managing the&nbsp; <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; little of their time that can be brought

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>They are more concerned with the results rather than with the
        work to be done.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;c)<span style="mso-tab-count:
1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Effective executives build on strengths – their own
        strengths, the strengths of their superiors, <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; colleagues, and sub-ordinates; and
        the strengths of the situation, that is, on what they can do.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>They do not build on weakness.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>

        superior performance will produce&nbsp; <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; outstanding results.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>They are good at setting priorities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>They know that they have no choice but to <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; do first things first – and
        second things not at all.<span style="mso-spacerun:

        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;e)<span style="mso-tab-count:
1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Effective executives, finally, make effective decisions.
        They know that an effective decision is <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; always a judgment based on
        dissenting opinions rather than by consensus. And they know that to <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; make many decisions fast means to
        make the wrong decisions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They
        make a few, but fundamental <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; decisions in a systematic way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>

        </o:p>
        </span></font></font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Effective
        executives do not start with their tasks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>They start with their time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>They find out where their time actually goes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Then they attempt to manage their time and to cut back
        unproductive demands on their time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Finally they consolidate their “discretionary” time into the
        largest possible units.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Most of the
        tasks of the executive require, for minimum effectiveness, a fairly
        large quantum of time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To
        spend in one stretch less than this minimum is sheer waste.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>This is particularly true with respect to time spent working with
        people. To spend a few minutes with people is simply not productive.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">There<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>are some effective executives who make decisions fast, and
        others who make them rather slowly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>But without exception, they make personnel decisions slowly and
        they make them several times before they really commit themselves.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The essence of
        systematic time management is finding the unproductive, time-wasting
        activities and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
        getting rid of them. First one must identify and eliminate the things
        that need not be done at all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To
        find these time-wasters, one must ask of all activities: “What would
        happen if this were not done at all?” And if the answer is, “Nothing
        would happen,” then obviously the conclusion is to stop doing it. The
        next question is: “Which of the activities could be done by somebody
        else just as well, if not better?”</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">A common cause
        of time-waste is largely under the executive’s control and can be
        eliminated by him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That is
        the time of others he himself wastes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>So, effective executives must learn to ask systematically and
        without hesitation: “What do I do that wastes your time without
        contributing to your effectiveness?”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Some
        time-wasters are the result of lack of system or foresight.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Here, one must look for the recurrent “crisis,” the crisis
        that comes back year after year.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A
        crisis that recurs a second time is a crisis that must not occur again.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Time-wasters
        may also result from overstaffing.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Another common
        time-waster is malorganization. Its symptom is too many meetings.
        Meetings are necessary because people holding different jobs have to
        cooperate to get a specific task done.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>They may be needed because the knowledge and experience needed in
        a specific situation are not available in one head, but have to be
        pieced together out of the experience and knowledge of several people.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">But meetings
        have to be the exception rather than the rule.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>An organization in which too much time is spent on meetings is an
        organization in which little gets done.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">As a rule,
        meetings should never be allowed to become the main demand on an
        executive’s time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Too
        many meetings imply poor structure of jobs and the wrong organizational
        components.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They indicate
        that work that should be in one job or in one component is spread over
        several jobs or several components.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>They signify that responsibility is diffused and that
        information is not addressed to the people who need it.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">Focus
        on contribution</font></b></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The effective
        executive focuses on contribution.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>He asks: “What can I contribute that will significantly affect
        the performance and the results of the institution I serve?” The focus
        on contribution turns the executive’s attention away from his own
        department and specialization toward the performance of the whole.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>It also turns his attention to the outside, where the results
        lie.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">It is the man
        who focuses on contribution and who takes responsibility for results, no
        matter how junior, who is in the most literal sense of the phrase,
        “top management.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
        holds himself accountable for the performance of the whole organization.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Every
        organization needs performance in three major areas: It needs direct
        results; building of values and their reaffirmation; and building and
        developing people for tomorrow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All
        three areas have to be built into the contribution of every executive.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The relative
        importance among the three dimensions of performance will change as a
        manager moves up the corporate ladder. The most common cause of
        executive failure is inability or unwillingness to change with the
        demands of a new position.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
        newly promoted executive who keeps on doing what he has done
        successfully in the past is almost bound to fail.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The executive who fails to understand this will suddenly do the
        wrong things the wrong way.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Executives can
        develop good human relations by focusing on contribution in their own
        work and in their relationships with others. Warm feelings and pleasant
        words are meaningless, in the absence of a work-focused and task-focused
        relationship.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>On the other
        hand, an occasional rough word will not disturb a relationship that
        produces results and accomplishments for all concerned.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">Leveraging
        on strengths</font></b></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The task of an
        executive is not to change human beings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>His task is to multiply the performance capacity of the whole by
        leveraging on the strengths of individual employees.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The effective
        executive fills positions and promotes on the basis of what a man can
        do.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He does not make
        staffing decisions to eliminate weaknesses but to maximize strength. The
        effective executive knows that to get strength one has to put up with
        weaknesses. Effective executives know that they have to start with what
        a man can do rather than with what a job requires.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>They do their thinking about people long before the decision on
        filling a job has to be made, and independently of it.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The executive
        who is concerned with what a man cannot do and who therefore tries to
        avoid weakness rather than make strength effective is a weak man
        himself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He probably sees
        strength in others as a threat to himself.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Effective
        executives know that their subordinates are paid to perform and not to
        please their superiors. So they never ask “How does he get along with
        me?”<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>They ask “What does he (the subordinate) contribute?”
        “What can he do uncommonly well?”</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Men who build
        great executive teams are not usually close to their immediate
        colleagues and subordinates.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They
        pick people for what they can do rather than on the basis of their
        personal likes and dislikes. They seek performance, not conformance. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>To
        ensure this outcome, they maintain a distance from their close
        colleagues.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Effective
        executives know that jobs are designed by highly fallible men.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>They are therefore forever on guard against the “impossible”
        job, the job that simply is not for normal human beings. Any job that
        has defeated two or three men in succession, even though each had
        performed well in his previous assignments must be redesigned.</font></p>

        priorities</font></b></font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">If there is any
        one “secret” of effectiveness, it is concentration.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Effective executives concentrate on one thing at a time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>They do the first things first.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Concentration
        is necessary because the executive has so many tasks to be done.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>For doing one thing at a time means doing it fast.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The more one can concentrate time, and resources, the greater the
        number and diversity of tasks one can actually perform.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The first rule
        for the concentration of executive efforts is to get rid of unnecessary
        activities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Effective
        executives periodically review their activities and ask: “If we did
        not already do this would we go into it now?” And if the answer is not
        an unconditional yes they drop the activity or curtail it sharply.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The difficulty
        does not often lie with the total failures.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>They liquidate themselves.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But
        what has succeeded in the past, always lingers on long beyond its
        productive life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Putting
        all programs and activities regularly on trial for their lives and
        getting rid of the unwanted ones is the best way to stimulate creativity
        even in the most hidebound bureaucracy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;<o:p>

        always more productive tasks for tomorrow that one can handle given the
        limited time and human resources.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A

        which are of less importance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Tasks
        always adjust to the available time. Opportunities will become available
        only to the extent to which capable people are around to take charge of

        </span>Thinking through what is “right,” that is, the solution which

        </span>The “feedback” which tests the validity and effectiveness of
        the decision against the actual course of events.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">All but the
        truly unique events require a generic solution.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>They require a rule, a policy, a principle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Once the right principle has been developed, all manifestations
        of the same generic situation can be handled pragmatically.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Truly unique events, however, must be treated individually.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>One cannot develop rules for the exceptional.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The two basic
        mistakes are to treat a generic situation as if it were a series of
        unique events and to treat a new event as if it were just another
        example of the old problem to which, the old rules can be applied.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The effective
        decision-maker always tries to put his solution at the highest possible
        conceptual level. He assumes initially that the problem is generic. He
        always assumes that the event that clamors for his attention is in
        reality a symptom.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
        examines what lies below.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
        is not content with doctoring the symptom alone. And if the event is
        truly unique, the experienced decision-maker suspects that this heralds
        a new underlying problem and that what appears as unique will turn out
        to have been simply the first manifestation of a new generic situation.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The effective
        executive does not make many decisions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Not because he is slow but because he does not need to make many
        decisions. He deals with generic situations through a rule or policy. So
        he can handle most events as cases under the rule; that is, by
        adaptation.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The most
        time-consuming step in decision making is not making the decision but
        implementing it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>While an
        effective decision must be based on the highest level of conceptual
        understanding, the action to carry it out should be as close as possible
        to the working level and as simple as possible.&nbsp;<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Implementing a
        decision requires answering several distinct questions: Who has to know
        of this decision? What action has to be taken? Who is to take it? And
        what does the action have to be so that the people who have to do it can
        do it?</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">To go and look
        for oneself is also the best way to test whether the assumptions on
        which a decision had been made are still valid. One always has to expect
        the assumptions to become obsolete sooner or later.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Reality never stands still for long.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Failure to go out and look is the typical reason for persisting
        with a course of action long after it has ceased to be appropriate or
        even rational.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">A decision is a
        judgment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is a choice
        between alternatives.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is
        rarely a choice between right and wrong.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>It is more often a choice between almost right and probably
        wrong.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Decisions
        should follow from conflicting views, the dialogue between different
        points of view, the choice between different judgments.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The first rule in decision-making is that one does not make a
        decision unless there is disagreement.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Disagreement
        acts as a safeguard against the decision-maker’s becoming the prisoner
        of the organization.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Everybody
        is a special pleader, trying to obtain the decision in his favor.
        Disagreement provides alternatives to a decision.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>And without alternatives a decision is a desperate gambler’s
        throw, no matter how carefully thought through it might be.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The effective
        decision-maker does not impose his views on others. He does not start
        out with the assumption that one proposed course of action is right and
        that all others must be wrong.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
        starts out with the commitment to find out why people disagree.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Effective
        executives do not see anything wrong with the man who disagrees with
        them.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>They know that unless proven otherwise, the dissenter may
        have reached a different conclusion because he sees a different reality
        and is concerned with a different problem.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The effective executive is concerned first with understanding.
        Only then does he even think about who is right and who is wrong.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">There is one
        final question which effective decision-maker askers ask: “Is a
        decision really necessary?” One alternative is to do nothing.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">One has to make
        a decision when a condition is likely to degenerate if nothing is done.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>This also applies with respect to opportunity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>If the opportunity is important and is likely to vanish unless
        one acts with dispatch, one has to act.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">At the opposite
        end there are those conditions which may take care of themselves even if
        nothing is done.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If the
        answer to the question “What will happen if we do nothing?” is “It
        will take care of itself,” one does not interfere.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>One also does not act if the condition, while annoying, is of no
        importance and unlikely to make any difference anyhow.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The great
        majority of decisions will lie between these extremes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The problem may not take care of itself. But it may also not turn
        into a degenerative malignancy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
        opportunity is only for improvement rather than for real change and
        innovation; but it is still quite considerable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>If we do not act, in other words, we will in all probability
        survive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But if we do act,
        we may be better off. In this situation the effective decision-maker
        acts if on balance the benefits greatly outweigh cost and risk. But
        under no circumstances does he “hedge” or compromise. Half-action is
        the one thing that is always wrong.</font></p>

        Notes</font></b></p>

        </span>The executive who works at making his and others’ strengths
        productive works at making organizational performance compatible with
        personal achievement. He works at making his knowledge area become an
        organizational opportunity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And

        effectiveness can enable this society to harmonize its two needs: the

        as his tool for the accomplishment of his purpose.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
