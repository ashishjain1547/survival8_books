        Introduction</font></b></p>
        <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In
        turbulent times, an enterprise has to be managed both to withstand
        sudden blows and to exploit unexpected opportunities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>In short, the fundamentals have to be managed well. In
        predictable times, the fundamentals tend to be taken for granted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>But the fundamentals deteriorate unless they are managed
        carefully, consistently and conscientiously.&nbsp;<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In
        turbulent times, the financials have to be carefully monitored and
        managed. Liquidity is more important than earnings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>A business can survive long periods of low earnings or low
        revenues if it has adequate cash flow and financial strength.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The opposite is not true.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Stock
        markets price companies by their financial position rather than by their
        earnings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And liquidity,
        unlike reported earnings, is a reasonably reliable measure even in
        inflationary times.&nbsp;<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In
        turbulent times, the balance sheet becomes more important than the
        profit and loss statement. The management has to put financial strength
        before earnings, and it is essential to know the minimum liquidity
        needed to stay in business.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman" color="#3333FF" size="4">The
        importance of productivity</font></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Making
        resources productive is the specific job of management.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>It is only managers not nature or laws of economics or
        governments that make resources productive. Before Taylor, the only way
        to get more output was to work harder and longer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>But Taylor realised that the way to get more output was to work
        more productively.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He saw
        that the productivity of work was not the responsibility of the worker
        but of the manager. Taylor applied knowledge to human labor and, in
        accordance with the nineteenth-century realities, to manual labor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>It is now clear that to improve productivity,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>knowledge has to be applied to all resources: capital, key
        physical resources, time, and knowledge itself. What makes one company
        stand out and lead in any one industry, is that it operates at about
        twice the average productivity of its industry, its economy, or its
        area.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Four
        key resources have to be managed consistently, systematically, and
        conscientiously for improving productivity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>They are capital, crucial physical assets, time, and knowledge.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Each of these resources has to be managed separately and
        differently.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Executives
        are, of course, aware that they have to manage productivity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>But most of them believe this means finding the “trade-off”
        between a less productive and a more productive resource.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>There is little evidence that this “trade-off” has ever
        really worked as a way to increase overall productivity. Managers will
        have to assume that any decrease in the productivity of any one resource
        is likely to mean a decrease in overall productivity that cannot easily
        be offset.</font></p>

        </font></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Managing
        the fundamentals includes earning today the costs of staying in business
        tomorrow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A business that
        does not earn these costs is bound to fade away.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>These are not “future costs”; they are costs incurred now
        though not paid out until later.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They
        are “accrued” or “deferred” costs.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">“Profit”
        is an accounting illusion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Except
        in the rare case of the governmental monopoly, there are no profits.
        There are only the deferred costs of staying in business. The minimum
        cost of staying in business is the cost of capital. Economic advance
        depends on the ability of an economy to form capital, that is, to
        generate a surplus of current production over the costs of the past and
        present.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">But
        economic advance also means the ability to substitute knowledge and
        skill for muscle and sweat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It
        means the creation of more and better jobs. This too depends, on the
        rate of capital formation and on the ability to invest larger and larger
        sums in the creation of future jobs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The more knowledge a job puts to work, the more capital
        investment does it require.&nbsp;<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In
        turbulent times, the need for capital formation is bound to go up, if
        only because turbulent times mean greater uncertainty and a higher risk
        premium on the committal of present and certain resources to the future.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The times ahead will be times of great change and innovation,
        socially and technologically. This again means higher risks in the
        future.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Finally, in all
        developed countries, there is under way a sharp shift to skilled jobs
        requiring higher capital investment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>In the developing countries the need ahead is for jobs –
        manufacturing jobs, mainly – that will require substantial capital
        investments, even if the investment in the individual job is not much.&nbsp;<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Future
        revenues are always hard to estimate. In turbulent times even two or
        three years in the future is a fairly long period.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>But the costs of staying in business can be estimated with high
        probability quite a few years out precisely because they are not future
        but deferred costs. The cost of capital is as mentioned earlier, the
        minimum cost of staying in business.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;<o:p>

        resources</font></h2>
        <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Managers
        have to manage both today and tomorrow. It is wrong to assume that
        tomorrow will be an extension of today. Managers<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>must be prepared for change.&nbsp;<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In

        to control the assignment of its resources.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>It needs to think through where the results are likely to be.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>It needs to know the performing and productive resources within
        itself, and especially the performing and productive people.&nbsp;<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">One
        way to exercise assignment control and to concentrate is to have two
        budgets: an operational budget for the things that are already being
        done, and an opportunities budget for proposed new and different
        ventures.</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The
        questions management asks of these two budgets are quite different. For
        the operational budget, the management must examine whether it is the
        right opportunity.</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;<o:p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A
        ship that spends long periods of time at sea needs to be cleansed of its
        barnacles or their drag will deprive it of speed and maneuverability.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Similarly an enterprise that has sailed in calm waters for a long
        time must introspect and cleanse itself of the products, services,
        ventures that only absorb resources; the products, services, ventures
        that have become obsolete.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Far
        too few businesses are willing to discard their accumulated baggage. As
        a result, many of them do not have resources available for tomorrow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>In turbulent times, a business needs to be able both to outride
        sudden hard blows and to avail itself of sudden unexpected
        opportunities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For both,
        the concentration of resources on results and discarding unproductive
        activities are primary requirements.&nbsp;<o:p>

        right kind of growth</font></h3>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A
        business needs to distinguish between the wrong kind of growth and the
        right kind of growth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Any
        growth which, within a short period of time, results in an overall
        increase in the total productivity of the enterprise’s resources is
        healthy growth. It should be supported.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>But growth that results only in volume and does not, within a
        fairly short period of time, produce higher productivity is fat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Any increase in volume that does not lead to higher overall
        productivity should be sweated off.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Finally, any increase in volume that leads to reduced
        productivity, except for the shortest of start-up periods, is
        degenerative if not pre-cancerous.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>It should be eliminated fast.&nbsp;<o:p>

        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In
        the past, new industries have rarely grown from existing old ones.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The new industries of the last thirty years have primarily been
        developed by companies that either did not exist at all before World War
        II or were unknown and inconspicuous then.&nbsp;<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">It
        is reasonable to suggest that many of the giants of tomorrow will be
        companies that either do not exist today or are so small as to be almost
        invisible.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Yet,
        paradoxically, the innovations of tomorrow will have to come out of
        existing large companies far more than in earlier periods.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>One reason is the escalation of marketing costs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The amount of money needed to make a fundamental invention is
        probably the same.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>But the amount of money, time, and effort needed to convert
        an invention into a product or service, let alone a new industry, is
        many times greater than it used to be.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>There is also a greater need for people with specialized skills.
        Such people are found largely in existing large companies.&nbsp;<o:p>

        does not necessarily mean research, which is only one tool of
        innovation.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>It means, the systematic search for opportunities – in the
        vulnerabilities of a technology, a process, a market: in the lead time
        of new knowledge; in the needs and wants of the market.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>It means the willingness to organize for entrepreneurship, to
        aim at creating new businesses rather than new products or modifications
        of old products.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It means,
        finally, the willingness to set up the innovative venture separately,
        outside the existing managerial structure, to organize proper accounting
        concepts and to design suitable rewards and incentives for innovators.&nbsp;<o:p>

        many markets one prospers only at the extremes. Either one can be a
        market leader who sets the standard. Or one can be a specialist

        strengths in knowledge, service, and adaptation to specific needs as to
        be ahead of others and carve out a niche for itself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

        profitable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This is only
        partly in accord with the evidence. What is profitable is either market
        leadership in a broad market or focus on a niche segment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>And what “market leadership” means is a matter of industry
        and market structure rather than of sales volume, something that varies

        predictable than other trends. The most important change is not the much
        discussed “population explosion” in the developing countries, but
        the imminent labor shortage in the developed countries especially the
        shortage of young people available for traditional jobs in manufacturing
        and services.</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;<o:p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In
        all developed countries, except Great Britain, the postwar years brought
        an unprecedented educational shift that has changed drastically the age
        of entrance into the labour force and the expectations of the young
        people entering the job market.</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;<o:p>

        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The
        most extreme case is Japan. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Before
        World War II, the Japanese life expectancy at birth was forty-eight
        years for men and fifty-two for women. These figures did not change
        until 1950.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Now, Japan has
        one of the highest life expectancies in the world, well into the
        seventies for both sexes.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Traditional
        pension systems were designed to take care of surviving widows and minor
        children rather than to provide the superannuated employee with a
        retirement pension.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Such
        inappropriate systems<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>will
        put pressure on governments.&nbsp;<o:p>

        <h3 align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4" color="#3333FF">Global
        value chain configuration</font></h3>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The
        practice of production sharing will be a very important form of economic
        integration.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In production
        sharing, the resources of the developing countries (their abundant labor
        for traditional jobs) are brought together with the resources of the
        developed countries (their management, their technology, their educated
        people, their markets and purchasing power).&nbsp;<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Production
        sharing makes very high demands on design, marketing, and quality
        control, and even higher ones on planning, organizing, integrating, and
        coordinating.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>But it renders secondary, if not unimportant, capital
        investment, which is the traditional means of control and integration.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>It requires no more than a minimum of capital investment in the
        developing country.&nbsp;<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">But
        global value chain configuration is not a new phenomenon. A larger share
        of manufacturing was “multinational” before<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>World War I than it is today.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>And before 1914, no one thought that such “multinational”
        companies were anything extraordinary.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Fiat in Italy, for instance, was founded in Turin on New Year’s
        Day 1900.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>By 1903 or 1905,
        Austro-Fiat, the wholly owned Austrian subsidiary, was quite a bit
        larger than the parent company, for the old Austro-Hungarian Empire was
        a far bigger and more developed market than the Italy of 1900.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Austro-Fiats, which were cars designed in Turin but made in
        Vienna, were even adopted as the staff cars for the Austro-Hungarian
        Army.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Similarly, Siemens,
        founded in Germany around 1856, was by the 1860s larger in Great Britain
        and in Russia than in its original German markets.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Great Britain was the most highly developed country of Europe and
        of the world, so the British Siemens had a much bigger market than the
        parent company, which, until 1880 or so, was still operating in a
        developing country.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And
        Russia between 1860 and 1880 had a boom in railway construction that
        made Siemens, then the foremost European supplier of telegraph
        equipment, a monopoly supplier.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Three
        months after Edison had demonstrated his first, still very primitive,
        incandescent light bulb in New Jersey, his light bulbs were available
        for sale in Great Britain and soon thereafter in Japan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>A few months after Alexander Graham Bell had displayed his
        telephone in the United States, Bell telephones were being installed in<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>most European countries, as well as in Japan.&nbsp;<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">It
        was taken for granted in the last half of the nineteenth century and up
        to World War I that the successful company, and especially the
        innovating one, would immediately become a “multinational.” <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">These
        developments came to a halt with World War I.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>All that happened after World War II was that the old
        developments were revived.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And,
        just as the developments before World War I had been primarily between
        and within developed countries, so was the development after World War
        II.&nbsp;<o:p>

        <h3 align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4" color="#3333FF">The
        changing profile of MNCs</font></h3>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">From
        now on, the multinational corporation (MNC) may look quite different.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>It is likely to be a marketing rather than a manufacturing
        company. It will be multinational because it knows how to market goods,
        wherever produced, in the markets of the developed countries.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>It will be a management company, exercising managerial control,
        through technology and design.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Tomorrow’s
        MNC is likely to be a small or medium-sized company rather than a
        conspicuous giant which attracts unwanted political attention.&nbsp;<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A
        medium-sized company rather than a large company has the flexibility to
        engage in production sharing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Such
        sharing requires the ability to shift fast – in design, in production,
        in marketing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And here the
        large company, which has to “plan” ten years ahead (not because the
        market requires it but because of its own size and complexity) is at a
        decided disadvantage.&nbsp;<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The
        relationship between MNCs and governments may also change. Today,
        governments in many developing countries demand capital investment by
        their own nationals as a condition for a foreign company to start a
        business in their country.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Effectively,
        they insist on subsidizing companies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>This is the only thing this demand for participation by domestic
        capital can accomplish.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>But the demand also misses the point: the one thing to
        require of companies from abroad is that they create export earnings and
        jobs based on exports.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Very
        few governments in the developing countries understand this as yet,
        except the pragmatic Chinese in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>But some others like the Andean Pact countries are also learning
        fast.&nbsp;<o:p>

        <h3 align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4" color="#3333FF">The
        global paradox</font></h3>
        <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Economically,
        the world has become integrated and interdependent as never before.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>While the world economy is increasingly integrated, the world
        polity is, increasingly fragmented; and the process of political
        disintegration has clearly not run its course.&nbsp;<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Prior
        to the late sixteenth century, economic and political systems were quite
        separate. The modern national state was built on the principle that
        political territory and economic territory must be congruent, with the
        unity of the two forged by the governmental control of money.</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In
        1914, at the outbreak of World War I, there were fifty independent
        countries in the world, twenty of them in Europe and twenty in the
        Americas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Today, there are
        almost two hundred, some of them smaller than a country or a township in
        traditional European countries, and much smaller than countries in the
        western part of the United States.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Still, all claim to be “sovereign,” with their own armed
        services, their own bureaucracy, their own diplomatic corps, their own
        seat in the United Nations – and their own capacity to make a nuclear
        bomb.&nbsp;<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">There
        is thus an increasing conflict between the fundamental trends in the
        economy, which push toward integration, and the fundamental trends in
        the world polity, which push toward fission.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>And there is an increasing conflict between the pretensions of
        the political authority, the government of the national state, and its
        impotence in the economic sphere.&nbsp;<o:p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">All
        enterprises are becoming “double-headed monsters,” which depend for
        their performance on professionals who are dedicated to their discipline
        rather than to the institution. Traditionally professionals have
        resisted attempts to make them accountable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>But today, their performance is being measured and monitored<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>closely. It is no longer a question whether professionals should
        be held accountable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
        question is only whether they will develop their own standards or have
        standards imposed upon them.&nbsp;<o:p>

        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Job
        security for employees is desirable. But this has been taken too far by
        some countries. To lay off an employee in a country like Belgium
        requires “separation pay.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This
        prevents people from being laid off.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>But for every person whose job is thus saved, two or three may
        not be hired.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Some
        businesses need up to 20 percent more employees but hire no one at all.
        This is clearly due to the fear of redundancy liability.&nbsp;<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">What
        is needed is a clear, open, and firm commitment to the livelihood,
        productive employment, and placement of people.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>This should not be an unlimited commitment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Employees with less than ten years of employment in an industry
        do not need it. They are young enough to place themselves.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Nor do people who are old enough for early retirement need it;
        they have the financial foundation for economic security.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>But for manual and clerical workers aged thirty to fifty-five or
        sixty, a commitment to job security is necessary. At the same time,
        there must also be a commitment to anticipating redundancies, to
        retraining people, and to placing them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;<o:p>
