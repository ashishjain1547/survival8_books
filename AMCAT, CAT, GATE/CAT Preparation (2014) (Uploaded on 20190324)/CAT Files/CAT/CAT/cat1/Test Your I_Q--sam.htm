<H1>TEST YOUR I.Q. </H1></CENTER>
<HR>
<BR>
<H2>IMPORTANT! Read These Instructions First</H2>
<P>This test has been carefully designed to measure the general intelligence 
level of both adults and children 9 years or older. If you follow the 
instructions below, the test will give you an accurate rating of your I.Q. </P>
<H2>A.INSTRUCTIONS</H2>
<P>
<OL>
  <LI>You have 45 minutes to answer the 60 questions. Do not exceed this time 
  limit. 
  <LI>Answer all questions. If you do not know the answer - guess. Guessing has 
  been considered in the scoring. Do not leave any questions unanswered. 
  <LI>If a question seems to have more than one answer or no correct answer at 
  all, pick what you consider to be the best of the choices given. These 
  questions are purposely designed to test your ability to think and reason. 
  <LI>If a child is taking the test the parent should make certain the child 
  understands the instructions and sample questions before he begins. If the 
  child is a very poor reader, the parent may read the test questions to him, 
  but he must not help him in any way with the answers. If the child is given 
  any help, the test score will not reflect an accurate I.Q. </LI></OL>
<H2>B. SAMPLE QUESTIONS</H2>
<P>Carefully study the following sample questions before beginning the test. 
</P>I. In some questions you will be asked to make a comparison. <BR>Example: 
Which one of the five makes the best comparison? <BR>Boat is to water as 
airplane is to: <BR>SUN - GROUND - WATER - SKY - TREE <BR><BR>The answer is sky. 
A boat travels through water. This can be compared to an airplane which travels 
through the sky. <BR><BR>You will also be asked to compare designs. <BR>Example: 
Which one of the five makes the best comparison? <BR>
<CENTER><IMG src="Test Your I_Q--sam_files/sample2.gif"></CENTER><BR><BR>The 
answer is C. A circle which is divided into two parts can be compared to a 
square which is also divided into two parts. <BR><BR>II. In some questions, you 
will be given a group of five things. Four of them will have something in 
common; they will be similar in some way. You will be asked to choose the one 
which is not similar to the other four. <BR>Example: Which one of the five is 
least like the other four? <BR>DOG - CAR - CAT - BIRD - FISH <BR><BR>The answer 
is car. The others are all living animals. A car is not alive. <BR><BR>These 
questions may also have designs. <BR>Example: Which one of the five is is least 
like the other four? <BR>
<CENTER><IMG src="Test Your I_Q--sam_files/sample1.gif"></CENTER><BR><BR>The 
answer is D. The others are all made with straight lines. A circle is a curved 
line. <BR><BR>III. In some questions you will be given numbers, or letters, 
which are in a certain order. They follow some pat- tern of arrangement. 
However, one of them will not fit. You will be asked to choose the one which 
does not fit into the pattern. <BR>Example: Which one of the numbers does not 
belong in the following series? <BR>1 - 3 - 5 - 7 - 9 - 10 - 11 - 13 <BR><BR>The 
answer is 10. Starting with 1, the odd numbers are arranged in order, 10 is an 
even number which does not fit in the series. <BR><BR>IV.There will also be some 
problems which you will be asked to solve. These will not require any difficult 
math. Instead, they will be testing how logical you are - that is, how well do 
you think. <BR><BR>You are now ready to begin the test. Read each question 
carefully and write your answers on a piece of paper and compare your results 
with the correct ones AFTER you have completed the test. You have 45 minutes. 
<BR><BR><BR>Before you begin please note that this site is hosted for free by 
Geocities. This means that there is a limit to how many users can take the test 
simultaneously. Therefore, if you get an error message saying either the test 
or, later, that the answers are not there, this is because too many users are 
taken the test right at this moment. Please try again an hour later. I'm sorry 
for the inconvenience. <BR>
