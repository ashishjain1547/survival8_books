I am sure that most of the people who are serious about it will be able to make a
mark. Therefore, i would like to suggest something to those who are yet
undecided, who yet are in first or second year. They should start reading a lot,	lot of novels if they can. Editorials a must and general improvement in english
not only in terms of vocabulary but also in day to day speaking. because this is
the only area which is hard to master in a span of 6-7 months.
