Subject: My SP Jain GI experience 

My GI exp pretty much in q&a went on a bit like this:

> marketing fresher female ,IM (2 of us) 1 from infy bangalore 
,Finance (1 from infy again ! ),marketing another 2-3 years exp gy 
(pune ,swedish MNC) and another ops exp guy


Kicked off with intros:

My intro was good (i guess ) - Am blah blah working for TATA's 
for the last 4 + 1/2 years I worked in geographies of south 
,east,west africa,south east asia,mid-east and south 
asia,domains,technologies,roles,projects,education 
,parents,hobbies etc..


(panel)about your present project ?
explained about project and implementation, actvities ,standard 
chartered bank and client


(panel)clients of the project and how they use?
i practically gave them a qwiky intro to our project


does the bank make money on this project ?
one of the most profitable projects of the bank,major portion of 
the bank's transactions come thorugh this project 


what after mba ?
in medium to long term want to do research focussing on areas 
of info mgmt + emerging markets(i.e bottom of pyramid)


hobbies ?
travelling ,thanks to my job and personally ,adventure sports like 
rafting and bungi jumping,volunteering, contributing articles, 
travelogues to magazine


(panel)Any questions to us ?

(me and it's question time ) How do you encourage / Do you 
encourage students to take up assignments in Non- Profit 
organizations post MBA?

(panel)We have DOCC and students do socially relevant 
projects.......etc
(me again)I mean post MBA ,sir?

(panel)We had 1 student who worked for NGO and now applied 
to LSE,and we will be happy if students choose this path may not 
be rewarding financially but has other career advantages...(i 
liked the answer ,very true )

(in brief about others : infy IM had to sing a rafi song as his hobby 
was singing,fresher female said she was reading Da Vinci code 
but could'nt expalin convincingly the story or plot , marketing 
fellow said somethign about importing goods to be sold at 
premium in India ,and use india as export base to produce 
same products here in pune !!!,IT guy applying for finance was 
asked about coimbatore )

 

GI2: (Brigadier and faculty)
This time 4 candidates - 4 months exp from infy for mkting 
,finance guy from prev GI again from infy,IM from CSC Indore and 
me !

Intros as usual 

My q&a:
Brigadier - you mentioned about adventure sports ,what was the 
most recent one?
I went on white water rafting trip on the zambezi river in sep 2004 
ending, considered grade 5 by the british rafting association,i.e 
extremely dangerous and high waves, day long rafting trip takes 
you from zambia to zimbabwe

(faculty) How does it help you in your life /career?
Rafting is all about team work,working in unision and following 
your leader any silly mistake and everyone's in water 


Future Plans ?
Research based career in medium-long term in IM + Emerging 
markets


What you don't like about TCS? 
Need for Hi performance work culture ,similar to GE vitality curve

Removing bottom 10 is too drastic?
Bottom 10 % can be counselled first and their objectives and 
role clearly definded and removal only in worst case scenario

If you are offered a role in TCS post MBA,would you consider it?
Yes,love to


Whims/Fancy?
I want to be known as the greatest management thinker and 
business philosopher of this century
(others fancies ranged from playing cricket for India ....etc)

Like who?
Drucker and Prahlad


(panel)Team work as in TCS?
(me) And am sure , other companies too 

Overall am optimistic about the GI, lot depends on the weightage 
they give for all aspects

posting itself is not long enough) ---> http://nomad-

Take up one idea. Make that one idea your life - think of it, dream 
of it, live on idea. Let the brain, muscles, nerves, every part of 
your body, be full of that idea, and just leave every other idea 
alone. This is the way to success.[IMG]
