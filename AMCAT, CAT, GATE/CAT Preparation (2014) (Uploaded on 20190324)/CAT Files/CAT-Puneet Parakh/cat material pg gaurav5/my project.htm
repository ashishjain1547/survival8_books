<TR>
<TD width="90%" colSpan=4>&nbsp; DHANRAJ Nayar studied the audience in front of him. Twenty-two men sat there, waiting for the session to begin. He greeted them with a warm smile and asked: "Are the people from the components business and systems and services well mingled?" </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;&nbsp; There was an embarrassed silence after which someone said: "That side is Gapro, this side is us." Nayar winced. `Them' and `us'. Who was `us', he wondered, annoyed.<BR>&nbsp; Michael Wood, the human resources (HR) director for Asia, who sat a foot away from where Nayar stood, looked up, his eyebrows arching up. "That's what we will discuss soon," whispered Nayar, as he presented Wood to the audience. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="75%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; Nayar was the HR head of Elrax India and what he had just heard augured well for the theme of his discussions with Wood, later in the day. It had been 15 months since Elrax commenced operations in India and Wood's visit was specifically to review how the Elrax ideology had spread in the Indian team. <BR>&nbsp; In December 1997, Elrax International, as part of its India entry strategy, took over two companies in Baroda -- Bristol Components, which made components for infrastructure projects, and Gapro Consultants, which implemented projects. Other takeovers were on the cards, but with Bristol and Gapro in the bag, Elrax commenced operations. It was, in a sense, a new business for Elrax, for in no other market did it have components and project installation as joint businesses. </TD>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="25%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\5.GIF"></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Now, Bristol and Gapro shared an interesting relationship. For most of its projects, Gapro sourced its component requirements from Bristol. Bristol, in turn, also nosed around for customer jobs, partnered Gapro and monitored project installation and quality control. Of course, these were few, for Bristol was mostly a component manufacturer and had a good reputation in the market, thanks mainly to its English parentage. By the mid-nineties, Bristol, UK, began to lose interest in India. It was exiting the components business across the world, and so the Indian subsidiary was offered to Elrax. So the sale was understood by the Indian subsidiary as being purely for business and strategic reasons. On the other hand, the east European parent of Gapro found its Indian arm unprofitable and tedious to administer, and thus sold the company. Not surprisingly, the Gapro employees felt that they were not good enough. <BR>&nbsp; Nayar could see that they felt that Elrax had bailed them out. That was combined with an awe of Elrax, the big, smart US company. And this feeling came to the fore all the time. For instance, at the `Welcome to the Elrax Family' evening, Ashwini Singh, senior manager at Gapro, had said: "We are grateful to be part of Elrax. It's an honour to be part of such a great company. We do hope we will meet your expectations and match your standards of excellence." And Pradeep Kumar, speaking for Bristol, said: "This combination can only be good for all of us. Elrax will add to our strength and we will add to theirs." <BR>&nbsp; Elrax saw the erstwhile customer-supplier relationship between Bristol and Gapro as an advantage. But the difference between the two was reflected in the places where they used to work. Gapro had its offices in Madia House, which was not a very well maintained building. The lifts barely worked and as you climbed the stairs to the fourth floor office, you couldn't help noticing the chipped walls, broken banisters and the huge blotches of paan on the walls. <BR>&nbsp; Bristol, on the other hand, was located in Jay Plaza, and although it had seen better days, was better maintained. The first two floors had marble steps; luckily for Bristol, its office was on the second floor, and the marble lent it an air of opulence. <BR>&nbsp; Thus although it was Gapro which executed and implemented the jobs, it was Bristol which bustled with activity, because all meetings were held at Jay Plaza. As Kumar said: "Madia House is a mess. Even a dog won't wander into it by mistake. How then do we take our clients there?" 
<P><A target="_parent" class=punch>Bristol and Gapro had a supplier-customer relationship before the merger. However, Bristol's managers considered themselves superior to those at Gapro, treating the latter with disdain.</A></P>
<P>&nbsp; So over time Gapro had come to be known as the Madia House office and with it also acquired Bristol's displeasure that was once reserved only for the building. The arrangement continued after the takeover, since Elrax was yet to find office space. And the two divisions continued to be referred to as Madia House and Jay Plaza. <BR>&nbsp; For Nayar this was undesirable and every time he got a chance he told Hutton, the country manager, that an integration plan had to be put in place. But Hutton had a different viewpoint. "We hardly know these people, even if we know their companies," said Hutton. "Don't rush, observe them for six months and then draw up your plan." But Nayar worried. "Let us at least restructure the business operations and form more cohesive and mixed teams," he suggested. "It is important that they drop their old customer-supplier relationship." </P></TD></TR>

<TD width="80%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; For Nayar this was undesirable and every time he got a chance he told Hutton, the country manager, that an integration plan had to be put in place. But Hutton had a different viewpoint. "We hardly know these people, even if we know their companies," said Hutton. "Don't rush, observe them for six months and then draw up your plan." But Nayar worried. "Let us at least restructure the business operations and form more cohesive and mixed teams," he suggested. "It is important that they drop their old customer-supplier relationship." <BR>&nbsp; "That relationship is but natural," said Hutton. "After all, they were supplier and customer once. Even now, don't forget, Gapro will be an internal customer of Bristol. But these differences will sort themselves out over time. We will work on the Elrax ethos and everything else will fall in place." </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; And Hutton worked on the Elrax ethos. He brought in Elrax's performance management system, quality management and audit systems. While the feeling at Bristol was that 'all this is just a small tinkering with our systems', Gapro was stunned by the sophistication and detail. For Gapro hardly had any system in its old days. Just a set of forms to be filled and despatched to a faceless name far away. But now, in the face of Elrax's systems, Ashwini depended on Kumar for every little move he had to make, thereby allowing Bristol to dictate even Gapro's operations. Now since Elrax was combining components and service for the first time, and there were no laid-down systems for operations, Bristol slowly elbowed out every Gapro system and the Gapro team cowered in submission. Increasingly, it became apparent to Nayar that the integration of the two companies was not going to be smooth. "This is not one of those regular integrations," he warned his director. "As far as buying into the Elrax ethos is concerned, there is no conflict, since both are delighted with the takeover. But because one was superior to the other, there will be an undercurrent of domination by Bristol if we do not address that first." <BR>&nbsp; "Just wait for a year," said Hutton. "Let my successor move in. He can take the decision on what is best for the business." <BR>&nbsp; The person who was chosen to succeed Hutton was the general manager (business operations) of Bristol, Atul Jain. Nayar did not think that was a good idea. "It would be better if a dispassionate third party is brought in as the managing director," he suggested. <BR>&nbsp; But the parent company did not agree. "Where are we going to find a person who understands the details and intricacies of this business as well as these guys?" asked Hutton. "This is a technically driven business, so let us not have too many new variables. We need continuity to get a headstart in the market. Components manufacturing is critical to the end quality of the service business. It is wise that we appoint a Bristol man as managing director, and later we will see what to do." <BR>&nbsp; Jain was not partial or biased, but Nayar felt he was still full of Bristol and its past. And Jain was overwhelmed by the enormity of his new position and by Elrax. He felt his new position was also a function of the greatness of Bristol. So every once in a while, Jain would remark: "I see a lot of similarities between Bristol and Elrax. How similar our approach is." <BR>&nbsp; Like Jain, Gapro, too, looked for similarities, and not finding it, believed that Bristol was in fact the better of the two. To make matters worse, a new inference was drawn that `whatever Elrax is in India today is really Bristol', and the Bristol people started wallowing in that superiority. <BR>&nbsp; Three months after Jain had taken over, Nayar met him in his new office and appealed to Jain. "We need to shed all these old identities we are carrying. Why don't we start a new Elrax cultural integration, where we shuffle the entire team and create a new team of components and services and a coordination team comprising both? There will be terrific opportunities to upgrade people and skills, find new opportunities for growth for employees and even learn new skills." <BR>&nbsp; But Jain's response surprised Nayar. "These Gapro people are rather slow on the uptake. It would be a big risk to try what you are suggesting. We need to refresh the people there, decide who we want to keep and who we want retired from that side. We must give it some time." <BR>&nbsp; What business, wondered Nayar. Will there be any business at all if this rift and difference stays? Why, even the country manager feels they are them and we are us. Bristol is going to decide who it is going to retain from Gapro, he thought. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="75%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; It was a unique situation. Elrax India now encountered two companies with entirely different pulls and pushes, different stages of development, people with different skill sets. While both of them had their own set of products and customers, the point was that neither was performing very brilliantly. To add to that, the takeover by Elrax also meant an entirely new vision of the market, the business and, of course, targets that were sacred. <BR>&nbsp; Thus, while the individual revenues of the two companies were in the vicinity of Rs 15-18 crore, Elrax had set a target of Rs 100 crore for the next five months. If Gapro was taken aback, Bristol was less alarmed. As Kumar of Bristol told Ashwini: "It's not difficult, we (read Bristol) can manage. We have had tough taskmasters before and we have always been profitable. But you need to smarten up and keep all systems in place." <BR>&nbsp; Ashwini was enthused. Speaking to Kumar always comforted him. "How are you going to do it?" he asked him. </TD>
<TD width="25%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\7.GIF"></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; "It's not difficult," replied Kumar with ease. "We could have done it long ago. After all, isn't the market the same? The market hasn't grown because Elrax has come in; it was always there. It just requires the right combination of intellect and money power to rake in the business. If our parent company had not lost interest in the last four-five years, we would be competing with Elrax!" he said with a grin. <BR>&nbsp; Nayar could see the growing confidence at Bristol, but it was Gapro's timidity that worried him. Would it be able to handle such a vast services function, he wondered. While he was trying to get them together as one company, the huge cultural abyss caused him anxiety. <BR>&nbsp; The Bristol people were quicker, street-smart and savvy. In contrast, the Gapro people were diffident, quiet and withdrawn. Nayar couldn't help wondering how these men would survive in Elrax. In fact, he wondered how they had managed to stay afloat even in Gapro. After all they had foreign parents and demands must have been placed on them in terms of conversation and performance. <BR>&nbsp; But some clues lay in what Ashwini said: "The parents came down thrice a year. Their visit was very businesslike.They stayed at the Taj, but no meeting was held there. We met in the office and they brought along their bottles of mineral water." <BR>&nbsp; In both companies, the senior positions were all held by 50-plus men. Senior positions had perforce been accorded to the older managers, because they believed business maturity came with age. In the restructuring, therefore, Nayar had to consider the cultural issues of having younger divisional heads or even elevating the younger managers at these companies. The senior managers at Bristol were not perturbed. They still felt they were in the reckoning, that they were still with it, still smart.... But the seniors at Gapro were worried. It was apparent that Elrax worldwide had a much younger set of employees and that was going to be the trend in India. Did the Elrax people think they were smart enough to take part in the growth? <BR>&nbsp; Whatever the alarm they had felt initially over the targets, the teams were also achieving it, thanks to their own resilience -- and an anxiety to keep their jobs. Most senior managers, unused to the tremendous pressure of managing such a large portfolio, worked harder than they ever had. But it took its toll -- there were a confusion of systems, old versus new, Madia House versus Jay Plaza. The last mentioned summed up for Nayar the crux of the problem. What it said was: "Yes, we are all Elrax, but you are Madia House and I am Jay Plaza, which means I am better than you." 
<P><A target="_parent" class=punch>Nayar was worried that the Bistol people were getting the upper hand in the merged entity, relegating Gapro's managers to the sidelines. He felt the two groups had to be integrated.</A></P>
<P>&nbsp; Then, there also was the business of aligning themselves to the Elrax ideology. Every meeting, however insignificant, was prefixed with an Elrax value statement, the Elrax way of life, not to mention that much of the action was now happening at the Globe Trade Centre office of Elrax which was opulent, slick and knitted together by a set of systems and a degree of automation that neither team could grasp. <BR>&nbsp; On the other hand, there was the problem of actually understanding what all the new values meant. For instance, Elrax prescribed a reduction in the bureaucracy. But Ashwini continued to be personally involved with reports and statements. He sent daily reports on costs, project status and revenues to Kumar at Jay Plaza, deferring to Bristol's superiority and because Jain insisted on this. Simultaneously, Ashwini was also sending a different set of reports on the new Elrax formats to his new bosses in the US on different parameters, and, in the process getting snowed under by paperwork. <BR>&nbsp; All in all, their lives had turned topsy turvy. Not only were they now trying to align with Elrax, but also with each other. So it was actually three personalities coming together, with Bristol subconsciously calling the shots, Gapro struggling to gain Bristol's acceptance and constantly reminding itself that it was now an Elrax company. And Elrax was an enigma -- world class, the world's best, which was waltzing into the country and buying one company after another. <BR>&nbsp; Then there was Bristol, a 100-year-old company worldwide, a name that had bewildered Gapro. Highly systems-driven, very British, very meticulous, a good lineage of managers, aggressive and savvy. There was Gapro worldwide, which was a product of many mergers and acquisitions since the world war, whose management ethos was inspired and drawn from military practices. Most of its managers had never met and many did not even know who their boss was. The parent company had never invested much in Gapro, making its employees feel that they weren't anything more than a set of jobbers in boiler suits to implement the numerous projects. Bristol was only one of its suppliers of parts and components, and some projects came Gapro's way through its recommendations. That had led to some sort of subservience at Gapro, which was grateful for the business. Gapro did not grow as savvily as Bristol did, but Bristol wasn't so salient either. Today, faced with the streamlined Elrax, whose focus was excellence, growth, profits, both suffered varying levels of trepidation. <BR>&nbsp; Nayar could see the 22 faces before him listening in rapt attention to Wood extolling the Elrax heritage. "So, that is Elrax," Wood was saying, "a company that has drawn the spirit of resilience and perseverance from a young man who gave birth to a germ of an idea after the war had destroyed the spirit of every individual in his land. From there he went about slowly and steadily building a conglomeration of businesses and by the twenties was a leading name in a number of branded consumer and industrial goods. That man is our chairman, Howard Davies, whose spirit we have transmitted to every generation. That is what makes us world class. Today we are a Fortune 500 company, highly regarded by the discerning American public, most respected by the European Community. You should be proud to be part of such a great heritage. Your lives are going to change, people in the marketplace are going to look at you differently. That you are from Elrax will change the way they do business with you, talk to you, even greet you," he said amid laughter. <BR>&nbsp; It did not make sense to Nayar and he said so to Wood: "As long as they think of themselves as Gapro and Bristol, or superior and inferior, the Bristol ethos will be all-pervading." "It's time to stop referring to them as such," said Wood. "Gapro and Bristol are now only names in the purchase contract and that is already two years old. They are Elrax members," he reminded Nayar. "The differences will persist as long as you separate them in your mind." <BR>&nbsp; "But first there must be an attempt to physically integrate the two teams," said Nayar. "Only when they sit together, work together and ride the same lift and suffer the same tea boy will there be a real coming together." <BR>&nbsp; Nothing had really changed, felt Nayar. The takeover had had little impact. The two companies continued to work as before. Post-takeover, Elrax passed on all new business to the components division which in turn was getting it implemented by Gapro. Unwittingly, Elrax had reinforced Bristol's superiority, he felt. <BR>&nbsp; "What have we achieved?" asked Nayar. "All we have done is bought two companies. What have we done to bridge the differences between the two?" <BR>&nbsp; "We brought in every Elrax system!" said Wood. "We took them through the Elrax ideology.... You need to have an audit of why that has not affected them." <BR>&nbsp; "Can we change the way they feel about each other by merely bringing in the Elrax system? I don't think this is a simple integration issue, Mr Wood. There's much more to it," said Nayar. "Yes, we superimposed the performance management process, the quality management system, but we have not integrated them in the real sense. Thus we are not ready to say `You are no longer Gapro or Bristol, but we are Elrax'. Yet superficially we are saying it is a wonderful thing to come together as one. In our minds we are not allowing it to happen."</P></TD></TR>

<TD width="80%" colSpan=3><B>Aquil Busrai</B> i<I>s the executive director of human resources (India &amp; Saarc countries and global software division, Asia-Pacific) at Motorola.<BR></I>&nbsp;&nbsp; IT IS time to consider replacing Dhanraj Nayyar. Fifteen months into the merger and he is still groping for direction, mesmerised by the events around him. So much so that he has become a mere bystander, witnessing the drama unfolding before him and unable to influence its direction.Transfixed, he has done very little to influence the change except perhaps for some wishful thinking about the way the management team in Elrax should conduct itself.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;&nbsp; Nayyar has abandoned the charter of human resources (HR) being a catalyst for organisation change. He has looked for neat, traditional solutions in the merged Elrax, looked for well-defined round pegs in round holes and as a result missed the opportunity for some proactive and creative HR interventions which would have brought about a much smoother transition. <BR>&nbsp; A corporate merger is stressful for everyone involved. People worry about losing their jobs. They worry about who their new bosses will be. They worry about being relocated to some other place. They worry about the future and fret about the present. The first task in managing a merger is to allay those fears by providing stability, structure and honest answers to hard questions. Only after people feel secure can one get down to the difficult business of combining the companies that have now merged. This is one area in which Nayyar and his HR team could have taken a lead. <BR>&nbsp; The aftermath of the merger requires several different kinds of strategy. One kind is an operating strategy, which, in the long run, will determine whether the merger is a success or a failure. But almost as important -- and in the short run perhaps even more important -- is a communication strategy: a clear, consistent plan for getting out to critical constituencies the key message about the merger. The first step towards managing the people part of the merger is psychological -- to restore a sense of order and confidence that there is productive work to be done in building the future of the unified organisations. <BR>&nbsp; Ultimately, success in human resource issues will hinge on making good on the economic promise of unification. Nayyar and his HR team could, and should, have championed this cause. <BR>&nbsp; Both the Bristol and Gapro managements have not identified themselves fully with Elrax's ethos. As a result, the prevailing sub-cultures have been further reinforced.&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="75%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; The Bristol management's confidence in its own ability, and Gapro's lack of it has further alienated both of them from the common Elrax culture. But then, simply grafting the corporate culture of the acquiring company onto the acquired one does not usually work -- or at best, takes a very long time. <BR>&nbsp; The sheer dynamism and confidence levels of the erstwhile Bristol managers have put them in the driver's seat in the amalgamated Elrax. But the same management has not capitalised on the strength of the parent company's systems and processes. Instead, it has taken upon itself the task of 'reforming' the management practices of the erstwhile Gapro.</TD>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="25%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\9.GIF"></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;&nbsp; All these are wasteful practices and are in no way contributing to making a stronger Elrax in India.&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; Mergers offer business leaders a chance to pursue innovative and creative solutions to tough problems. In this context, the Elrax management has made its processes and systems available to the merged entity more as a matter of routine. No serious efforts have been made to integrate the parent company's processes with the business needs of the newly acquired companies. Perhaps because the merger has not adversely impacted the business deliveries, giving an overall impression that everything is running smoothly after the merger. Why fix something that is not broken?</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Most corporate change programmes mistake means for ends, processes for outcomes. The solution, however, lies in focusing on results, not activities. <BR>&nbsp; Consider a corporate setting: an acquiring company looks at its partners' processes and systems, deems it inferior, and then sets about installing systems and processes identical to its own. But the right position for the acquirer to take is: "My system may be better, but is it the best?" <BR>&nbsp; A merger is a chance to establish new and higher standards for the whole organisation, not an excuse to maintain the status quo -- for either side. The Elrax management has not invested the time to examine this aspect. <BR>&nbsp; The new leader, Atul Jain, has relied heavily on his Bristol experience, going to the extent of even cloning some of Bristol's management practices in the new Elrax. He means well. He wants improvement initiatives implemented. But his vision is limited to his Bristol background. He has yet to grasp the power of the parent company, Elrax. <BR>&nbsp; Besides, what he considers improvements are often modifications of Gapro's system to make them similar to that of Bristol's. All these have very little impact on the overall business results of Elrax.&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5><A target="_parent" class=punch>No serious efforts have been made by the elrax management to integrate its processes with the business needs of the newly acquired companies</A></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;Often the performance improvement efforts of many companies have as much impact on operational and financial results as a ceremonial rain dance has on the weather. This "rain dance" is the ardent pursuit of activities that sound good, look good, and allow managers to feel good -- but in fact contribute little or nothing to bottomline performance. <BR>&nbsp; These programmes or processes become pet subjects in many organisations, a hallmark by which they are identified. These often include total quality, management empowerment, employee involvement and project processes.<BR>&nbsp; Companies introduce these programmes under the false assumption that if they carry out enough of the "right" improvement activities, actual performance improvement will inevitably materialise. At the heart of these programmes, which are essentially "activities centered", is a fundamentally flawed logic that confuses ends with means, processes with outcomes. What is needed is an infusion of "results-centered" programmes which begin by identifying the most urgently needed performance improvement plan and an action plan to implement them effectively. <BR>&nbsp; There is no reason for the Elrax management to acquiesce when their managers plead that they are already accomplishing just about all that can be done or that some factors beyond their control are blocking accelerated performance improvement. Such self-limiting ideas are exactly that: self-limiting. Instead, the Elrax management needs to recognise that there is an abundance of both underexploited capability and dissipated resources in the organisation and both of these need to be harnessed properly if the unified Elrax is to make a mark in the marketplace. <BR>&nbsp; Mergers involve high risks and high stress levels. The challenge can be overwhelming for a company. But mergers are embarked on by companies because they hold the promise of greater prosperity and growth. The first step towards realising this promise is to make the process of integration manageable, effective and timely.</TD></TR>

These issues are extremely relevant today, with the M&amp;A mania gaining momentum in the West and will, no doubt, happen in India too as the government pushes ahead with the next phase of reforms.<BR>&nbsp; Data collected during the last 10 years in Europe and the US indicate that a significant number of these mergers/acquisitions failed to achieve their objectives.&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;This was not because they were incorrect or inappropriate from the business strategy or financial point of view, but mainly because the time and effort that were spent on the cultural and people issues were not adequate. <BR>&nbsp; At the end of the day, organisations are fundamentally about people -- to paraphrase Abe Lincoln, 'of the people, by the people, for the people'. Not 'of money, by money, for money' or 'of systems, by systems, for systems'. The merger of Bristol and Gapro wasn't successful because it failed to pay attention to these aspects.&nbsp;&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="75%" colSpan=3>The problem began with the direction set by Elrax country manager Hutton. His was a classical top-down approach: he papered over the internal differences, leaving his successor to sort out the problems. In any event, his thinking was that "it soon won't be my problem so why tackle it", which was the first step to the failure of the merger. <BR>&nbsp; The problem was compounded by the selection of Atul Jain as Hutton's successor; Jain came from Bristol, the more 'successful' part of the merged entity. Given no core objectives on the culture and people front, Jain reinforced by his behaviour the superior-inferior division between Bristol and Gapro. </TD>

<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;Nayar, like most HR leaders, stayed within the boundaries of trying to 'influence' and 'facilitate' (rather than leading the process) and implementing diligently whatever the new owner, Elrax, wanted. He had all the right ideas -- breaking up the current identities by creating mixed teams, common objectives, common structures and so on. <BR>&nbsp; These were fundamental to the success of the merger, much more than having a common office. But, in his desire to conform, he didn't push hard enough, and, interestingly, ended up making his own life more difficult.

<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;To avoid such problems, it is critical to go though the process of due diligence before going ahead with an acquisition and/or a merger. Due diligence must extend beyond financial and technical issues to HR and systems. This helps in identifying and understanding potential problem areas, individuals and processes and provides enough time to develop a gameplan, whose execution can begin on day one of the acquisition. Had the differences between Bristol and Gapro been understood before the acquisition, Elrax could have avoided the current situation. <BR>&nbsp; Successful mergers happen because of the effort made in getting the people processes right. Leadership, teams, team membership along with processes that encourage dialogue, building a common future and burying the disparate pasts, are fundamental building blocks in creating synergy through mergers and acquisitions. <BR>&nbsp; When this happens successfully, the merged 'whole' will always be greater than the sum of its parts. </TD></TR>

<TR>
<TD width="99%" colSpan=4>&nbsp; SUKUMAR Sharma was agitated. His finance director was on the line from London, with, as he was saying, a `solution' to his problems. But `Suku' was far from pleased. "Suku, the latest verdict on India is 18 months. You understand?" asked Leon Carey.&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; "HQ has found this bright start-up artiste who has been slaving over our Nevada operations for India.&nbsp;He is pricey, but he is hot. He will either turn the whole thing around or pull the shutters down if that is his verdict. My bet is he will turn it around," said Carey.<BR>&nbsp; "What is he going to bring to my business which we can't do ourselves?" asked Suku. "You think we haven't tried every trick? The solution is very clear Carey: just set up the plant or allow us to outsource manufacturing. And importantly, allow us to enter the mid-priced segment. Why are you imposing this additional cost of Rs 1 crore per annum which I can ill afford? We could use the money to hire a sensible sales and distribution team and achieve better market reach and volumes in the other segments. Or even acquire a depreciated plant and start production. We can't afford these high-priced expats!"</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="75%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; Suku was the head of operations at Lexicon India, a chocolate and confectionery company. For four years he had been battling memories of a failed joint venture (JV), dealing with the home market and the parent company and trying to bridge the ideological gap with his country manager. He was also handling two jobs and 14 managers and praying each day for a miracle. Carey was adding a fresh chapter to his nightmare, he felt.<BR>&nbsp; Five years ago when it set up operations in India, Lexicon went through a nightmarish JV and a business that wouldn't take off. It had been through just about every complication that a new entrant could possibly encounter. Lexicon entered India in 1994 with Nimbus Foods, a medium-sized confectionery company located in Gujarat, as its partner.&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Nimbus made biscuits, chewing gum, boiled sweets and toffees -- a mix that suited Lexicon. For Lexicon was a successful chocolate company and the products it had planned for India in the first phase were premium chocolates and nutty bars. </TD>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="25%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\14.GIF"></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The understanding was that Nimbus would be the marketing arm for Lexicon and the latter would not compete in product lines in which Nimbus was present. Additionally, Lexicon could use Nimbus' plant to manufacture its high-end products.<BR>&nbsp; The joint venture arrangement was the best Lexicon could ask for. Manufacturing facilities combined with a readymade distribution network, which would take its premium products into the B-class towns, too, which research declared had a very high level of aspiration matched by a healthy disposable income. For Lexicon had concluded through an extensive survey that the Indian middle class was growing rapidly, taking the market for premium chocolates along with it. For the initial stages of the market entry, Nimbus' plant would suffice, but at a later stage, it was agreed that the joint venture would set up a state-of-the-art plant to manufacture the premium chocolates.<BR>&nbsp; But Lexicon's sales didn't pick up and stocks piled up at the Vadodara plant. Nimbus attributed the low offtake to teething trouble and assured Lexicon of growing retail interest. By mid-1995, however, report after report questioning the size of the middle class appeared in the media, sending the Lexicon team into an abyss of anxiety. Nimbus then began to complain that Lexicon's market estimates were too ambitious. The Lexicon team, on the other hand, concluded that Nimbus did not have the skills to market the premium products. <BR>&nbsp; When, at the end of the year, Nimbus' efforts did not lead to sales or orders, Lexicon, UK, began to examine the JV contract more keenly to press for performance. That was the time when Lexicon's plan to set up its own plant in Ahmedabad came up for discussion. Nimbus dithered and its managing director Suyash Tripathi threw up his hands. "Where do I bring the money from?" he asked. "What do I tell my shareholders when we are nowhere near the target sales for year one?" <BR>&nbsp; Tripathi had begun to lose faith in the partnership or in Lexicon's ability to make a dent on the market. The market, he saw, was not as responsive to Lexicon's chocolates as the plans had envisaged. Besides, biggies like Nestle and Cadbury had already turned aggressive and proactive and begun to launch their better-known brands. Lexicon's chocolates may be good, but the pricing was all wrong, the retailers claimed.&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; Naresh Sinha, Lexicon's country manager, decided he had enough. To the parent company he said: "This is absurd! The JV partner is going back on his word. Are we going to put our plans on hold just because Nimbus does not contribute to the plant?" In short, Sinha was recommending that Lexicon buy out Nimbus' share and go it alone in India. He had no doubts that Lexicon's bars would succeed. 
<P><A target="_parent" class=punch>When Lexicon India's Joint Venture Partner Nimbus - which manufactured and distributed the products - failed to deliver, Lexicon decided to do it alone. But that was not as easy as it sounded.</A></P>
<P>&nbsp; It was London's turn to balk. "But do you have the wherewithal and distribution strengths," it asked. There was no doubt that the relationship with Nimbus was now very fragile, but a divorce would queer the pitch further for Lexicon which at least had the use of Nimbus' Vadodara plant and its distribution network. "Retiring Nimbus is a matter of detail," explained the UK office, "but how are you going to generate the volumes?" Sinha was confident he could. According to him, volumes could be built if they entered the medium-end range of confectioneries and chewing gum. But as it stood, as long as the JV continued, Lexicon could not encroach on Nimbus' market. <BR>&nbsp; Nimbus and Lexicon parted company in early 1996 with an assurance from the parent company that Lexicon India would get an approval for a plant within six months. In the interim, Sinha would have to utilise the piled-up stocks and maybe import the products. Sinha was told in no uncertain terms that it was now up to him to deliver the viable volumes. <BR>&nbsp; It was not a happy situation for Sinha. He had to set up a sales team from scratch and create a distribution network in a market that was very competitive. Worse, he now had to worry about how he would source the goods for sales. Luckily for him, the only person he managed to hold back after the divorce was Sukumar Sharma, the operations manager who had worked closely with him. Fired by his new role, Suku helped draw up fresh business plans and sales strategies and drove his team towards his goal. Suku also managed to tie up with biscuit manufacturer Alpine Foods to distribute Lexicon's chocolates in India. Together they worked out an agreement with Alpine's distributors in the north and in western India for sales to these markets and the south. <BR>&nbsp; But one serious obstacle daunted him: London's stance that a plant could be set up only after a viable volume was achieved. Sinha had three options: one, manufacture on their own -- but the parent company refused to invest in a plant till the agreed volumes were met. Two, manufacture through a third party. Or three, import products. <BR>&nbsp; The most cost-effective route was to outsource manufacturing, but the parent company wouldn't hear of it. "In the candy and chocolate business, everything needs to be kept under wraps," said the UK head of operations. "Recipes and manufacturing processes are closely guarded secrets. We cannot share them with some third-party confectioner." <BR>&nbsp; Sinha argued there could be an arrangement like the one with Nimbus, where the manufacturing was done under closely guarded supervision. But the parent company would not hear of it. "After what we have faced with Nimbus, we are not going that route again. We have seen what the market is capable of; but you have to convince me with volumes for a plant to take shape," he said. <BR>&nbsp; The natural choice was to import. But that also needed investments in a semi-cold chain to carry the chocolates and transport them. Importing also meant a host of other skills and costs: an entire logistics function, a warehouse and the people. In short, Sinha did not feel Lexicon India was equipped to handle imports. Also, with the focus on sales, he would rather channel his funds and energies into building a market. <BR>&nbsp; There was a locational problem, too. Lexicon was headquartered in Delhi. So if it had to import, it would have to set up an office in Mumbai, Chennai or Calcutta, if not at all three cities so as to be closer to the ports. Suku thought about it. "That makes sense, but how can we afford it?" he asked. Instead he suggested that they speak to Alpine and convince its distributors in the three metros to take on the import function. "Logistically, too, that makes sense. They will be in control of the supply and distribution of the goods. We should work on that." <BR>&nbsp; Fortunately for Lexicon, Alpine was enthusiastic and so were its distributors. "We can do it, if all costs are to your account," they said. Lexicon India agreed. Its sales team worked the markets, canvassed for business, booked orders and passed it on to Lexicon UK which shipped the goods to Alpine's three distributors under their import order. The distributors, in turn, paid the sales proceeds to the parent company. Lexicon received a small commission for the sale it put through, which was not even enough to cover costs. But as Sinha said: "The idea is to generate demand and develop the market. Soon the plant will be in place and life will be wonderful."</P></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="36%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\15.GIF"> </TD>
<TD width="64%" colSpan=3>&nbsp;But life wasn't a bowl of cherries for Lexicon. Soon Alpine was complaining. The original agreement was only about distribution, but now it had the added bother of coping with arduous import procedures. Lexicon did not have a regional sales network, which made it difficult to ensure that the regional distributors processed their imports enthusiastically. Then again, if it took four weeks for a consignment to arrive from London, it took as long as three weeks to clear the material from the docks. All of this affected product quality and reduced shelf life. <BR>&nbsp; Sinha grew weary of all this. "How do we grow the market without consistent supply? Does the parent company realise what all this costs us in terms of time and effort? Why can't we simply set up a plant?" he asked.&nbsp; &nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; Already weighed down by the customs duty and administrative costs of managing the imports, Lexicon now could not afford to incur any more costs.&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; The business was now losing money and employee morale was at an all-time low.<BR>&nbsp; Worse, with all the time spent on walking a tightrope, managing and monitoring the imports, there was precious little left to woo the retail trade. Suku didn't even have the budget to hire regional sales staff. <BR>&nbsp; Yet Sinha wasn't about to give up. "We have come a long way," he tried telling the sales team. "We have to look at all these costs, even the dropping morale, as set-up costs. We are going to keep our chin up and get to the goal together!" For Sinha was determined. He had seen the business plans. Once the initial problems were overcome, Lexicon was going to unleash a host of exciting brands on hungry Indian consumers.<BR>&nbsp; Whether they believed him or not, at least they were willing to strategise their every step together. Arguments and debates were par for the course at Lexicon. "Look, my job is to manage the customer's orders, not his temper," said the sales head. "The administrative burden of importing is becoming an issue. I am building customers for ever, not for a single transaction. We have to do something about the import issue!" <BR>&nbsp; Sinha then made a momentous decision. "Yes, this has gone too far. Soon we will be manufacturing. We need to learn to handle logistics, so this is a good time to start trading activity as a prelude to manufacturing. So let us start importing directly in our name and set up a full-scale logistics function," he said. <BR>&nbsp; It was now Suku's turn to debate. "We are making too many short-term decisions based on a dream that we will soon have our own plant. The fact is, we are far away from our target. Can we afford these costs?" he asked. "We have a good product, good brands and probably a good market. What we need to do quickly is set up the plant or urge Lexicon, UK, to permit us to manufacture through third parties," he said to Sinha. <BR>&nbsp; The fact was that although sales had begun to grow, there was still no sign of the magic volume figure. Lexicon, UK's, insistence that India should sell only the eight varieties of premium chocolates was proving to be a stumbling block. But the low-value, high-volume ranges could be profitable only if Lexicon manufactured the products. Importing them would not be cost effective, it was felt. It was for this very reason that Sinha had not pushed UK for permission to trade in the mid-priced segments. "We must wait," he conceded. "Once we have the clearance to set up the plant, we can start all these product segments, set up more elaborate infrastructure." <BR>&nbsp; So on and so forth went the tussle between the parent's demand for volumes and the Indian subsidiary's desire to enter all product categories and the unresolved debate over manufacturing on its own versus outsourcing. There was no respite. It was even difficult to forecast the demand with any level of confidence, given the erratic supply and availability of the brands in the retail outlets. Suku was deeply annoyed by the apparent indifference of the parent company to the Indian subsidiary's plight. "The initial estimates and strategy were based on a middle class size of 350 million and its ability and inclination to pay for premium products," he tried explaining to Sinha. 
<P><A target="_parent" class=punch>Sinha, the Indian Country head, wanted Lexicon to enter all segments of the Confectionery Market instead of sticking only to premium products, but the parent company wouldn't hear of it.</A></P>
<P>&nbsp; "Now where's the sense in sticking to the old strategy of `premium range only' when it is very clear that such volumes cannot be had but at a loss and at least not in the next five years?" But there was opportunity in that error, Suku felt. Lexicon, which had planned to bring in only its premium products, could now relook at the dynamics and bring in all those low-value, high-volume products which would be enormously profitable if they were manufactured in India. To Sinha he said: "Don't push for trading Naresh. The arithmetic is clear -- volumes and profits lie in the middle and lower end ranges. You must convince UK on two counts: one, to either set up a plant or allow us to outsource. Two, enter the mid-priced and low-priced confectionery segments with our international brands." But Lexicon, UK, was so caught up with its image and fears that it refused to look at a market where only its lower-end products would find profitable markets. <BR>&nbsp; When Carey visited India in early 1998, he sat through a three-hour presentation on `Need for a changed vision'. At the end of it, he asked: "Tell me Suku, how are we going to justify that it is worthwhile remaining in India?" <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; "How do large multinationals take decisions on whether they should stay in a market or not?" asked Suku. "Based on profits, on volumes, on presence and long-term growth? You tell me, what is your vision? Never mind what your vision was four years ago. Let's say you have just completed a review of the Indian market and you have found that the middle class is 80 million. Would you enter India? Why do you want to enter India? For immediate profits? To grow a viable market here for the long term? To take part in the foods business in the belief that it is a viable and growing industry? Don't forget that none of the new entrants made profits in the first five or even seven years. Growing a market requires a heart of steel, a stomach of leather and a mind sharp as a razor. Why blame it on a wrong estimate? Your answer lies in your long-term vision," said Suku. <BR>&nbsp; "All that talk is academic, Suku," interjected Sinha. "The point is, we have the demand, we even have a workable distribution system through Alpine. I know that if the products are available, consumers will come by the hordes. Today the distributors are not adventurous with their offtake because I have no plant. No credibility. They are saying: `Set up a plant, manufacture, make your product available on demand.' I am not being allowed to do that," he said, addressing Carey.<BR>&nbsp; Carey went back, promising to `work on it'. Then the unusual happened. Believing that the poor showing was because the business was not being managed optimally, Lexicon, UK, decided to sack Sinha and send an expat manager from its home office. A belligerent Suku now decided to fight for survival. "It's clear to me that the parent company is pursuing a narrow vision by insisting on the premium range," he told Sinha. "If they will not invest in a plant, I am going to push for outsourcing and trading in the middle and lower ranges." <BR>&nbsp; Six months passed and no one was found to head the India business. Meanwhile, Lexicon India's managers ran the business to the best of their ability, happy at having saved the cost of a country head. For Suku, every rupee saved meant more money to hire more sales staff so that they could explore every new market, sell the volumes and attain the targets that would justify setting up their own plant. For the longer it delayed setting up the plant, the more the revenue loss. And that was one reason why Suku was rejecting Carey's offer of an expat country manager.<BR>&nbsp; "It will cost me my plant," said Suku confidently. <BR>&nbsp; "Don't exaggerate, Suku," Carey said. <BR>&nbsp; "It takes a lot of money to run an operation in India. Given our situation, we can't fritter it away. Now, don't send me a white elephant. I can run the business this way myself. Nothing strategic has been achieved in the last three years, despite having a country manager," said Suku. "Granted, we went wrong in our estimates, but so did so many others. But they all survived! The better companies have gone back to the drawing boards and altered their plans; they haven't quit. You compounded the problem by sticking to the premium mantra. Imports cannot be a permanent solution. Sooner or later we have to either set up our own plant or find a viable third party to outsource from. The size of the potential market is tremendous. So by setting up a plant, we won't be erring. But we'll be making a mistake if we stick to the current volume targets and the categories we are in. And that, Mr Carey, is why we are losing money. So let's take this decision now. We don't need to wait for an expat to fly here to decide!" he ended.</P></TD></TR>

<P>Dear Mr Sharma,<BR>&nbsp; I can understand how you feel about an expatriate coming to help the Indian operations. Having been so closely involved in your company's operations, you perhaps feel that everything that could have been done has been attempted.&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, I can even sense your frustration over your overseas principal's decision to get an expatriate country manager, when, deep in your heart, you feel that you would have made a far better country manager! </P></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Before we get on to the issue of addressing your feelings on this move, it may be worthwhile to study the issues dispassionately and explore what options are open to all the parties involved. <BR>&nbsp; Firstly, and this statement is not meant to console you, there are quite a few instances where the overseas organisation's visions for developing countries like ours are a little ahead of time. Theprojections of volumes are based and derived from aggregated data and therefore are not really rooted in the realities of the marketplace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, most multinationals want to make a guarded entry into a country like ours and progress rapidly only after they get the feeling that they have sufficiently found their bearings in the Indian market. <BR>&nbsp; Thirdly, it is quite common for multinationals to advise their affiliates to look at specific product segments, preferably in the premium range, rather than spread the product portfolio wide to cover the entire range. This is because a start-up organisation has limited resources and therefore it makes sense to put these resources into a focused area in a creative manner rather than spreading them. <BR>&nbsp; This also helps the organisation to continuously innovate and change the rules of the game rather than frittering away its energies and resources in me-too segments. Of course, these decisions also have to be taken after a thorough assessment of the local markets. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="63%" colSpan=4>&nbsp; Fourthly, there's a price to be paid in the short run for the `selective' strategy; this takes the form of losses. In this phase, it is wise not to make any investments in creating fixed assets (such as manufacturing facilities) and instead invest in market development and brand-building.<BR>&nbsp; Going by these, Lexicon's arrangement with Nimbus was perhaps the ideal choice. But every move after that caused the situation to worsen. When Nimbus `failed' on the volumes front, and assuming that Sinha's conclusion that the company did not have skills to market premium wares is correct, I wonder why Sinha did not recommend to the parent company that the joint venture with Nimbus be amended to include only manufacturing and that Lexicon's Indian operations could do the marketing on its own. </TD>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="37%"><IMG SRC="my project_images\17.GIF"> </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; After all, Nimbus erred only in marketing, not in manufacturing. It appears that Sinha had made up his mind about getting into the low-end segments as well and since this was not tenable in the existing Nimbus joint venture, he decided to call off the venture. This, according to me, was the first serious error in decision-making for which both Sinha and Lexicon, UK, are responsible. After that move, a catch-22 situation was sure to follow.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It occurs to me that in the light of the Indian experience, Lexicon, UK, is still not sure of the size of the Indian market and therefore wants to utilise the services of an experienced expatriate to address this crucial issue. The parent company has also realised that Sinha's termination of the Nimbus joint venture without really looking at alternative arrangements (in terms of modification of the joint venture arrangement) was not a wise move and therefore felt the need for another person to take a fresh look at this issue. 
<P><A target="_parent" class=punch>Sinha's termination of the Nimbus joint venture without putting alternative arrangements in place was not a wise move. </A></P>
<P>&nbsp; The new expat country manager, based on his experience, can reassess the premium market and if the size of the market looks interesting in the foreseeable future, can suggest creative solutions. He can, for example, revive the Nimbus joint venture, changing the agreement so that Nimbus does only the manufacturing. <BR>&nbsp; Or if putting up a manufacturing base is the only alternative, he could convince the UK office of the need to use the Indian base for exports to other countries, so as to facilitate better capacity utilisation in the initial stages. The more we apply our minds, the greater is the list of possible alternatives. <BR>&nbsp; Do not worry about the Rs 1 crore cost to the Indian operations that the expat head will entail; Lexicon, UK, is likely to view this as a small investment compared to the cost of the outcome of a wrong strategic decision. <BR>&nbsp; I would suggest that you accept the expat country manager with an open mind and communicate to him effectively the value of the experience in building the brand and furthering the marketing operations. If things work out favourably, then sooner or later you will replace the expat manager, leaving him free to take on similar assignments for the company. If things don't work out well, you will certainly be richer from the experience that you gained. <BR>&nbsp; If you have made a good enough impression you could -- if you wanted -- get drafted into Lexicon's overseas operations! Either way, it is a win-win move for you. Wishing you all the best.</P></TD></TR>

<P>SUKUMAR Sharma is indeed in an unenviable situation. On the one hand he faces an apparently recalcitrant market that refuses to be stirred by the known mantras of management; on the other, he has to tackle a conservative hard-nosed board that is looking for clear and unambiguous signals before it commits further resources to its Indian operations.</P></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;Compounding the problem is the fact that the board is not Indian and the products are at the premium end of the consumer goods segment that has stumped many a recent entrant to the Indian market.<BR>&nbsp; Sweets are an inseparable part of the Indian palate. But non-traditional products have a difficult task endearing themselves to the Indian sweet tooth. Product improvisations -- changes in product characteristics or usage patterns -- which demand a large resource commitment will most probably be required. Merely introducing an existing international product may not be the best way of persuading Indian customers in B-class towns to adopt a new product. <BR>&nbsp; A firm that wants to make an entry into this business will have to make investments in setting up a complete supply chain that will probably equal those made in manufacturing. Investments in maintaining and servicing a distribution network will have to be complemented by investments in brand building. In this context, it is therefore quite logical for Lexicon to have entered the Indian market through a joint venture with an existing business in this area. This strategy reduces investments in both -- the manufacturing as well as creating a distribution channel. This strategy would have enabled Lexicon India to devote its resources to brand-building and promotion. 
<P><A target="_parent" class=punch>Entering the low-end market will lead to a price war in this segment. It won't be sustainable unless the premium products are established.</A></P>
<P>&nbsp; The entry into the Indian market was prompted by the apparent size of the Indian middle class. The choice of a JV to enter India indicates a cautious, arm's-length commitment. There seems to be no evidence that the setting up of the Indian operation has been, in any way, integrated with the global operations of Lexicon. The Indian operation appears to have been set up only with an eye on the Indian market. Therefore, when Carey talks of exiting the Indian market, it is not a hollow threat but a logical follow-through of the parent company's investment/divestment strategies. The decision to continue operations in India does not appear to be irreversible. </P></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="60%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; I do not expect Sukumar's argument that more products from the Lexicon stable should be introduced in India to cut much ice. Premium confectioneries command high margins primarily owing to their market image, assiduously built up over years of consistent advertising. Lexicon, highly conscious of its image, will be reluctant to take on the Cadburys and Nestles in the low-end markets. Doing so would probably lead to a price war in the low-end segments which will not be sustainable unless the premium products are securely established. Even if it is successful in securing a satisfactory marketshare, Lexicon's brand image in India vis-a-vis its brand image at home will take a beating. This can harm Lexicon's premium products in India as well as other newer markets that it may wish to enter later. Exploiting economies of scale by entering the low-end markets after its premium products are established is one thing and entering the low-end segments to survive is yet another.&nbsp; </TD>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="40%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\19.GIF"> </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>Given its position internationally, I suspect that Lexicon's viability significantly depends on the sales revenues from its premium products.&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; Five years ago Lexicon had two options: enter India on its own or through a JV. Not perceiving any strategic advantage in Indian operations, this arm's-length involvement in the Indian market seemed to be the best option. Today, after the failure of the JV, Lexicon faces two options: consolidate its presence in the Indian market by building a plant or exit. The choice will essentially depend on its estimate of hitting a good market. The delay in setting up a plant and the imminent change in the top management are clear indications that the company is not ready with adequate credible information to make this decision. The "magic volume number" given by the parent company is its threshold level required to commit itself to consolidating the Indian operation. Having waited for a couple of years to see this figure emerge, they now seek a "second opinion" from their soon-to-be-appointed expat CEO. <BR>&nbsp; Whether they are at fault or not, Sukumar and his team today lack adequate credibility with the top management. If one takes the view that Lexicon is waiting for more adequate and reliable data to commit itself, it would be in the best interest of Lexicon (India) to enable the parent company to get this information. Resisting the appointment of an expat CEO on the ground that it would be too expensive will not help matters. <BR>&nbsp; Lexicon has been maintaining its operations in India despite losses for the past few years. Spending a couple of crores of rupees more will probably hasten its data acquisition process. Sukumar must use this as an Opportunity, of having a clear line of communication with the top management, to convince Lexicon about the veracity of his arguments. <BR>&nbsp; Lexicon cannot be accused of not having a vision; at best it may be faulted for being painfully cautious. But seeing the scenario in southeast Asia, this cautiousness may be justified. </TD></TR>

<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Benchmark Advertising Ltd, a growing agency where she was a senior manager, had been in the news ever since its premises were raided by the income tax authorities. For Mini it was a nightmare. Eight months ago, she had offered Benchmark the use of her spare flat in Bandra to accommodate the Mumbai regional manager, Ankush Mallar, whose house was under repair. It was a friendly arrangement and the request itself had come from Debu Guha, the managing director.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="63%" colSpan=4>&nbsp; The IT raid was conducted simultaneously at Chemur Industries, a client of Benchmark's, at Benchmark's offices and at the Bandra flat where Mallar lived. Cash and documents worth Rs 16 lakh were found in the flat, which Mallar explained as having been paid by Chemur for a major event. Chemur's troubles with the tax officials dragged Benchmark to the front pages. The Benchmark management had no idea about the cash transaction, it said. But Mini was named in the investigations as a senior officer in whose flat the money was found. <BR>&nbsp; "It's all okay now," Mini said to her ailing father. It was six months since that episode took place, and she had spoken to her father almost every week to reassure him that she was fine. Three days later Mini's father passed away holding his daughter's hand.<BR>&nbsp; Mini returned to Mumbai with a feeling of guilt. Had her problems at Benchmark triggered off his stroke?</TD>
<TD width="37%"><IMG SRC="my project_images\22.GIF"></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;&nbsp; For weeks after that she kept a low profile, trying hard to sort out the feelings in her mind.<BR>&nbsp; Mini had joined Benchmark only eight years ago. Her tryst with advertising began four years before that when she met the 78-year-old Seshashayee Ratnam at a Christmas carnival in Goa. Ratnam ran a small but flourishing ad agency in Hyderabad. Mini had been recently married and without a job. "Take up a job," Ratnam advised. "This country needs good people, good hands," Ratnam had said. <BR>&nbsp; Mini returned to Hyderabad and joined Ratnam's agency. A year later her husband was transferred to Bangalore. Ratnam spoke to Rajan Kamat, who ran Caption in Bangalore. "She is a gem, you will soon find out," he said. Kamat hired Mini and watched over her career. Within two years Mini's husband was transferred to Mumbai, and she had to move there. Vilas Moitra, a senior group head at Caption, had left to join Benchmark's Mumbai office as senior vice-president. "Come along Mini," he said. "Let's teach these guys some advertising." <BR>&nbsp; Mini couldn't believe her luck. But Mumbai came as a shock for her. The regional head of Mumbai, Ravin Rai, began a cold war against Moitra, who had been brought in as his second in command. Reason: Rai believed that Moitra was a plant to spy on his activities. Naturally, Mini was caught in the crossfire as she was seen as being in Moitra's camp. <BR>&nbsp; Rai handed charge of collections to Mini -- a position she felt did not do justice to her skills. But Moitra reassured her. "You are new; they will take time to know you. Meanwhile, work hard. We are here to turn this place into another Caption, remember?" And that was the brief Moitra himself had received from Guha. Benchmark's business was a mess after four clients had pulled out, leaving behind debts of more than Rs 1 crore.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mini decided to take her role seriously, but the daily wrangles between the Rai and Moitra camps devastated her. She decided to call Ratnam. "Why did you introduce me to advertising?" she asked. "It's a hellhole." <BR>&nbsp; "Because it should not be so," said Ratnam. "That is why we need good people." That put back the spring in her feet. Mini worked harder than ever before, but the hard work unearthed some murky facts. Benchmark under Rai had been double-billing clients for jobs for which they had already paid! <BR>&nbsp; Armed with these facts, Mini met Moitra. Moitra was delighted. Within days an audit was instituted and Rai sacked for negligence. Guha then brought in Ankush Mallar from Bangalore to steer the Mumbai branch. Benchmark gained two new accounts under Mallar, but recovery was slow. Steering a cash-strapped agency was tough on Mallar, and the loss of four accounts had already taken its toll on the branch. <BR>&nbsp; It was in his third year that the raid occurred. Mini was devastated. An act in good faith had got her into a meaningless mess. Her husband was away on a posting to Daman and Mini deemed it fit not to tell him anything. Moitra and Guha stood by her during the trials, reassuring her and reinforcing the cause of Benchmark. Eventually, Mallar was asked to resign and Moitra took over. Mini was elevated to the post of senior manager. She now worked directly under Moitra.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="36%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\23.GIF"></TD>
<TD width="64%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; Mini's resilience during the raid and after won her the respect of the management. Moitra himself trusted her immensely and soon she was part of an informal strategy committee to turn around the fortunes of the Mumbai office. After the Mallar debacle, the branch lost two more accounts, and morale plunged. Fearing that this would impact the overall image of the agency, Guha gave Moitra a long leash. "Do all that you think is necessary to turn this place around," he said. <BR>&nbsp; Moitra now informally appointed Mini as the `caregiver' at Benchmark. "HR has its limitations," he said. "The agency business is more about people, more about the softer aspects of emotions management, for which I am not sure HR has the skills. What I would like you to do is stay in touch with people at all levels." Moitra's primary objective was to ensure that there was no further erosion of morale -- something that had threatened the survival of the Mumbai office.&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; And he had noticed that Mini had an ability to resolve people-related crises with ease.As for Mini, she looked up to Moitra as a guide and philosopher. She had watched him during the transition period when Rai was the regional head and later during the Mallar trial and seen the composure and resilience with which he had tided over what appeared to be an explosive situation. And if Moitra's mission was to save Benchmark, then it was Mini's mission too. She had seen the destruction caused by Rai and Mallar and its impact on the staff.<BR>&nbsp; She had also tried to cope with the fundamental difference in attitudes between the management staff and the non-management staff to these episodes. The senior managers had shrugged their shoulders after a brief state of surprise. "These things happen. Business is about sudden shocks and surprises. Nothing is forever." Then it was back to business as usual.<BR>&nbsp; But down the line there was pandemonium. For the first to be hit by the loss in business were the non-management staff. Surplus staff were retired, increments suspended for two years and no promotions were given. This led to a lot of resentment. <BR>&nbsp; Mini was determined to change this feeling. "As long as the non-graded staff believe that the managers are a privileged lot, there isn't going to be any unity in our efforts," she said to Aarti Nayyar, another account executive, who had been working closely with Mini on her clients. Aarti had expressed deep interest in Mini's efforts and offered to help with training in copywriting. "Why don't we offer a skills development workshop where staffers can opt to learn either copywriting or print management? Over time, you can even upgrade those who show promise," suggested Aarti.<BR>&nbsp; Mini then started a weekend skills enhancement course in accounting, computers, copywriting and photography, using in-house managers. The idea worked brilliantly and a number of staffers enrolled. Mini was delighted with the experiment, but one person stood in her way -- the head office accountant Ramakant Naik. "All these madcap experiments are a waste of money and I am not allowing even a paisa for them," he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp; Moitra pooh-poohed Naik and told Mini to carry on regardless. When at the end of three months Mini produced an expense statement for Rs 1,200, towards photocopying, stationery and tea, Moitra suggested the unexpected. "Charge it to one of our clients by raising an overheads voucher," he said. <BR>&nbsp; Mini crumbled. She had not expected this from Moitra. Unable to bear the dishonesty, however small, Mini destroyed the bills and bore the cost herself. More followed. A few months later, while waiting in Moitra's ante-room, she heard his secretary instruct the branch production accountant: "This bill from Mello is to be charged as photographic props, these repair bills for his farm house to be debited to 'office repairs'...." <BR>&nbsp; Mini could take it no more. Moitra, her hero, had feet of clay. She busied herself with her next client meeting. But she was bothered. Benchmark was slowly turning around, three new accounts had been signed in the last six months... was Moitra going to destroy all that, she wondered. <BR>&nbsp; The same month Mini discovered she had diabetes, and at a fairly advanced stage. "I am surprised you did not feel the symptoms sooner," said the doctor. But her ailment was far from her mind. She tried to visualise Moitra who even during his Caption days stood for integrity and hard work. What had happened to this simple man from a middle class family with ordinary preoccupations like a family and children? Was he chasing a glitzy life like all of them? 
<P><A target="_parent" class=punch>After the murky goings-on at benchmark claimed the heads of two successive bosses, Moitra appointed Mini as the "Caregiver" to ensure that there was no further erosion of morale.</A></P>
<P>&nbsp; Mini called Ratnam, just to hear his voice. If she had the courage, she would mention her anxieties, she decided. But Ratnam's opening sentence put paid to her plans. "I am glad you are working for none less than Moitra, such a stellar chap... I am delighted Benchmark is seeing better days under him." <BR>&nbsp; That week Mini got an offer from Amity, another agency, asking her to join it as group head. It was a good offer and Mini briefly considered taking it up. But Ratnam's words came back to her: "This industry deserves to have good people; that's the only way it will grow respectfully." <BR>&nbsp; Mini declined the offer. Benchmark needed her, she realised. Aarti, who had been made the same offer, accepted it and resigned from Benchmark. Mini felt lonelier than ever. It was that week that she got a call from Guha in Bangalore. "I am glad you did not accept Amity's offer," he said, much to Mini's surprise. "Benchmark cannot afford to lose people like you. Mini, Benchmark is a great agency even if it is going through bad times. There are few people I can trust here, Moitra and you are two of those. Together we will build Benchmark into the best agency in India." <BR>&nbsp; Mini had mixed feelings -- elation at what Guha, the MD, had said about his faith in her, pain at what he still believed about Moitra, and helplessness at her own inability to change Moitra's growing dishonesty. <BR>&nbsp; Around that time, Benchmark won a new food account -- Golden Gate Foods. The account enabled Benchmark to climb the chart by a few respectable rungs and the Mumbai office was finally out of the red. The account was to be handled by Surya Thomas, a group head. Thomas was highly regarded within Benchmark and had a number of successes to his credit. His group was full of beans and brimming with ideas. For long Mini had wanted to work with Thomas but Moitra had admonished her, saying: "We are already low on numbers, if I release you to Thomas who is going to handle your accounts?"<BR>&nbsp; But this time Mini spoke to Guha to pre-empt a refusal by Moitra. "This is one account I really want to work on," she explained to Guha. "Obviously with Moitra and Thomas being at war with each other, I can see the problem," said Guha. "Mr Guha, can't you help resolve their differences?" asked Mini. <BR>&nbsp; "Competition is always productive and destructive. Eventually the business benefits," said Guha with a laugh. Moitra agreed to Mini's request readily. But he said: "Thomas is not such a great genius, I must warn you. There is little he can teach and what he knows is not worth knowing." <BR>&nbsp; Over the next year the horror stories unfolded. Thomas was an old Rai camper and there was a slow but steady plan by Moitra to oust him. Moitra had delayed his promotion and written unsavoury things in his appraisal report.</P></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="63%" colSpan=4>The tug-of-war began. Despite having allowed her transfer to Thomas' group, Moitra disrupted her time by making irrational demands at crucial moments. That was when Mini confronted Moitra. "Why are you doing this?" she asked. "I have handed over my earlier accounts capably, now I have to devote myself to Golden Gate. I find your interruptions devious," she finally blurted out. <BR>&nbsp; What followed was explosive. Moitra blasted her for insubordination, irresponsibility and many more things. "I will not have you tell me how to run my agency. If there are urgent tasks to be attended to, I as regional head have the right to expect those done without your advice or counsel." <BR>&nbsp; The following day Thomas asked Mini to hand over the account to another manager. "Maybe at a later date when you have sorted out the problems on your old accounts, you can return to Golden Gate," he advised.</TD>
<TD width="37%"><IMG SRC="my project_images\24.GIF"></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Mini was already exhausted by the effects of the drugs she was taking for her diabetes. Thomas' decision made her feel worse and she took the rest of the week off to be by herself with an old aunt. It was while she was browsing at a bookstore that she happened to glance at a blurb on a magazine cover. `Different strokes' announced the blurb, `is a story by Aarti Nayyar which brings out the murky goings on in agency corridors, demystifying the glamour and gloss of the agency business...". <BR>&nbsp; Three hours later, in her aunt's verandah, Mini passed out. Aarti's story was all about her experiences with ad agencies and a number of anecdotes in her story were all about Moitra and his escapades, although the entire story was fictionalised. <BR>&nbsp; Mini woke up in Dr Sharma's nursing home in distant Alibag. Even though the doctor warned her that her blood sugar had dropped significantly and advised her a week's rest, Mini convinced her aunt and returned to Mumbai and work. <BR>&nbsp; But it was an angry Moitra she met. Handing a copy of the magazine to her, he said: "Would you like to read this? After all, you have cut short your leave, you might like to relax with a magazine at work." The sarcasm was not lost on Mini. "That was the reason I returned so soon," said Mini pointing to the magazine. "It was unbearable, especially since she worked so closely with us for over three years." <BR>&nbsp; "At least it is clear who fed her with the information," said Moitra. Mini wasn't sure she understood. "Who?" she asked. "Don't pretend innocence, Mini," said Moitra seriously. "Aarti worked closely with you. Besides, since the time she left your behaviour has been hostile..." &nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; Still weak after the recent blackout, Mini felt exhausted. But responding to Moitra's allegations seemed to be the most important thing now. "Vilas, this is a serious allegation you are making and it disturbs me very much. Please remember, we both began our careers at Benchmark with a pledge to nurse it back to health. I don't know about you, but I still have the same fervor and dedication. Before we go on a witch-hunt for Aarti's informer, it's important that we resolve our differences, or better still, talk about our goals and Benchmark." 
<P><A target="_parent" class=punch>When a magazine article on the corrupt practices at Benchmark came out, Mini had a long ltalk with Moitra, but he didn't admit his failings and accused Mini of leaking the information.</A></P>
<P>&nbsp; They talked. About his bills, his tampering with production charges to clients, Thomas, Golden Gate... "I know I do not have the ability to be 100% honest. Running a business, specially one that challenges your career, is not easy. My marriage has been troubled for over a year, this story is not going to make it easy. Yes, Thomas threatens my peace. There are rumours that he will replace me..." <BR>&nbsp; Mini heard him out patiently. But nowhere was she hearing in Moitra's voice any sign of regret. At every stage he was justifying what he had done. But at least the misunderstandings were now out in the open... Then he asked: "Tell me Mini, how much did you tell Aarti?" <BR>&nbsp; Mini was taken aback. All that talking had not restored his faith in her integrity. "Not a word, Vilas," she said. Mini could see that Moitra did not believe her. As if in confirmation, he said: "Mini, I am not sure I trust you." &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp; That night Mini sat in her room watching TV, aimlessly surfing channels. Towards midnight, she decided she would chat with her husband in Daman. It would take her mind off the problems at work, she thought. As she reached out for the phone, there was an agonising pain in her chest. A gasp left her lips as she pressed the buzzer which rang in her maid's room. <BR>&nbsp; Mini had suffered a massive cardiac arrest. Her sugar level had dropped to an all-time low. The doctors worked on her frantically and managed to revive her. Her husband arrived the next noon, which speeded her recovery. Mini had four blocked arteries, said the doctors. They would have to wait for her sugar level to return to normal before they performed bypass surgery, they said. The hospital psychologist met Mini. "You have been working too hard," he said gently. "Hardly," said Mini. "But I have been neglecting my diabetes." <BR>&nbsp; "That is evident," he said. "But what happened? Haven't you been taking your insulin regularly?" he asked. <BR>&nbsp; "It's her diet," said her husband. "The maid tells me she rarely eats a proper dinner. It's either a piece of cake and coffee or rasgollas and tea. Where does her sugar level stand a chance?" <BR>The maid in turn blamed it on overwork. Guha flew down from Bangalore and threw in his bit: "Ever since she lost her father, she has been very different," he offered. Moitra had the last word. "She is very sensitive. She absorbs the problems of the people around her." Mini shut her eyes; she could not bear this dishonesty any more, she felt.</P></TD></TR>

<P>&nbsp; LIVE as if you will die tomorrow, but plan to live forever." It is a useful maxim because our responses to situations change over time. Work is not what it used to be inside or outside organisations. The paradox of time, combined with the changing nature of work, forces us to rethink our whole idea of work and time -- when we work, where we work, how we work and why we work.<BR>&nbsp; What Mini has been through typifies the experience of many professionals. All organisations have Guhas, Rais and Moitras in some measure -- some more and some less. It is not uncommon to witness power plays and politics in an organisation manifesting themselves in several ways as in the case of Benchmark.</P></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>In the prevailing business environment, while organisations are experiencing discontinuity and uncertainty on the one hand, professionals are coping with heightened aspirations and growing insecurities on the other. This is leading to enhanced and sustained stress levels. Benchmark and Mini are no exception. <BR>&nbsp; All of us, along with the demands of the various roles that we play, need to focus on many more fundamental issues of life like: What are my aspirations for both my personal and professional life? Why do I work? How do I deal with emotions, both in personal and professional life? What is my responsibility towards myself? What are the values I want to live by? 
<P><A target="_parent" class=punch>We need to be able to strike a balance between our professional and personal lives without allowing either to impact the other.</A></P>
<P>&nbsp; A clear vision for ourselves is what Mini and most of us miss out on. Mini's vision for herself and her life seemed to be limited to Benchmark Advertising. She seemed to be reacting to whatever was urgent at work based on the impulse of the moment, her feelings or moods. Thus, she operated from a limited awareness of other options and responsibilities that she might have. In effect, her vision was partial and the choices she made led to the imbalance. Her vision was based on the choices and expectations of others. This, in turn, led to Mini disconnecting from her inner self and finding herself at odds with herself. <BR>&nbsp; Each one of us needs to step aside from our lives and evaluate the course that we are taking. Getting into activities is a very comfortable state of existence. But reviewing whether these activities fall in the overall pattern and expectations from one's life is what will ultimately determine happiness and fulfillment. Mini moves from Hyderabad to Bangalore to Mumbai, changes agencies, does not go to Daman, takes it upon herself to change Benchmark single-handedly without focusing on "what do I want to do and why?" Such high involvement in activities without an aim is bound to lead to stress. <BR>&nbsp; We rarely experience intense feeling. And for most of us, our feelings fall into the grey zone, with mild bumps in our emotional roller-coaster.</P></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="63%" colSpan=4>&nbsp; Managing our emotions is a full-time job. Much of what we do -- especially in our leisure time -- is in fact an attempt to manage our feelings and emotions. The art of taking care of and nurturing ourselves is a fundamental life skill and is one of the most essential ones. Each one of us is actually left to invent our own devices to not only vanquish bad moods but also to balance our emotions. Life has its ups and downs, but they need to be balanced. Like Mini, each one of us needs to develop coping mechanisms for dealing with intense emotions. <BR>&nbsp; Life has many facets: a profession is just one of them. All of us need to have worthy goals in life, both personal and professional. Success in life encompasses not only professional excellence but also sound health, high energy and zeal for life, satisfying relationships with people, creatively crafting a future life path, emotional stability, happiness and, above all, peace of mind.</TD>
<TD width="37%"><IMG SRC="my project_images\26.GIF"></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; We need to be able to strike a balance between our professional and personal lives without allowing either to impact the other. Mini seemed to be unable to give herself a focus. She actually made her personal and work lives fuzzy and procrastinated in taking decisions in both these areas, which worked to her disadvantage. It is, therefore, important to continuously hone our ability to consciously delink ourselves from professional worries and avoid carrying them into our personal life. These two lives are somewhat mutually exclusive and our ability to effectively manage this aspect will help strike an appropriate balance in our lives. <BR>&nbsp; Another important emerging issue is: how does an employee deal with a corrupt superior? One could be courageous enough to report the boss to his superior or confront the boss and deal with the outcome or response in a mature manner. One could even deflect such issues and stay focused on the task on hand. Not being able to manage/deal with any of the above would result in severe stress to the individual, leaving him/her wondering as to why he/she is still with the organisation. Mini, even after confronting Moitra, found herself in this situation. Many of us do not help ourselves in understanding our own values about discipline, time boundaries, the kind of work we want to do, ethics etc. The courage of conviction to stand up for and deal with situations/issues leading to harmonising with our inner self is indeed important. <BR>&nbsp; We need a new way of thinking about our problems and our future. If the contradictions and surprises of paradox are going to be part of that future, we should not be dismayed. The acceptance of paradox as a feature of our life is the first step towards living with it and managing it. <BR>&nbsp; Earlier, one thought that paradoxes were the visible signs of an imperfect world. Paradox has to be accepted, coped with and made sense of, in life, in work and the society we live in.</TD></TR>

I do not even know where to begin. Everything is bad. <BR>&nbsp; AB: What makes it stressful today? <BR>&nbsp; Mini: Oh! I feel there is so much conflict. I cannot take it anymore. <BR>&nbsp; AB: Do you want to talk about the conflict you faced today?</P></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Mini: Well! There is this person Moitra. I have known him for more than eight years now. We were good friends. He suddenly turns around and tells me that he doesn't trust me anymore. It makes me feel so bad. To think that I moved with him to this company I work for! He said we would change the world, I was almost a partner in whatever he did. It is so painful! <BR>&nbsp; AB: So, you feel upset that Moitra doesn't trust you anymore. It must make you feel bad. Has your opinion of Moitra changed in the last eight years?<BR>&nbsp; Mini: Oh, absolutely. He was such a nice guy, you know, middle-class, never one to run after glitzy things, zealously committed to what he was doing. He was a good man. But now, he is what I would call a bad egg. You know there is this person Aarti who has even written a story about his exploits. <BR>&nbsp; AB: How does Aarti know him? <BR>&nbsp; Mini: She used to work with us for a few years. AB: Do you agree with what Aarti has written about him? <BR>&nbsp; Mini: There is no doubt about it. Aarti is an honest person. In fact, that is the problem. Moitra thinks I told Aarti all that she wrote. How can he think like that of me? I would never do such a thing. <BR>&nbsp; AB: If what Aarti is saying is true and you have known Moitra so well for so long, did you not see what was happening? <BR>&nbsp; Mini: That is the problem. I saw it happening and I did not see it happening. If I look back he always was up to something. But I believed in him so blindly that I could not see anything. I was sure he would help the company change.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="63%" colSpan=4>&nbsp; AB: So, he seemed so good at that time that it was difficult to focus on the wrong things that he did.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; Mini: Yes. <BR>&nbsp; AB: And he is so bad now that it is difficult to focus on anything right he may be doing. <BR>&nbsp; Mini: Yes. <BR>&nbsp; AB: What you seem to be saying is that though you do not trust him anymore he should continue to trust you? He owes you that degree of trust. <BR>&nbsp; Mini: He has no right to mistrust me, it hurts me so much. <BR>&nbsp; AB: It seems to be an important feeling for you that everyone should trust you, whatever you think of them. If everyone did not trust you, would you believe that you are not a good person. <BR>&nbsp; Mini: Maybe. IT WAS not advertising, not the mistrusting Moitra, the entrusting Guha, the value-strapped and cash-strapped Benchmark that caused her to have a heart attack. It was perhaps her thoughts.</TD>
<TD width="37%"><IMG SRC="my project_images\28.GIF"></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Mini is an intelligent person who knows how to care for people. She seems to be diligent, meticulous and honest in her work. Then what makes her neglectful, sloppy and uncaring when she deals with her illness? Her personality traits should actually lead for her to be extremely cautious about herself -- unless she has a stronger need that is met by not looking after herself. <BR>&nbsp; What is that need? Let me highlight some ways of thinking that Mini demonstrates that made life stressful for her. These ways of thinking contributed to her heart attack. <BR>&nbsp; There are assumptions that Mini seemed to be working on the basis of. <BR>&nbsp; All people have to be approving of her all the time. Whatever the cost. Moitra has to like her. Guha has to like her, the man whose increments got stopped has to like her. Such an addiction for approval makes one strive for unrealistic self-neglecting altruism. 
<P><A target="_parent" class=punch>Mini, unlike many others, believed that the organisation came first. But how she coped with this assumption was stressful to her.</A></P>
<P>&nbsp; Mini, unlike many others at Benchmark, believed that the organisation comes first. Rightly so, perhaps. But how she coped with this assumption was stressful for her. Whenever she saw people not adhering to this principle she felt hurt and worked harder to bring in the euphemistic warmth of Caption to this organisation. <BR>&nbsp; Her hurt and anger at people who did not care for the organisation became a starting point for a messianic mission. Each Rai, Mallar or Moitra incident made her personalise the fight for the organisation. Such personal battles without looking at systemic changes are like pushing a wall. They create only clogged arteries, not changes in organisation. <BR>&nbsp; She did not look after herself, for she wanted the organisation to look after her. She wanted the company to understand her needs and take care of her because she had taken care of the organisation. Organisations are unfortunately unfair. They view matters with a broad brush. They overlook potential crises. Benchmark was adept at overlooking potential crises; that it missed the fact that Mini was carrying the load of the organisation's conscience was to be expected. An organisation that does not put in place systems to build values even when two consecutive heads have had to go because of integrity issues must be a sleepy organisation. It is unsafe then for people like Mini who make their work their life goal. There is more to life than the organisation you work for and there is more to an organisation than a personal battle to bring about change.</P></TD></TR>

<TD width="99%" colSpan=4><A target="_parent" class=punch>Liberalisation posed a dilemma for Remee India. Should it take on the multinationals in the cosmetics market? Or should it be a distributor for the multinationals?</A></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="99%" colSpan=4>&nbsp; DINESH Vira arranged the jars of Remee lotions and creams on the top of the semi-circular shelf, keeping Besille's products on the second and Cover on the third. Stepping back, he eyed the display proudly.&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Only two years ago, this showcase in his outer office had looked sparse and empty. In fact, the tea boy used the last shelf to keep used teacups which he collected on his way out.&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; Today the three large shelves were bursting with jars and bottles of varied skin and hair care products. In short, Remee India, where Dinesh was the marketing director, was back in the reckoning.<BR>&nbsp; Three years ago, Manu Pal, the chairman &amp; managing director of Remee India and group chairman of MP Industries, whose businesses included paper, oil, pharmaceuticals, agro-chemicals and skin care products, announced the sale of the pharmaceutical and agro-chemicals businesses. The decision came after months of debate with his board members who concluded that MP Industries should streamline its business focus. Remee India, which held the dental, agro-chemicals and skin care businesses, was a Rs 30 crore company.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The skin care business, which showed no signs of growing, seemed to be next on the firing line. In the pre-liberalisation days, Remee's skin care business coasted along, happy with its small product base and protected markets. The company did not do anything dramatic to grow nor was competition too tough. There were Pond's, Lakme, Charmis, Nivea and some herbal products in the market. All of them had similar portfolios, and there were hardly anything to differentiate the brands. <BR>&nbsp; Remee's skin care business included a talcum powder, a skin care cream, a shaving cream and a heel crack healer. But over 60% of its sales was accounted for by Remee cream, a multipurpose, all-weather cream. That was dangerous, because, despite being an all-purpose cream, most of Remee's sales took place only during three months of the year, in winter. "</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="66%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; Remee had launched summer products like deodorants and freshness soaps only recently and tentatively. During the lean summer months, the company lost touch with its consumers. Yet when winter came, consumers queued up at the shops for Remee. In a good winter, sales targets were met. But if it was a humid winter when nobody needed heavy moisturising creams, stocks began to pile up. During those lean times, its pharma range of colds and flu prescriptions kept Remee busy. <BR>&nbsp; The skin care business required a turnover of at least Rs 100 crore to be viable in the new market -- a far cry from Remee's Rs 17 crore. It was not a viable size by any stretch of the imagination. Even reaching the Rs 100 crore mark was unimaginable. When liberalisation opened the floodgates, Lever bought Lakme and merged sister concern Pond's, creating a mammoth skin care conglomerate, with a presence in every segment and a distribution clout that was terrifying.&nbsp;</TD>
<TD width="34%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\31.GIF"></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; The rules of the game changed for ever, putting a question mark on the survival of Remee's skin care business.<BR>&nbsp;Dinesh and his sales &amp; marketing vice-president Raghu Iyer knew it was a matter of time before Manu closed down Remee skin care. While Dinesh prayed silently for a miracle, Raghu kept his cool. Said Raghu: "I know many companies are hiving off non-core businesses. Our skin care business, even if not core, is certainly the business of the future. No doubt it is small, but just look at the opportunities. We have been in this business for over 30 years. We have already covered the learning hub to some extent. Then there is our distribution set-up, which is a gold mine. Today distribution determines success. When there is so much in the bag, why don't we try grow this business seriously for a year? After all, new players are entering this field... We can make this work." <BR>&nbsp; Dinesh heard him out keenly. Theoretically, liberalisation offered new opportunities which were not available earlier like the freedom to import raw materials or even finished goods, to tie up with a foreign player for technology or marketing skills, or for leveraging distribution strengths. "We could, in fact, become a distribution company, take on the brands of large companies and sell and distribute them," he thought. <BR>&nbsp; Dinesh, for all his enthusiasm, was not sure if they had what it took for success. But Raghu egged him on. They had to put the past behind them, he said, for the future beckoned and Raghu did not want to give up yet. <BR>&nbsp; "There was no compelling need then to prove one's might," he reasoned with Dinesh. "In those days of protectionism, one could go on for years doing barely anything at all. Then again, when were the skin care companies so savvy in India? For years we coasted along with cold creams."<BR>&nbsp; Remee could capitalise on its strong distribution network, but at no time in the past was it challenged. "The people and markets were always there, even the demand we can say was there, if latent, but we did not push our distributive strengths to its limits. But today, just look at what our competitors are doing. Lever has capitalised on its distribution strength," said Raghu. <BR>&nbsp; Dinesh shook his head. "It won't work Raghu. What are we trying to do? Put in the money only to have them wipe us out?" 
<P><A target="_parent" class=punch>In the pre-liberalisation days, Remee's skin care business coasted along, happy with its small product base, protected markets and little advertising. It did not do anything dramatic to grow.</A></P>
<P>At the next stage, I would look for answers to the following key issues: In this highly competitive skin care industry, what is the 'niche' that Remee India can dominate? How fast and how soon would Remee India be able to enter this segment? What innovative and unique business processes can be created to be a successful player in this chosen 'niche'? This analysis is critical because business is all about focus -- it is very easy to get into several areas, trying to be everything to everybody. But you can end up being nothing to anybody.<BR>&nbsp; Several companies followed this focused approach and came up with success stories. One that comes readily to my mind is Velvette shampoo. In a market dominated by the likes of Lever and Procter &amp; Gamble, Velvette became a formidable brand in a very short time (obviously capitalising on the excise laws at that time) by choosing the sachet route. Velvette was one of the first to sell shampoo in sachets, rewriting the rules to become a significant player. Had it taken Lever head-on in the bottle segment for shampoos, it would probably have had no success.</P>
<P>&nbsp; Even so, Dinesh met Manu and put forth his case. "There is a future if you believe there is one," Dinesh told Manu. "I believe Indian companies can survive liberalisation provided they believe there is a future for them. It just requires vision and optimism. We only need to be persistent, innovative, creatively dynamic... Leave no stone unturned." <BR>&nbsp; But Manu was wary. "Dinesh, you are suggesting that I put in more money so that you can experiment with your ideology," said Manu. "That's unfair Manu, there is my career too," said Dinesh. "Besides, when so many new entrants are coming in, wouldn't it be easier for me to thank you for the wonderful times and move on to an American or French major and mint my millions? I can go there and peddle this very mind and intelligence to strategise for them, build their millions and their brands. Why can't I use that very intelligence here?" <BR>&nbsp; Manu was cynical about the opportunities that liberalisation offered. Yet he didn't want to discourage Dinesh. "All right," said Manu finally. "But if I don't see results in a year, I go ahead with my plan," he said. Then he asked: "What is your plan?" <BR>&nbsp; Dinesh felt Remee needed to bring in far more round-the-year products; products that were relevant and which had a mass base. Then again, he said, Remee alone could not drive growth. To survive in the fast changing market, the company needed to grow quickly and hence required more products. "Therefore, we need to launch shampoos, after-shave products, hand washes, face washes, maybe a good Remee soap which uses the Remee cream base..." <BR>&nbsp; The soap idea interested Manu. Why not, he asked himself. Soap was the biggest skin care tool in India, and if he was saying that Remee was in the business of skin care how could he not be in soap? Even so, the prospect of entering the soap market worried him. <BR>&nbsp; But Dinesh was upbeat. "The soap idea is good," he said confidently. "We can use Remee soap to reach out to a much wider audience, bring it into the Remee fold and slowly graduate from there. We can get into body lotions, which is an area that is just beginning to grow; it's the right time to enter it, and it is a round-the-year product. We need new products, more competitive pricing and more of a mass reach." <BR>&nbsp; Over the next few days Dinesh decided to redefine Remee's business. Along with Raghu, he looked at the distribution network Remee had built, and agreed that it was sheer neglect that had weakened the system. Today when new companies were desperately seeking ready-to-use distribution networks, Remee was sitting on a gold mine.</P></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="29%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\32.GIF"></TD>
<TD width="71%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; Dinesh then got on to the serious task of strengthening the sales and distribution teams. To the sales team he said: "We have stopped thinking differently, daringly, innovatively. We need to have the guts to try out the craziest of ideas in the marketplace. It's the only way for a small outfit with little money, like us, to grab the consumer's attention." <BR>&nbsp; The next few months were hectic for Dinesh and his team. The timing was unusually right. Summer was six months away and if they could get the products out by February, they would catch the market at the beginning of tbut he season, he reckoned.<BR>&nbsp; Simultaneously, he set to work on Remee's image. Dinesh spent long hours brainstorming with Raghu. Two things emerged from the discussions: one, Remee had to become more visible in the marketplace.&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; "Everybody knows the brand, but nobody remembers it," said Dinesh, "and somehow that knowledge does not seem enough to translate into purchases."<BR>&nbsp; Raghu agreed. "Most of the time, people don't remember it. If they do, the chances of their buying it will be high," he said. The brand enjoyed a lot of goodwill and that was a card they had to play. "It's a brand that won't let you down," said Raghu, not realising he had gone on to create the stunning new ad line for Remee. For that summed up the brand's image in the market. The whole platform on which Remee stood was nurturing care, and that is what they all now realised. So now the entire focus of their strategy was to make Remee visible. Dinesh and Raghu decided to test the idea at Goodsland, a supermarket in the suburbs. They installed a dramatic boot-shaped trolley using the Remee colours, layered with shelves and decorated with purple and white festoons and filled it with Remee products of every size and packing. Goodsland, which had for years given them sales of Rs 9,000 a month, now gave them an eye-popping Rs 2 lakh! Manu was astounded. "What did you do?" he asked Dinesh. "Just reminded the consumer that Old Faithful is still there," said Dinesh. The storekeeper agreed. "I have been running this supermarket for nine years and I have watched the performance of so many brands here. Even the new brands that came in didn't attract so much interest. This boat full of Remee somehow touched the consumers' hearts." By the following month, Dinesh and Raghu acquired strategic spots in over 5,000 outlets, decked up the shelves with ribbons and dew-drops, increased the point-of-purchase display and the advertising.<BR>&nbsp; The winter of 1997 saw hectic activity at Remee, with preparations on for the launch of a soap in the coming summer. That was when Dinesh got a call from a friend in Delaware's joint venture, Progg. "Have you sensed any drop in market movements? We are feeling a dramatic slowing down..!" 
<P><A target="_parent" class=punch>Even though Remee's tieups for distribution products of other companies had worked well, this strategy had its pitfalls. What would it do if its partners decided to set up their own outfits?</A></P>
<P>&nbsp; But Dinesh had not felt anything. Even so, he took note. After all, Delaware was a huge company and was therefore more likely to be correct in predicting or sensing market pulse changes. "This winter has been very humid," said the friend, "so moisturising creams and lotions are not selling well. The No. 2 in the market, Dewy, has lost almost 50% of its share in this one season!"<BR>&nbsp; In such a season, Remee, which was a distant No. 6, had actually turned around and moved way up the charts! Dinesh didn't know what to make of this trend. "Clearly, Remee has a consumer value which is unaffected by seasonal distortions," said Manu. Dinesh didn't let himself get carried away by this performance. As he said to Raghu: "Let us not get overoptimistic. None of us has clear reasons for this behaviour. If we believe a maverick market, we will be digging our grave." <BR>&nbsp; But Dinesh had mixed feelings. On the one hand, he needed the optimism and would have loved to believe that Remee was coming alive. That was the sort of news he needed to reassure Manu that the skin care business could survive. Yet, one stupid mistake and the shutters would be drawn on the division. <BR>&nbsp; Remee's marketshare did not grow, but neither did it lose marketshare in a scenario that was destroying the bigger players. Dinesh now prepared to build a strong position in the skin care market. As long as Remee remained outside the C class markets, there wasn't much scope for building volumes. But going into the C class market required a product suited to the category, and the recession didn't encourage such moves. To complicate matters, Manu received an offer for a buyout from a consumer products major. Dinesh naturally cringed. Recent events in the industry provided no encouragement to stay on, unless he hung on to the idea that Remee had survived the bad winter... Surprisingly, Manu put the offer on hold, preferring to wait the one year he had promised Dinesh. But the doomsayers were aplenty. "The next millennium is for those who cross the Rs 100 crore mark. You don't stand a chance, sell out while the offers are still coming," they said. The summer of 1998 saw the launch of Remee soap, which was successful, much to everyone's surprise. But Dinesh knew that the soap was not enough. Remee's creams and lotions too had to perk up, for their survival determined the soap's future. The synergy would help both product groups, he realised. <BR>&nbsp; Even as sales picked up, Dinesh thought: "Just Remee is not going to be enough. Neither can we keep doing this `visibility' act for too long. We need to do something else to sustain the memory. Besides, the fate of the division cannot hang on one brand. Since we have this very driven distribution network, we need to bring in more products of the same quality, going to the same outlets, which have some synergy. We must use the existing infrastructure to service a far better throughput." <BR>&nbsp; Dinesh looked at the horizon keenly for new products. In six weeks he had examined 12 products, but none was inspiring. That was when he came across Besille, a hair care company that was looking for a distribution tieup in India. The product category suited Dinesh, who did not want any product that was in conflict with Remee's range. Besides, hair care also gave him the width of range he needed. <BR>&nbsp; Dinesh realised how much liberalisation had benefited them. "Today we can import just about anything and put it into national distribution in as short a time as six weeks! And we're offering terrific reach as well, if you consider the networks we have developed."</P></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="66%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; Remee was one of the companies that the market had written off in the wake of liberalisation. It fell in the category of companies that appeared big, strong and active, and had one or two products that stayed on shop shelves simply because there was space. These companies just stayed where they were, the people stayed where they were; new people joined, but the older ones didn't go. They had high costs and low revenues. But they also had manufacturing facilities, selling strengths and product management teams. They were sitting ducks for takeovers, which is what the market predicted for Remee too. <BR>&nbsp; Now Dinesh had reason to feel hopeful. Remee had gained visibility and had survived one very bad winter. Sales had increased, but he still had the task of pushing the Remee brand to a younger segment and to year-round usage.&nbsp;</TD>
<TD width="34%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\33.GIF"></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; But that needed money, and whatever they had was used to deliver extra mileage through the new innovative marketing ploys."<BR>&nbsp; Over the next six months, Besille's success at Remee India triggered off a chain of new business opportunities from various prospective new entrants seeking distribution tieups. One such was Cover, a foot care and treatment range of sloughing grains, corn treatment, rough skin vitaliser and nail toner. It suited Remee. It did not compete with its other ranges and was a product which went through the channels that Remee was servicing, through the normal route it had. Remee wouldn't have to make any additional investment. <BR>&nbsp; The overall gameplan had worked so far. Remee had survived and gained visibility. It had increased its range with a soap and a lotion. Besille and Cover had come at the right time to leverage on its distribution strengths.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But at the end of the day it was just trading, felt Raghu. "How long can we sustain it? I feel if the ownership is not there, the stakes will be low and our interest may wane. Don't forget, even if we are great joint venture partners, we can't be sure about our partners and what demands they might make. Once they get a foothold in India, they may set up 100% subsidiaries and terminate the contract. What then?"<BR>&nbsp; Dinesh now wondered whether he was making a short-term decision just to stay afloat. "As a business opportunity it may be interesting and useful for starters," he said to Manu. "But we will always be vulnerable as partners." <BR>&nbsp; The question that plagued both Manu and Dinesh was: how viable was this gameplan? What other strengths did they need to develop? What, if any, pitfalls were they overlooking? How should they leverage this distribution strength? Could they continue being a mere trading company for all these brands? No doubt they manufactured Remee, but how successful was it going to be when `only distribution' businesses did not allow them brand ownership? <BR>&nbsp; Where does Remee go from here? Dinesh was happy that their gamble had paid off. Remee was today soaring high with a turnover that had more than trebled. But change was so endemic to corporate life these days that he was not willing to rest on his laurels. No doubt he had a couple of winning formulae to change the direction of growth at Remee. These formulae would see him over the hub of failure in the short term, but he needed to innovate and introspect every day so that Remee would keep pace with the changes in the marketplace. <BR>&nbsp; Today distribution was Remee's perceived advantage. But Dinesh needed to evolve a system for continuously inventing new advantages. As he said to Raghu: "I can't really call all this `strategy'. It is at best an operational optimisation effort. We have put together a gameplan that helps us do profitable things with our distribution resources. But what we need to do is examine what else we are capable of within the dimensions of our learning and then examine what new resources and learning we need to acquire. In short, this survival is to be seen as merely an event in our lives. Do we know where we go from here?</TD></TR>

<P>TO PARAPHRASE Charlie Brown, Dinesh must feel that happiness is not knowing what to do next. As the marketing director of Remee India's personal products business, Dinesh Vira has a stable containing a range of products for skin care, hair care and even foot care. Indeed, a showcase in his outer office which looked sparse and empty just two years ago is now full; full with three different ranges of products in three different categories. Looks like good work, well done.&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; However, a close look at the business seems to show that all is not well. Remee is still a skin care category business, very much in the basic skin care business, marketing talcum powder and a multi-purpose, all-weather cream and some other minor products.</P></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; New launches, such as deodorants and freshness soap, haven't really been successful; at best (to quote the case) a tentative success. <BR>&nbsp; On the other hand, Remee has certainly met success as a distributor for a range of imported products such as Besille hair care and Cover foot care products. Both imported brands have done well in the market, and though the case does not really amplify Remee's role, I am pretty sure that Remee provided more than just distribution. <BR>&nbsp; But the main question continues to be what should Remee do in the future. In the post-liberalisation world, being a distribution house is certainly not enough; indeed, all the distribution houses in India -- Voltas, TTK, Muellar and Phipps and all the others have long disappeared. <BR>&nbsp; In addition, building foreign brands in India carries with it the risk that the owners of the brandname can -- indeed most certainly will -- build their own business once the brand is well established in the country. As Dinesh has correctly concluded, making a series of short-term decisions, just to stay afloat, does not necessarily result in a long-term business vision. 
<P><A target="_parent" class=punch>In the post-liberalisation world, being a distribution company is not enough; Indeed, all the distribution houses in India have disappeared.</A></P>
<P>&nbsp; Recently I have been speaking to some young brand managers from the area of understanding consumer behaviour as being an essential prerequisite in developing marketing strategies. In that context, I found this quotation from Alice in Wonderland most appropriate; indeed, it is so even in the context of this case study: <BR>&nbsp; "Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?" asked Alice.&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp; "That depends a good deal on where you want to get to," said the Cat. <BR>&nbsp; The key question that has to be answered by Manu Pal is whether the skin care business is a business in which Remee India and MP Industries are interested. If they are interested in the business, they require a lot more than being a good distribution house and have a small set of nondescript, rather old-fashioned brands.<BR>&nbsp; Indeed, the need is to develop a skin care culture within the business and understand the market, major competitors, consumers and the overall environment in which the market is operating. Unless this is done, Remee India's skin care business has no future. <BR>&nbsp; Take the example of Pond's in India during the pre-liberalisation years. Around 80% of its profits came from its export business, which accounted for just 20% of its turnover.</P></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="66%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; Though a market leader in some segments of the skin care market, such as talcum powder and basic skin creams, its record in new product development, was, to put it bluntly, miserable and margins earned in its traditional business were poor. <BR>&nbsp; In the post-liberalisation period, with the help of Unilever technology and having developed a significantly better understanding of consumer needs, Pond's has metamorphosed itself into a high-quality, mass-market, skin care business.<BR>&nbsp; A leader in its basic products, talcum powder and skin creams, Pond's made an enormous effort to understand consumer needs within its category and has leveraged the Unilever technical research capability to produce a series of products which provide skin care and skin improvement benefits relevant to the Indian consumer's needs. At the time of the business amalgamation with Hindustan Lever, Pond's was a profitable operation on the basis of its domestic business.</TD>
<TD width="34%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\35.GIF"></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; However, the post-liberalisation years have seen the demise of several skin care businesses which, at one point of time, were considered to be quite successful. Brands such as Vicco, Himani, Emami and many others have fallen by the wayside. Compared to these brands Remee has, indeed, managed to do well. <BR>&nbsp; However, the question for the future: what can Remee do now? The company has got time, but time, like everything else, will run out. <BR>&nbsp; Dinesh knows this very well. And, more importantly, Manu knows it. Remee must now take its first steps down the long arduous path of changing itself from being a distribution company to becoming a marketing company. <BR>&nbsp; It must now begin to understand, with the help of research, where necessary, who its potential consumers are, what their needs are, and how Remee can make products to best satisfy these needs. This does not cost a lot of money, nor does it need great marketing capability: merely the will to succeed and the ability to get ahead. <BR>&nbsp; It will just be a matter of time before we know whether Dinesh and Manu can actually do what is required; create a real marketing business out of a distribution company.</TD></TR>

<P>&nbsp; THE liberalisation process, which began in 1991, presents opportunities as well as threats -- it all depends on how a business is able to handle the micro and macro scenarios that emerged in its wake. Unfortunately, many businesses have not been able to get a good grip on the new situation, causing heartburn and other problems. <BR>&nbsp; Remee India seems to be no exception. The problem is its lack of clear business vision, business strategy and an inadequate preparation for the new challenges in the changed scenario. Before proceeding further, let's do a brief SWOT analysis of Remee India.</P></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Strengths: Its distribution network is Remee India's single biggest strength. And it also appears that the company has a loyal customer base and thus, one can presume, a reasonably good brand strength.&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp; Weaknesses: Although it has a strong brand, it appears that it is no longer relevant in the modern context, suffering as it does from the lack of a contemporary image for the emerging youth market. In addition, it has no significant product range, with nearly 60% of its sales coming from a single multi-purpose all-weather cream. Also, it doesn't have much money. <BR>&nbsp; Opportunities: Like in the case of everybody else, the liberalised environment offers potential market opportunities and there is also the prospect of a major emerging youth segment. <BR>&nbsp; Threats: The financial constraints, lack of a broad product range and dependence on a single brand/product renders Remee very vulnerable and makes it a prime takeover target. 
<P><A target="_parent" class=punch>Remee's problem is its lack of business vision. Business strategy and inadequate preparation for the new challenges in the changed scenario.</A></P>
<P>&nbsp; In this background, chairman Manu Pal and marketing director Dinesh Vira do not seem to have a very clear idea on the future direction of the business. You cannot manage a business on a day-to-day basis with survival in the short-term as the single aim, because that is not going to get the business anywhere. To stay in any business, one needs to have a very clear vision for the business from a medium- to long-term perspective. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both Pal and Vira place too much emphasis on their distribution strength. Unfortunately, they're missing the wood for the trees, since a distribution system can be effective only if you have relevant products to offer to the end consumer, that is, the product which the consumer wants. <BR>&nbsp; Being a very small player (Rs 30 crore turnover), Remee India can never hope to match the deep pockets of its competitors; it can't spend so much on marketing, new product development or technology upgradation. In this scenario, if I were Pal, I would go back to the drawing board, jot down the following key questions and try to find the answers: <BR>&nbsp; What is Remee India's core competence? <BR>&nbsp; What sort of competitive advantages can Remee India build vis-a-vis the competition? <BR>&nbsp; What is the salient brand strength (promise) which can be leveraged and extended to other product categories? <BR>&nbsp; Finding the answers would point the direction for the future. The skin care business, to my knowledge, is extremely competitive, dominated by powerful players with huge financial resources, mega-brands and huge distribution networks.</P></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="66%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; At the next stage, I would look for answers to the following key issues: In this highly competitive skin care industry, what is the 'niche' that Remee India can dominate? How fast and how soon would Remee India be able to enter this segment? What innovative and unique business processes can be created to be a successful player in this chosen 'niche'? This analysis is critical because business is all about focus -- it is very easy to get into several areas, trying to be everything to everybody. But you can end up being nothing to anybody.<BR>&nbsp; Several companies followed this focused approach and came up with success stories. One that comes readily to my mind is Velvette shampoo. In a market dominated by the likes of Lever and Procter &amp; Gamble, Velvette became a formidable brand in a very short time (obviously capitalising on the excise laws at that time) by choosing the sachet route. Velvette was one of the first to sell shampoo in sachets, rewriting the rules to become a significant player. Had it taken Lever head-on in the bottle segment for shampoos, it would probably have had no success.</TD>

<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Having decided to give the skin care business one last shot, I would suggest this five-step approach to Manu and Dinesh: <BR>&nbsp; Identify your core competencies. <BR>&nbsp; Identify a specific niche which can be created in the skin care segment -- surely this cannot be soaps. <BR>&nbsp; Create a business process which gives a competitive advantage -- this could be in the form of superior customer service, for example. <BR>&nbsp; Set up clear milestones, action standards and benchmarks, along with a time plan. <BR>&nbsp; Examine whether you can create some presence programmes (like the Goodsland experiment) which have a lot of impact within the resource constraints. <BR>&nbsp; At the end of the time frame, if Remee is unable to come up with a viable strategy, it would be better off selling the business. <BR>&nbsp; There are certain never-ending debates in the world of business such as economic return on investment versus volumes and marketshares; core versus non-core; short-term versus long-term. The trick is to identify the right balance between these polarities. Successful businesses are those that are able to find the correct balance. <BR>&nbsp; Dinesh, develop a proper plan on the lines suggested above, and give it all you have. There's enough room for big as well as small players in an industry, provided the small player knows his strengths and limitations and acts according to them. <BR>&nbsp; Good luck!</TD></TR>

<TR>
<TD width="93%" colSpan=4>&nbsp; STEVEN Fraser read the fax message as it rolled out of the machine. "We have discussed Tapas Roy's case amongst ourselves, with our legal advisors and HR director Maya Suri. We have also given due consideration to your feelings on the matter.&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; However, we feel Roy's involvement in the accident was marginal, unpremeditated and his subsequent actions a result of panic. We feel it would be too harsh and unnecessary to terminate his service. The matter has been recorded in his personal dossier...."<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Steven, the country manager of Pemento India, shook his head. "Very well, so be it..," he muttered, not entirely happy. Personally, he had nothing against Roy, but the entire episode was fraught with callousness and insensitivity, he felt.&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; Four months ago, Roy, a salesman with Pemento, had hitched a ride with a friend on his bike. Roy was attending to a sales call at Masjid Bunder in Mumbai and since he was late for a post-lunch area review meeting, he jumped on to a friend's bike to make it to Flora Fountain before 3 p.m. In the rush to get Roy to his office, the friend jumped a red light at Mohammed Ali Road and that was when he hit a pedestrian.&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; Intending to help the lady, Roy got off the bike, but his friend sped off. Rattled and fearing mob fury, Roy got into a taxi and fled too, but not before the public got the cab number. The lady, it turned out, was a school teacher whose husband was a lawyer" he filed a hit and run case.&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; Unable to find the bike rider, the police traced Roy through the cabby to the office of Pemento India and what followed was a nightmare. Roy claimed he did not know the person who drove the bike, that he had simply hitched a ride. That did not wash with the police or the lawyer who threatened to file a case of negligence. Eventually Roy was forced to identify his friend.&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="70%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; Steven was hopping mad. "This is absurd," he yelled. "It is a matter of a serious human rights violation and at Pemento we take a serious view of these issues. Roy is guilty on two counts: one, neglecting to help an injured party when he was partly responsible for the injury, and two, lying that he didn't know the driver of the bike. Clearly, he will have to leave Pemento.;"&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; HR director Maya Suri tried hard to defend Roy. "There is no court proceeding against him" the law has declared that his responsibility was minimal because he was not the driver. Roy simply happened to be there," said Maya. "Nonsense!" said Steven. "What view the law takes has nothing to do with human rights. That a responsible member of the company, on duty, acts in a manner not befitting the image of the company is the issue.&nbsp;</TD>
<TD width="30%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\40.GIF"></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; How can we take a lenient view of his lying, of ignoring a pedestrian who has been hurt by the very friend he was riding with? If he could act thus to save himself, could he not similarly lie to the detriment of the company to benefit himself? Can we be seen as a company that protects such a person?"<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Steven, Roy is young and ignorant," said Maya. "He `lied' as you say, but that was because he panicked. He had intended to help the victim, but fearing public ire, he fled. This is India, Steven, where mob fury is unmitigated and lethal. Then again, just because a friend was in the wrong does not make Roy an accomplice. Roy was in a fix and he was trying to manage it somehow. The fact that he came straight to the office and didn't disappear is proof enough of his honest intentions. To now say that Roy was also guilty of negligent behaviour appears unfair to me. We must stand by him."&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; "People must learn to accept responsibility even for their ignorance and for their inability to act responsibly," said Steven. "Social responsibility is an integral part of being a corporate citizen." Maya had then taken up the matter with the board, whose verdict was now lying in print on Steven's table.&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; Steven shrugged his shoulders and put the fax into a tray. Looking up he saw Dilip Khare, his personal assistant, standing before him with a pile of papers. "Dilip, Roy stays, that's the board's decision," he said. "What do you think?" "It's best to forgive and forget," said Dilip.&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; Steven considered the remark as he watched Dilip potter around the room putting away papers and files, pulling out folders and setting the alarm for a meeting at 4.30 p.m. As he put a post-it sticker which read `Stockist Mathur' on the clock, Steven smiled. "What would I do without you, Dilip?;" he asked.&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; Dilip was more than a personal assistant. He did much more than his job called for, which meant managing the life of his boss too. When the Frasers came to India, it was Dilip who arranged their stay, accompanied them on shopping sprees for linen and upholstery, cutlery and gadgets, even helped with their house lease, bought the car chosen by Mrs Fraser, organised its servicing, the petrol account, a driver... In short, he was the one person who had made their India posting manageable.&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; Steven was enormously overworked. If he left the workplace at 7 p.m., it was only to return to his study at 10 p.m. and slave away at market reports, plans, etc. Often he would call Dilip at 7 in the morning to dictate the tasks for the day, before he left for the plant. To make matters easy he had given Dilip a cellular phone. Later in the day they would talk and check on work done and new jobs to be done.&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; Dilip in turn managed Steven's deadlines, meetings, follow-ups on action plans etc. He was very efficient and Steven, who had come to India wondering about the quality of assistance he might have, was relieved. He encouraged Dilip to study further -- a course in sales management -- and promised him that his dream of getting into core operations would be fulfilled before Steven left India.&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5><A target="_parent" class=punch>After 18 months in the country, Steven had come to rely on Dilip Completely. He was his coping mechanism in the hectic life that the indian operation entailed. Now Dilip managed a lot more independently</A></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; At 26, Dilip was very ambitious with dreams of making it big, even to step into Steven's shoes if he could. So enamoured was he of Steven's style and demeanour that, within a few months, he took to growing a small French beard like his boss. Steven had no class biases, shared his cigars with Dilip and often took him out to lunch at the various five-star restaurants he dined at. It was Steven's desire to treat him as an equal, socially.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; By the end of 18 months, Steven had come to rely on Dilip completely. He was Steven's means of coping with the hectic life that the Indian operation entailed. Now Dilip managed a lot more independently, like collecting sales reports, collating them and e-mailing them to Steven wherever he was. Or issuing print orders for new stationery, buying supplies and even deciding on the supplier. Steven did not have the time, or the inclination, to look into such detail. He had trained Dilip adequately so that Dilip knew what was needed, anticipate them and execute them as necessary. The odd query that came directly to Steven from the market was efficiently passed on to the functionaries concerned for action. Pemento was now on the threshold of bigger things and the routine had to fall into place<BR>&nbsp; But Dilip's airs and his demeanour irked the managers. It was common to see him, feet on the table, a cigar stuck between his lips, talking on the phone when Steven was not around. At such moments if any of the managers walked in, Dilip would not correct his posture, but gesture to the visitor to sit, which was rather unbecoming of an personal assistant, it was felt.<BR>&nbsp; Dilip's growing irreverence towards his seniors did not escape Maya Suri's eye. "When you are working with a senior person like the country manager, your conduct comes under scrutiny. It is very important for you to be respectful and courteous, no matter what pressures you may be under," she had said to Dilip. "For instance," she said, "I wouldn't walk into Steven's room with a cigar stuck between my lips, as you are now doing." Dilip grinned and readily pulled the cigar off his mouth and stubbed it out on the floor.&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; Tough though she was, Maya knew that Dilip carried an efficient head on very young shoulders. At 26, he was like any youngster, full of cola and MTV and an attitude to match. But when it came to work, Dilip was the personification of efficiency and agility.&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="24%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\41.GIF"></TD>
<TD width="76%" colSpan=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;Three weeks later something was brought to Maya's notice. Her assistant, who was examining the medical bills, noticed a discrepancy in Dilip's bills. A doctor's bill for Rs 700 appeared to have been altered -- the number `7' was actually a `1' which was creatively changed to `7'. Of course, where the amount was written in words, the alteration was apparent.&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; Maya decided to investigate. Going up to the accountant, she asked to see some printing bills for Steven's jobs and found more evidence of hanky panky: a bill from a printer for visiting cards where the numbers had been changed, resulting in a premium of Rs 2,100. The bill was handwritten and there was no telephone number of the printer. But a fading rubber stamp revealed the address.&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;&nbsp; On her way home that evening, Maya drove to the printer and met a Singhal who confirmed he had printed some cards for the company. She asked for a quotation for a set of 250 cards and 1,000 letterheads" the figures were much lower than the amount mentioned on the bill she had seen that noon. Maya looked around and felt that this was hardly the kind of printer her company was likely to use.&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; "What other work have you done for us?" she asked. "I will be doing a big job this month for Dilip saab,;" he said. "And how much is it worth?" she asked. "Difficult to say, but I suppose it will be around Rs 15,000-20,000." "Have you quoted for it?" she asked.&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; "Dilip saab said he would decide. I have even left blank copies of my bills which he said he would fill himself," said the man.&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; As Maya probed more firmly and with authority, the story tumbled out. Dilip would bill as he decided and when the company paid, the printer was to return 40% of the bill amount in cash to Dilip and be assured of more jobs in the future.&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; Maya decided to mention her fears to Steven. He was naturally very surprised. "No, no, it can't be, not Dilip. Not that boy. You may be making a mistake, or that printer probably has a grouse against Dilip,;" he said.&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; But when Maya mentioned the medical bills, it was too much for Steven. "Good Lord!" he said. "I wish this is not true." But it was very true. Steven confronted Dilip.&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; "Do you have anything to say about this?" he asked.&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; "I don't know what you are talking about," said Dilip. Maya, who until now had decided to keep the printer out, said: "The printer tells me you have blank bills which you fill..."&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; "That's a lot of rubbish," said Dilip. "Why would I do anything like that?"<BR>&nbsp; "That's what I thought too," said Maya, "but then I saw these bills for visiting cards and letterheads and felt that Rs 4,500 was far too expensive!"&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; "That's what I thought too, but the job was done and I decided not to use the printer again," lied Dilip.&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; But Maya kept the pressure on. She mentioned the medical bills and other lapses and eventually Dilip confessed he was in dire need of money. "It won't happen again," he promised.&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; For both Maya and Steven, Dilip's dishonesty was too much to take. Later Maya said: "Dilip cannot stay with us any more, he will have to go."&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; Steven was half expecting that, yet he was taken aback by the finality of her words. "He is a young person, ambitious, aspiring to go places, stars in his eyes and so full of life. Does he really have to be sacked for this?"&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; "It is certainly improper to keep him on," replied Maya.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5><A target="_parent" class=punch>After Dilip's dishonest practices came to light, steven was shocked, but reluctant to let him go. "He is a young person, ambitious and so full of life. Does he have to be sacked for this?" He asked</A></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; What would we achieve?" asked Steven. "Understand what I am saying. We need to also take corrective steps for his own sake. I am sure Dilip is mesmerised by the enchanting world he is trying to conquer. Can't we help him change? After all he is from a nice family, we could help him move forward rather than get stuck with what I see as a moral problem, which certainly can be overcome."&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; Maya was taken aback by Steven's attitude. "How can we condone his actions?" she asked.&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; "Look at the situation, Maya," entreated Steven, confused and overwhelmed by what had happened. "The amount is too small, the person too young... a junior who is on a learning curve, not just professionally, but personally too."&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Maya was amazed. "Steven, this is an integrity issue and has nothing to do with seniority or the magnitude!"&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; "The issue certainly is of seniority and magnitude," said Steven. "If a senior manager had defrauded the company, my stand would have been that he had the opportunity and the responsibility to act in an ethically proper manner. His seniority indicates that the company has spent a lot of time with him grooming him, imparting corporate values and also given him a chance to lead a noble life. And by virtue of his qualities he was given charge of a responsible portfolio for which he was expected to behave soundly and have moral qualities. Therefore, when such a senior manager is found guilty of misdemeanour, there can be no doubt that he can't continue in the firm.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;"But in the case of Dilip, I see two things: he is young and as such inexperienced in the ways of the world" he is still learning about the need for sound conduct and the need for ethical behaviour. Besides, he is beginning his career, on the learning curve, which covers not only functional skills but ethical skills as well. Therefore, we should give him a chance." <BR>&nbsp; But Maya felt his retention would be seen as `overlooking' an impropriety and not as `forgiveness' which in any case was out of place in an organisation. Were organisations to now dabble in reforming people, when their sole purpose was business? <BR>&nbsp; And this was the same Steven who had argued ceaselessly over Roy's misdemeanour, insisting he had no place in the organisation. Yet now, Steven was seeking lighter treatment for an obviously dishonest Dilip, felt Maya.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="70%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; "I am not condoning what Dilip has done," said Steven, "but I can also see his other side -- he is hardworking and efficient. I am keen to rescue Dilip from the abyss of dishonesty." <BR>&nbsp; Steven felt that sacking a person from his job could damage his career and life. Should a company exercise such a right irresponsibly, he asked. "He has always done a great job and been an example of efficiency. What has happened now is an aberration. What is our social or corporate responsibility in this situation? Declare he is a bad egg and sack him, or do we say, okay he was dishonest, but we are going to help him out of what could become a serious behavioural issue?"&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;"If I let him go, I will be setting a precedent whereby I will not be able to challenge any integrity issue in the future with credibility or authority," said Maya.</TD>
<TD width="30%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\42.GIF"></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; "Not at all," said Steven. "You must challenge and question each integrity issue whenever it crops up. But I am also saying that every time it occurs we must contribute to reform." <BR>&nbsp; "Steven, at the end of the day, we are running a business in the expectation that our people will act with responsibility and integrity. If I have a doubt about even five people in my organisation, whether I like it or not, it will be reflected in my behaviour with them. And it will be impossible to work with them as a team. For, each time I ask them to do something, I will find myself triple-checking their motives and actions. I will not be able to ensure their commitment. What is to stop a person who rationalises wrong behaviour once from repeating it? So, I have a problem. And if my team realises that the consequence is only going to be counselling, there will be havoc! How am I then to take action against persons who travel economy and charge business class fares? Or even a peon who takes Rs 10 for an errand? If the organisation is seen as one that does not punish dishonest behaviour, it will become corrupt. Then what?"<BR>&nbsp; Did we punish Roy's misdemeanour?" asked Steven. "Why wasn't that an integrity issue? Please do not think I am being biased. I really am trying to understand what your reasoning is," he said honestly. "Was it because Dilip's actions are quantifiable in money terms while Roy's is not? Why was Roy's dishonesty different, Maya?" he asked. <BR>&nbsp; "Stealing is different from what happened to Roy," explained Maya. "Stealing or defrauding has a certain planning and deliberation attached to it. If you get away with it once, the chances are high that you will repeat it. Which is what Dilip did. He played with bills not once but thrice. But Roy is going to be doubly careful that he does not get into the same situation. What happened to him was an accident, there was no premeditation. There was not even the intention to hurt." <BR>&nbsp; "But Roy lied too, remember?" said Steven. "He said he did not know the person who gave him a ride on the bike." <BR>&nbsp; "Let's face it Steven, it is not my business to be a watchdog of integrity in the manner you are saying. In Dilip's case, there has been a deviation from accepted behaviour, or behaviour expected of a person holding a job such as his. Roy's situation was not `on the job'. The maximum I am willing to do is not give him a bad certificate. If it is reform that you are seeking, we could ask him to resign rather than sack him." <BR>&nbsp; Steven thought for a while. Then he said: "In doing so are you being fair and honest to the next organisation that he will join? Now what happens to your ethics? You know what will happen? Angered by the whole episode, he will go to another organisation and say he left Pemento because Steven and Maya were terrible people to work with." <BR>&nbsp; Maya, as head of HR, was in a dilemma. Should Pemento sack Dilip or reform him? As far as she saw it, what Dilip did was blatantly dishonest and age had nothing to do with it. It was an integrity issue. And it had to do with misdemeanour on the job. Dilip was handling a very senior manager's portfolio and the derived authority and power such a position gave him was abused, she felt.</TD></TR>

He heads the manpower development group at ITC.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;</I> DILIP Khare's case is a tragic one. An efficient quick learner with a supportive boss investing in his growth, he is a victim of the `now' culture which urges people to attain immediate, personal gratification. Dilip is also a victim of accelerated growth and responsibility which was badly managed and which he could not cope with on his own. But ultimately, he is a victim of his own vaulting ambitions and values.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;Steven Fraser arrived in India with his own fears of not being able to manage in a new culture and worried about the `quality of assistance he might have'. He was relieved to find in Dilip a hard-working, efficient and agile resource who also helped him settle in (`linen, upholstery, cutlery and gadgets... house lease, car, petrol account, driver...). <BR>&nbsp; At work, Steven found Dilip a dependable resource who managed his `deadlines, meetings, follow-ups on action plans etc'. Within 18 months Steven had come to `rely on Dilip completely'. <BR>&nbsp; Their relationship also became a dependent one. Steven treated Dilip as an equal at work and socially -- taking him out for lunch, sharing his cigars with him, etc. These twin forces of task and emotional dependencies made Steven delegate more and more authority to Dilip. There are no data in the case to suggest that there were checks and balances. <BR>&nbsp; The first evidence that Dilip was not being able to manage his new-found powers came in the form of aberrant behaviour. Sitting with his feet up on the table, cigar clutched in teeth and gesturing to visitors to sit while talking on the phone -- this behaviour would not be tolerated in any Indian organisation, no matter how senior the manager. That Dilip -- who was 26 years old and very junior -- displayed such behaviour is evidence that he had begun seeing himself as above the organisation or larger than the institution.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5><A target="_parent" class=punch>HR Head Maya Suri was not willing to send out the message at pemento that as long as people were efficient they could be dishonest</A></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;Every organisation runs on basic beliefs and values that express themselves as norms -- unwritten rules about what people can and cannot do. Dilip had neither the power nor the credibility to unilaterally change the rules of `expected behaviour'. Yet he persisted -- removing the cigar from his mouth only after Maya Suri, the HR head, pointed it out to him, and without an apology. He seemed to really believe he could live by his own rules. <BR>&nbsp; At this stage it becomes necessary to compare Dilip's case with that of Tapas Roy's. Roy was a frightened coward who fled from the scene of the accident `fearing mob fury' (very real in India) and did lie -- to protect his friend who had sped to ensure that Roy was in time for his area review meeting. His behaviour was a reaction to the situation he found himself in and the feeling of panic within him.<BR>&nbsp; Dilip's case was totally different. He altered the amounts in his medical bill. He did the same with the printer's bill and then set up a system where he had blank bills which he could fill at will. This is very cold-blooded and planned behaviour -- very different from that exhibited by Roy who was reacting in panic. Though, after trying to bluster his way through Maya Suri's confrontation, Dilip did say that he was in dire need of money, there is no case data to tell us if he had a sick parent or gambling debts that created internal pressures that drove him to cheat Pemento. It seems more likely that Dilip had begun believing that he was the cleverest around and that normal rules did not apply to him.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="70%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; In Roy's case Steven had said: "People must learn to accept responsibility even for their ignorance and for their inability to act responsibly." Which is very true. It is sad to see him pleading for Dilip because of his own emotional dependency on him ("the amount is too small", "he is too young... on a learning curve", "inexperienced in the ways of the world", etc.) He is even concerned about what Dilip will say about them to his next employer (`Steven and Maya were terrible people to work with').&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; No matter how personally painful it is, the head of HR in a company has to keep at least two parameters in mind when taking decisions regarding individuals: How is it going to impact all the other employees? Will it be fair to them? Do our current systems and norms allow this decision to be taken? Is this such an exceptional case that it warrants disrupting the current ways?</TD>
<TD width="30%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\44.GIF"></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; What message will this decision send out regarding what we consider `valuable' in our organisation -- what we believe in and want practised? What impact will it have on the organisational culture? <BR>&nbsp; Maya Suri is absolutely right. It is `an integrity issue and has nothing to do with seniority or the magnitude'. She was not willing for a message to go out in Pemento that as long as people were task-successful they could be dishonest. She is again correct when she says that in today's fast-paced work life, people cannot work effectively with others if they have to spend time and energy `triple-checking their motives, their intentions and actions'. <BR>&nbsp; Maya has to ask Dilip to go. At best she can ask him to resign. She does not need to give him any letter of recommendation and Dilip is not stupid enough to give her name as a reference. It does not matter what Dilip tells his future employers regarding Pemento. What should matter to Dilip is that he got away lightly. <BR>&nbsp; If he is really intelligent, he will use this experience to change his framework of values. No matter what interpretation he had earlier made of `cola and MTV and attitude', he should understand that honesty is the best policy in the long run. </TD></TR>

Steven's role entails dispensing justice objectively, firmly wearing his organisation hat, with total impartiality. <BR>&nbsp; Steven should arrive at a judgment that is based on the facts available before him, and not on what they could have been or where they could end up going. <BR>&nbsp; Steven did not perform his role well. He was not objective -- he viewed both situations through the filters of his personal views and personal comfort, rather than as a custodian of the organisation's well-being.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;Thus, Roy was to be indicted because of Steven's passion for, and particular perspective on, human rights (what is the organisation's stand on this matter?). Dilip, on the other hand, was to be let off because he happened to be an asset to Steven (and his wife as well!) personally. <BR>&nbsp; Steven was not impartial -- that is, he did not use the same yardstick for everyone. Roy's youth and stars in his eyes were not to be used as an excuse for Roy's behaviour, but Dilip's action was sought to be condoned by Steven for the very same reason. <BR>&nbsp; Steven chose to look beyond the evidence in both cases -- there is hard evidence in one case (Dilip's) of proven premeditated cheating and an intention to continue and in the other (Roy's) there is hard evidence that there is no court case pending against him, and the law had declared that his responsibility was minimal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD width="100%" colSpan=5><A target="_parent" class=punch>Leaders must make sure that they treat the value system as non-negotiable. Because once you start compromising, there's no end to it</A></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Maya Suri was all that Steven was not -- she was objective, looked at the cases from the standpoint of the organisation, and dispensed justice impartially based on the facts. <BR>&nbsp; Let's talk about defalcation as an issue. Unfortunately, cheating an organisation of money is not an isolated case, and most of us in leadership positions are confronted with it at some time or another. <BR>&nbsp; In my view, an employee cheating an organisation is no different from your son stealing from his classmate, or an organisation cheating customers. It involves taking away wealth that belongs to someone else (the stakeholders), and is not rightfully yours. If this kind of behaviour is allowed to go unchecked, it sends a signal to the entire organisation that this is dacoit land, and you can get away with it. <BR>&nbsp; Yet often, and rather distressingly, many organisations do not look at cheating in such black and white terms. They respond with greater severity towards those who are easy to replace in the organisation, and show a surprising amount of tolerance towards those that are difficult to dispense with.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="75%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; Further, the more senior a person is, the more of a blind eye is turned, and excuses are made for his behaviour. It is not uncommon for A to be found cheating by his boss B and for B's boss C to say: "Forget it, he is an asset to the company." What does A do in this situation? If Steven's view had prevailed (as it may have, had Steven owned a large chunk of the organisation), what should Maya Suri do? Be pragmatic and say she did her best, but she is merely the professional manager; or be idealistic and leave the organisation? <BR>&nbsp; If she chooses the former route, one thing is certain -- Maya will become a less effective personnel manager and a diminished leader in the eyes of many in the organisation. And once the erosion begins in the organisation, there's no way of stopping it.&nbsp;</TD>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="25%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\46.GIF"></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;&nbsp; I firmly believe that organisations must have clear and well understood value systems. Just as many of us tell our children "in this family, this will not be condoned", so too should it be in organisations.<BR>&nbsp; Organisations cannot be governed by rules alone -- they need to have a value system that is shared by everybody. People with a dissonant personal value system are then welcome to not join, or to leave. <BR>&nbsp; The biggest challenge for the leader is to establish and disseminate a value system throughout the organisation. This then often obviates the need for him to take on the roles of judge and jury. <BR>&nbsp; However, having an organisational value system in place is not good enough -- it needs to be constantly reinforced, because there will always be compelling business or personal reasons which make it tempting to follow another path. <BR>&nbsp; And finally, leaders in organisations must make sure that they treat the value system as non-negotiable. Because once you start negotiating on it, there's no stopping. The first step, as always is the hardest to take. <BR>&nbsp; Does all this sound utopian, idealistic? Is it the ramblings of someone who belongs to an older generation? Or does it have something to do with good business sense? I would like to think it does!</TD></TR>

<TD width="99%" colSpan=4><A target="_parent" class=punch>NRI Alok Aggarwal's dreams of setting up a hotel in India came a cropper in the face of red tape at the lower levels of the Government Machinery.</A></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="99%" colSpan=4>&nbsp; ALOK Aggarwal looked out of the aircraft window as it taxied down the runway. "I hope this visit to India is going to be successful," he mused. He was pinning his hopes on getting the land purchase through for his hotel project. &nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; His last visit had left him with a lot of anxiety and if he was returning, it was at the behest of Sanat Dani, the IAS officer friend who was full of optimism.<BR>&nbsp; Alok heard the man next to him, a Swede, hum a happy tune. Happily, he told Alok: "I am really looking forward to this visit to India. I have been waiting a whole year for it! I must see the Taj Mahal." He went on say that he was booked on the Palace on Wheels, an experience he was looking forward to. "Rajasthan is a beautiful state and the Taj Mahal is a fitting tribute to its beauty," he added.&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; Startled, Alok said: "The Taj is not in Rajasthan. It is in Uttar Pradesh."&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; "Oh? But it can't be, my travel agent told me it is in Rajasthan," said the Swede, a trifle confused by what Alok, an Indian, was saying.&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; Alok could see from where he had obtained that impression. The Palace on Wheels was a Rajasthan train which ended its journey in Agra, doing the golden triangle of Jaipur, Delhi and Agra. Naturally the Swede thought that all that it covered was Rajasthan, Alok thought.<BR>&nbsp; The Swede's remark was on Alok's mind as he alighted from the aircraft. "What a pity," he thought, "70% of the tourists who visit Agra do so without realising that they have been in UP. We have an industry which we can build into something terrific, it offers the basic opportunities, but we have such a poor image, that even the tour operators believe that the Taj is in Rajasthan! Obviously, people at the ground level have not done the job of promoting the Taj as a UP destination. In the process, the state does not get mileage or the tourists," he mused. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="69%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; And that was precisely what he had told Sanat on his last visit. "I think India is not being marketed properly to the world," he had said. Alok had come to India after 20 years, to explore a location for his hotel project. A wealthy UK-based businessman, he was keen on participating in the growing, booming recreation and tourism industry. And it was Sanat who was playing guide and advisor.<BR>&nbsp; Sanat had sounded optimistic. He had done his homework and identified a place called Kinno Valley, a beautiful stretch dotted with historic monuments. "You will love it," he had told Alok. He described its beautiful lakes and open stretches of land, which appeared to Alok ideal for sailing and paragliding. This central Indian state had scenic places ideal for a hotel.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sanat had sat with a map and showed Alok the tourist spots; they all looked well-connected on the map, appearing as if a simple train ride could take you through them.</TD>
<TD width="31%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\49.GIF"> </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; But the reality was that there was no servicing support. There was one historic site, Bilbit Point, which was visited by many tourists. But this lay near the state's border and tourists dropped in and out, giving the rest of the state the go-by. <BR>&nbsp; Alok had been worried. It appeared to him that many states were similarly afflicted. Alok had found that Kinno Valley did not ring a bell with tour operators. Even the largest tour operator hadn't been interested in going beyond Bilbit Point. A hotel would need commitment from local operators, connections with foreign operators, other tourism projects to come up... only then did it stand a chance of succeeding, he had felt. <BR>&nbsp; But Sanat had been optimistic. "These are image issues and you can easily work them into your marketing plan," he had urged. Kinno Valley was breathtaking. An old fort of stunning architectural beauty stood in the middle of lush green landscape, the slopes on one side were ideal for hand-gliding, and on the other side there was a river for para-sailing. It was an ideal interim destination between Bilbit and the city. Alok had been thrilled with the place, but the fact that there was no reliable transport from Bilbit bothered him.<BR>&nbsp; He had spoken to the railways. The spot he had chosen was slightly off the main line, an hour's drive from the nearest station. To make the circuit meaningful to the tourist the timings of trains connecting to the main gateway points like Delhi, Mumbai and so on needed to be adjusted. But the railways told him that that was not possible, at least not soon. "Can you run a rail bus to my destination, since there is a branch line running to Kinno Valley?" he had asked. He had been willing to guarantee traffic, but Alok was told by discouraging tour operators that it would take the railways five years to decide on this. <BR>&nbsp; Then he had gone to the transport operators to find out how many air-conditioned buses plied in the region. The transporter said: "First get the tourists, then we will see about the buses." Sanat had led a distraught Alok away. "Talking to tour operators is the wrong point to start," he had said. "Right now Kinno Valley is a dead site for them. Naturally they will sound discouraging. Why don't we meet the land development agencies and check what plots are available? Even if you get a plot within 3 km of Kinno Valley, you are in business."</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5><A target="_parent" class=punch>After months of searching, a plot was found for the hotel. But it was far from perfect: It was in a marshy area, there was no regular water supply, power or even sewage disposal facilities</A></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;&nbsp; That was where his last trip to India had ended. Alok returned to the UK with a dream of Kinno Valley and a promise from Sanat that he would identify a plot for him. <BR>&nbsp; And Sanat had done his homework, much to Alok's delight when they met the next day. "I have managed to earmark the perfect site for you from where you get a beautiful view of the fort and the lake. What's more, it is under the state development corporation, so you will get all the facilities," he said. "You must finalise the project site on this visit." <BR>&nbsp; The next day as they drove to Kinno Valley, Sanat spoke eloquently about the site. "It's perfect, the adjoining areas are also under development, which means all your ancillary needs are also taken care of," said Sanat.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet when they reached the land development office and asked to see the plot, Alok was told: "Not this one but you can take the third on the left... 301-C." Alok was alarmed. The piece of land he had seen and on which his entire dream was based was now not to be his. Worse, Sanat told him that the plot he was now being offered overlooked a slum and its location took the approach 3 km away from the main line. <BR>&nbsp; There was worse to come. It appeared that no one had done a detailed evaluation of the levelling requirement: it was a low-lying plot and needed to be developed. "Can you develop the land and make it ready for purchase?" asked Alok. Yes they could, but the extra charges of development would be added to the land cost -- a shocking Rs 6 lakh! <BR>&nbsp; The reality was that no development could take place till an advance was collected from the buyer. In fact, the land hadn't even been acquired from the farmer-owner until a month ago, a fact Alok learnt from a certain Jarnail Singh, whom he met outside the land agency's office. "Don't touch 301-C," said Singh. "They are still negotiating with the owner on that, and he has gone to court on the acquisition price." <BR>&nbsp; Alok thought about 301-C. His entire project proposal was going out of the window, but he decided not to give up yet.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="29%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\50.GIF"> </TD>
<TD width="71%" colSpan=3>&nbsp;Then the horror stories unfolded one by one. Yes, there were water and sewerage facilities, the authorities said, but he found no connections were laid out to 301-C, although it was a developed plot. The local water board, which had been asked to lay the connections, had said that it did not have enough pressure to support new connections, nor enough water. <BR>&nbsp; "When will it be done?" Sanat asked the water engineer.<BR>&nbsp; "See, it is not in our priority list for the next five years, because we have other pressures. Some Janata colony has to come up super-fast so I can't give any connections for some time," the engineer said.<BR>&nbsp; "But funds were earmarked for the water supply by the state agencies," argued Sanat.<BR>&nbsp; "Yes, but we have so many expenses, how long can such a small amount of money last?" said the man.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Jarnail Singh, who was following Alok's inquiries closely, led him out of the agency office gently. "Don't waste your time, let me show you 301-C and you will understand why," he said. <BR>&nbsp; They drove 3 km and arrived at a huge stretch of water and marsh under. "Where's the land?" asked Alok tentatively. <BR>&nbsp; Singh laughed heartily. "That's the beauty of it," he said. "It is cender the water." <BR>&nbsp; Alok was shocked. Singh went on to explain: "There is something wrong with the drainage connection on the adjoining plot. The back pressure builds up and it overflows... and this is what you get. And don't think the development institution is going to do it; you will have to run around and get it sorted out." <BR>&nbsp; "There are more complications," added Singh. "You will have to get certificates to prove that your effluents are okay, your drainage is fine etc. Now do you see? It can overflow onto your land, but you have to get the certificate to get it out! You have to set up solid waste management systems on your land, prove to the authorities that you have the capacity to do it..." Singh clearly had done a lot of research on 301-C. "The sewage capacity of that main drain going the next 15 km is enough to handle the discharge from a 30-room establishment," he explained. Alok's hotel would be viable only if it had 70 rooms, but now it appeared that he would be able to construct only a 30-room hotel! He would not get permission to set up a evacuation system for a 70-room hotel because such a hotel would discharge more solid waste than the pipe could bear. <BR>&nbsp; "That straightaway affects the project's viability," thought Alok. <BR>&nbsp; Yet, Alok decided he was going to see this thing through to its logical conclusion. To Sanat he said: "I remain hopeful. Let us meet the development agencies again and evaluate the possibility of providing the sewage and water connection and the certificate." <BR>&nbsp; But Alok's problems were not over. The developing agency said: "It will be difficult... we do not have the funds to build an additional evacuation facility."<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that stumped Sanat. "But this land has 50 plots. Surely you have permission to create the necessary connections!" he said. <BR>&nbsp; "I understand," said the sewage officer. "We built 50 plots for various commercial activities, but we built the evacuation capacity for only 25... We will be unable to give the approval. We will have to wait for the upgradation budget." <BR>&nbsp; At the power department, Alok was told that he would have to buy the transformer himself and the department would help in the installation. That meant another Rs 20-30 lakh, excluding the last mile of wiring for which he would have to pay himself. Alok's project was slowly becoming unviable and unbearable.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5><A target="_parent" class=punch>The problem was that even though the economy was liberalised, things remained more or less the same at the grassroots level of government. There was no urgency in pushing through projects</A></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Singh said: "Bhaisaab, they may have sanctioned 5 kva power supply, but you will have to run around to get the connections. That can take any amount of time. Meanwhile you will have to invest in a power back-up and start business with your own generator. You can't wait for them." <BR>&nbsp; By now, Alok was thoroughly disappointed. "To set up a hotel I not only have to sell the hotel service, but much before I get there I have to sell the state, the destination, build the related services and the service culture. I have to set up the industry," he thought. His project's success did not appear to lie in investment management as much as `environment' management. "Do I manage the environment or do I manage my core skill of running hotels?" he asked Sanat.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sanat wished Alok wouldn't despair. He had targeted foreign tourism investments of Rs 60 crore. If Alok agreed to set up the project, Rs 40 crore would be taken care of. It was a great idea to have a sophisticated hotel in his state. But Alok was talking about law and order, about water supply, effluent management... things which he had no answers to.<BR>&nbsp; "I need to interact with the local panchayats and make sure they accept a stake in this. I will also have to rope in the public works department (PWD), the sanitation department, the electricity board. In short, I will have to market the hotel to a plethora of colleagues in different departments -- half in the central government, half in the state government -- who will have to deliver. And I have to also play the catalyst! What a job!" rued Sanat. <BR>&nbsp; The following day Sanat called Vijay Phadnis, a friend and batchmate, in faraway Patna. "Liberalisation may have come in, but the opportunities have not permeated down the line," said Phadnis. "Only when it reaches and impacts the man at the grassroots level will there be a change. We all generate statements of good intentions without taking any action to make it happen. All the men from the PWD, water supply and other departments, you will find, are unable to act because they do not have the funds. Somebody is sitting on a file, or somebody is on leave! The criticality of the project is lost in the confusion. Then again, each department officer sees it from his own point of view, in terms of timing. One will say: `This thing must be done six months later, not today' because he has other priorities. Or he simply says, `Karengey', which is neither here nor there."</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="69%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; "Take what happened to another investor recently," continued Phadnis. "The electricity department had sanctioned a transformer, but the linesman would not bring it. What do you do? Your problems are going to be of this nature.&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; Of course the government will woo you, the investor. But thereafter you are at the mercy of operating staff like the local inspector and the linesman! And they will have many reasons for delay or procrastination! The sad bit is none of them even realises how it is affecting the local economy.<BR>&nbsp; "Meanwhile, Alok was on the verge of abandoning his project, just like the way his cousin Raghav had given up his plastics project. In fact Raghav had cautioned him, having spent Rs 44 lakh and eight months on his project, only to find that he could not get the clearance of the environment department, which claimed there was a small bird sanctuary 20 km from his site.</TD>
<TD width="31%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\51.GIF"> </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; The fact was, the so-called sanctuary was virtually defunct, since no bird had stayed there in the past 19 years. But what had irked him the most was that neither the land agency nor anybody else knew about it, or had warned him.<BR>&nbsp; "Mind you, when I spoke to the chairman of the local electricity board, the head of the PWD and the water supply department... they all wanted the project. They were also willing to earmark funds for it. Still it wasn't getting done. Why? I will tell you," he had said. <BR>&nbsp; "The local junior engineer (JE) sitting there doesn't know the importance of delivering for that particular project. I felt that it was not communicated to him in his language. These very heads of departments later threw up their hands and despaired, blaming the lethargy of the junior staff," he said. "I even went to the extent of telling them: `This is a Rs 25 crore project. If your department spends even Rs 20 lakh inviting these operating officers to half-day seminars at a hotel and explains the value of this investment to the economy of the region and the importance of their involvement, you will find that the responses of 70-80% of the officers will become a lot better'." <BR>&nbsp; You know," said Raghav's father, "it has nothing to do with lethargy. There are many intermediary departments whose roles are critical to a project. Yet, no one department sees it as critical enough for it to complete its portion of the work. Each one will do it when it is convenient for it to do the job. There is no joint feeling of ownership of the project." <BR>&nbsp; "For that," said Raghav, "every officer in every department must feel he is a prominent part of the investment execution process. He has to feel that he is the one who is enabling the investment to take shape and reap the harvest. He has to see his contribution as a critical part of the investment. <BR>&nbsp; "So what is really required is a catalyst's role which sensitises the lower-level officials to their importance in economic development," continued Raghav animatedly. "Economic development is a big word with big ramifications. People like your JE feel it concerns ministers and economists and highly placed bureaucrats. No! Economic development should take place at the grassroots and only then can it travel upwards." <BR>&nbsp; Then it was a mere drawing room debate on India that was far away. Today it was real and happening to Alok. "How do I make an impact on these various departments and make them `want' to enable my project?" wondered Alok. "If I can do so, I will have begun the process of economic development. These catalysts of development, these IAS officers, the heads of departments, see their role as primarily interfacing with external investors. But they have a bigger role as internal marketers to the government system without asking for greater powers and authority. Just be trainers, motivators and enablers. More than interfacing with external investors, their customers are the men down the line." <BR>&nbsp; Sanat was very keen to see Alok proceed with his investment. But he could see that Alok was getting put off by what he thought were the softer issues. "I can bring in the money, the support, the equipment, I can train and develop people for the jobs, but can you ensure the security, the permissions, the lines, the connections?" Alok was asking. "I need a rail service, rail bus, security, land clearances and the electricity. How are you going to assure me that all this is possible?" Alok said. <BR>&nbsp; Sanat had thought he had a well-intentioned investment in place, but he now realised that he had not bargained for the state machinery's complex relationships. "I know we have to change it, but I don't know where to start. Is the issue planning or is it execution? Or something else?" he wondered. <BR>&nbsp; "How do you get industry to perform, the efforts and the revenues to percolate down the line?," he wondered.</TD></TR>

<P>NRI comes. NRI despairs. NRI goes back. The details varied, but the gist was all the same.

<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; But the pernicious regime of licences and controls combined with the delays, lethargy and corruption so deeply ingrained in the system sapped all their energy and enthusiasm. Chastened, if also a bit saddened, they returned to the seclusion and comfort of their first world endeavours <BR>&nbsp; Not to worry. That was back in the eighties. Post-reforms, there is a dramatic difference. No more running around for licences and permits. No more endless waiting in the corridors of power. India has unleashed the magic of the marketplace. The country is now a haven of opportunity for get-up-and-go type of entrepreneurship.<BR>&nbsp; Is it? Decidedly no, if Alok Aggarwal's experience is any guide. Between his two trips, 20 years apart, nothing much has changed -- not at the grassroots, anyway. Surely, there is no need any longer to negotiate through the complex and frustrating bureaucracy in Delhi or to lobby underhand for loans from financial institutions. But that is small change. At the cutting-edge level, it is business as usual with no coordination among agencies, no motivation among staff and no accountability. <BR>&nbsp; Therein lies a powerful lesson for our political leaders and top bureaucrats. Championing reforms at the top is necessary, but not sufficient. There is a need for understanding, commitment and ownership of the reform ethos down the line.</TD></TR>

<TD width="100%" colSpan=5><A target="_parent" class=punch>Championing reforms at the top is necessary, but not sufficint. There is a need for commitment and ownership of the reform ethos down the line &nbsp;</A></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; So what can be done about it? Several things. First and foremost, within the government, the constituency for reforms must be deepened and broadened. As of now, our reform process resembles guerrilla warfare, with the aggressors, a small band of ministers and technocrats, fighting the rest of the system. Such blitzkrieg type of manoeuvres with secrecy may have been necessary in the initial stabilisation phase of the reforms process, but are certainly inimical to the longer-drawn structural adjustment phase. Early on in the reforms process, it was fashionable to say that reforms have not travelled beyond North Block. Nearly a decade down the line, they do not seem to have gone much farther. Many ministers and civil servants in peripheral economic ministries and state governments have often complained that they have not been taken on board on the logic, agenda or sequencing of reforms, even as their participation is vital to the success of the exercise. <BR>&nbsp; If that be the situation at the very top, is it any surprise that the reform ethos has not percolated down the hierarchy? The indifference, apathy and lack of motivation that Alok confronted are the result of weak, if also halfhearted, political management of reforms within the government itself. As his cousin Raghav tells Alok, these people at the operating level have never been told the importance of their respective inputs in the overall scheme of things or how their non-performance can be costly not just to a project or to an individual but to the whole gamut of development. But who is to exhort and encourage them when their bosses themselves do not feel a sense of ownership or commitment?</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="69%" colSpan=3>Motivating employees at all levels of the delivery system, right down to the cutting-edge level, as pointed out by Raghav, is important, but again not sufficient. We need deep-rooted structural reform of our civil service. The public sector is such a secure haven of employment that there is just no danger in not performing. Nobody in the government gets sacked. Everyone gets promoted by the mere passage of time. The committed and the efficient do not get any rewards or recognition. They only get saddled with additional work. The corrupt and the inefficient not only survive, but even thrive. This generous, inclusive and non-discriminating system that we have perfected is a sure recipe for sapping motivation and breeding corruption.At the very least, we need to make our government employees accountable for results through a ruthless system of rewards and penalties.</TD>
<TD width="31%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\53.GIF"> </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; A 'soft' state is hardly compatible with hard-nosed reforms. <BR>&nbsp; Alok was understandably despondent that he had to fritter away his energy on managing the 'environment' rather than building on his core competence. He mused about a system that would 'demand' the enterprise that he was willing and able to 'supply.' This should be a pointer to government agencies on where their priorities should lie -- in operational level planning and in coordination and monitoring. <BR>&nbsp; Economic reforms have unleashed competition among states for investment. Globe-trotting chief ministers, glossy brochures, slick presentations -- all promising sops and subsidies to potential investors -- are the staple of this competition. Alok's case suggests that what potential investors value much more than sops is an environment of rule of law and adequate and good quality physical and social infrastructure. In short, the state should concentrate on reducing the quantity and increasing the quality of governance. <BR>&nbsp; Finally, a word of advice to Alok and his ilk. Do not despair. India is changing, albeit slowly. Remember that we also have an enviable record here of never having retracted on reforms, notwithstanding the varying ideologies of the frequently changing governments. Do not look for the quick buck. Come here for the long haul. You will find reward and fulfillment.</TD></TR>

<P>ALOK Aggarwal is experiencing the classic clash between entrepreneurs and the bureaucracy. It is a well-known fact that unless the bureaucracy itself turns entrepreneurial, development does not occur. Governments and entrepreneurship may seem a contradiction in terms, but if one goes by the definition of entrepreneurship -- "the process of shifting resources from areas of low yield to areas of high yield" -- the government, whether at the state or central level, has displayed varying degrees of entrepreneurial spirit in the past. Take, for instance, the green revolution or the basic industrial infrastructure which has been created in the country.</P></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Just as the private sector has had to learn new paradigms of successful entrepreneurship, the paradigms of entrepreneurship within the government need to change. Resources for development are more efficiently deployed if the central and state governments act as catalysts and regulators -- and not as executors -- of development. Like in the case of the green revolution, where the government mercifully left the execution to the private initiative of the farmers, but was an important catalyst. The problem, as experienced by Alok, is that this message of paradigm change has not reached the operating level within governments.<BR>&nbsp; The local junior engineer, the sewerage department, the power department and so on are used to an environment where anything the government gives out is considered "largesse" which the private entrepreneur has to consider himself lucky to get at all. This has led them to believe that since beggars can't be choosers, private entrepreneurs should either take it or leave it. Therefore, the junior engineer actually sees nothing wrong in offering another plot instead of the one that was promised to Alok. <BR>&nbsp; Alok's experience shows how Indian entrepreneurs have to take on an additional management burden called "managing the hassle factor". It is important to get to the root cause of this hassle factor.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5><A target="_parent" class=punch>Resources for development are more efficiently deployed if the government acts as a catalyst and regulator, and not as an executor</A></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>In the past, entrepreneurs had learnt to be prepared for hassles like undeveloped land sites, no sewerage and other problems. But now, with the top echelons of government promoting their states as havens of entrepreneurship, the expectations of entrepreneurs are much higher. Unfortunately no one has seen the need to sensitise the lower operating rungs of the government on the need for change. Hence the issue boils down to one of training. <BR>&nbsp; The pity is that although the top officers constitute less than 2% of the workforce, they get 100% of the training. And we are not talking about sophisticated knowledge-based training sessions, since most government departments have adequate technical knowledge of their areas, but really about awareness sessions -- awareness of the meaning of the role of the government as a catalyst.<BR>&nbsp; To illustrate, if 1-2% of all budgets for development programmes are earmarked for half-a-day or one-day sessions of awareness training for the operating officers of the relevant government departments in that area, each junior engineer -- whether in the electricity department or in the sewerage department -- will see himself as a catalyst of economic development, thereby ushering in change necessary to support government programmes. This is precisely what Raghav has highlighted, though in his exasperation. The content of the awareness programmes should focus on selling the benefits of local development to the local people (perhaps a job opportunity for the junior engineer's son tomorrow!)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="69%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; Just bridging this training gap will go a long way in converting the state and central governments -- and their laid-back bureaucracies -- into entrepreneurs which can propel this country to the forefront of economic well-being. <BR>&nbsp; It is perhaps wishful thinking to hope that to set up a hotel, Alok will not have to deal with 15-20 different authorities -- it happens even in developed countries. But if the operative officers of each of the departments are on the same wavelength as him, the task seems almost like a single window approach to the entrepreneur.<BR>&nbsp; Another relevant issue in most governments is the issue of the senior officers' (IAS) tenure. Since transfers are frequent, even if officers get down to the task of orienting their departments to be customer service oriented, they are transferred within a year or two.&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; The resultant change disrupts the process of change management. By the time the new incumbent settles in, it's time for him to move too.</TD>
<TD width="31%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\55.GIF"> </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; The need is not so much to reorganise governments' structure as to ensure that heads of relevant departments have long enough tenures to be accountable for their departments' actions. And accountability is the cornerstone of running any entrepreneurial organisation. <BR>&nbsp; Alok Aggarwal can practically decide which state to invest in on the basis of one simple rule. How long does an average IAS officer stay in his position? The longer he stays, the more responsive his department. <BR>&nbsp; Alok need not be disheartened. He needs to recognise that change in the government is not going to happen by internal processes alone. Alok himself can, as an entrepreneur, push the change process through by evolving a government management strategy. If he allows himself to be a tool with which Sanat and his friends can change governments, he will reap the benefits of being a pioneer. <BR>&nbsp; Alok has to realise that in the Indian context, a bit of the `frontier spirit' that made America great in the last century is still a key success factor in business. This is his opportunity to display the same spirit.</TD></TR>

<TD width="94%" colSpan=4><A target="_parent" class=punch>Panleaf, a multinational in household hygiene and coloured cosmetics, found that succeeding in the Indian market wasn`t easy as it thought..</A></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="94%" colSpan=4>&nbsp; ANAND Rai examined the charts he had drawn up. A variety of graphs and bar charts were spread out on his desk, plotting growth, volumes, seasonal trends, marketshares and profitability in India, China and eastern Europe.&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; The trend was clear -- but for eastern Europe and some parts of China, PanLeaf Inc's performance had been dismal.Rai was the director, market operations, Asia-Pacific Region, of PanLeaf, a multinational in household hygiene and coloured cosmetics. He was currently on a troubleshooting mission to India to examine and review the state of PanLeaf's operations, as part of his new markets audit. <BR>&nbsp; Traditionally a household products company, PanLeaf had carved a comfortable niche for itself in Europe and the US until its position was threatened and diluted in the early eighties. By the mid-eighties, PanLeaf had realigned its business focus, fine-tuned its product portfolio in household care and also rejuvenated its coloured cosmetics businesses. <BR>&nbsp; Until then, its cosmetics business had been tiny but had showed a lot of promise. PanLeaf brought in the best consultants and went on an acquisition spree on their advice, collecting some 18 cosmetic brands all over the world. That gave its cosmetics business the much-needed shot in the arm. <BR>&nbsp; PanLeaf now wanted to also expand geographically since its interests were largely in the US and Europe and the company's management did not believe that was sustainable. They believed that the 300 million-strong Indian middle class could be leveraged for mass-market products and if they developed a good cosmetics business they could develop a good portfolio at the mass level which could be leveraged anywhere in the world. <BR>&nbsp; There were two possibilities in India: household care or skin care and coloured cosmetics. The international board strongly mooted the fragrances idea, since research showed this market was virtually untouched and global brands had a far greater possibility of succeeding.&nbsp;&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="75%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; The Indian operation was headed by Jim Kura, a Korean with vast experience in new market development. Kura quickly built a sound sales and marketing team, drawn from Indian companies with strong distribution skills. PanLeaf did not want an Indian heading strategy and decision-making, a strategy it had stayed with everywhere else in the world. Kura spent six months studying the market before he rejected the international board's idea of entering the detergents market, despite the consultants' advice which said "...the detergent market is very large, over 20 times the size of the cosmetics market... it is possible to build a strong niche in a large market with speciality detergents like top-end laundry detergent, stain removers and hard surface cleaners." </TD>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="25%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\58.GIF"></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; "No, we cannot take on Procter &amp; Gamble or Unilever," Kura had said. "Though the market is large it will be difficult to set up a company from scratch, given the intensive distribution required and the huge entry cost required to create a reasonable base of production, logistics and sales." <BR>&nbsp; Instead, Kura pushed for an entry into skin care, which seemed more viable to him given that there were just two national organised players in the Indian market. But he rejected an entry into coloured cosmetics. "Skin care products are relatively easier to produce and manage than nail polishes and lipsticks where the range is large and dynamic," he had said.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; But the parent company was more keen on launching colour cosmetics before expanding to skin care, as research had indicated that other than one large organised player, Lakme, colour cosmetics in India were produced largely in the unorganised sector. "The scope for market growth and expansion is high," went the logic. "With the lowering of excise duties and the consumer's preference for organised sector brands, there was scope to build a new brand. In any case, consumers are known to experiment with a variety of global brands bought on visits abroad or from the local grey market. Lastly, of course, the brand awareness of PanLeaf is already high in India," it said. <BR>&nbsp; Kura, who until then was preparing for an entry into the mass market, now had to shift gear to the premium end where PanLeaf's coloured cosmetics were positioned. Even as he went about creating the organisation structure, the international board declared: "We will budget for some losses in year one and two, but we must break even in year three."</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; By this time Kura decided to create a company-owned distribution setup, because brand focus in retail could not be sustained otherwise. The teams were put in place and so was the distribution network, across major and mini metros.&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; PanLeaf then launched three colour cosmetics products -- nail varnishes, lipsticks and eye make-up. They were engineered to suit a variety of cultures and climates. A vegetable extract in lipsticks helped to maintain the correct moisture level and protected lips from ultraviolet rays. They were also smear-proof, long-lasting and hypollergenic-certified -- attributes which had developed a huge consumer following for PanLeaf in most markets. Likewise, the nail varnishes were chip-resistant with built-in nail strengtheners. With such product benefits, the nascent Indian market will boom, since the attitude of Indian women to grooming and appearance had evolved a lot, it felt. <BR>&nbsp; The marketing team conducted a series of pre-launch blind product tests in many cities. It was found that the consumer rated the PanLeaf sample very highly and was even willing to pay a premium of 25-50% over her current brand. Encouraged by the evaluation, the company went ahead with its plans.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5><A target="_parent" class=punch>When coloured cosmetics failed to take off in the indian market, panleaf's brass decided to go into skin care and fragrances, but eventually discovered that even these didn't show much promise</A></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;&nbsp;But when it finally developed the products, PanLeaf found that they were two times more expensive than those offered by its closest competitor, Lakme. PanLeaf, which was hoping to take a 15-20% share of the market in volume terms, now suddenly faced a pricing dilemma. On the one hand it expected to sell its products at a price premium of 50-75%, yet on the other, it needed high contribution to support marketing costs. A lower price would lead to higher volumes, but that would upset its break-even calculations.<BR>&nbsp; Kura had watched the launch of newer brands like Revlon and Oriflame and new launches from Lakme. He also had as benchmarks other fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) in the Indian market, specifically in foods. He was reassured by the presence of a discerning class, which would pay a premium price for superior quality and product performance. <BR>&nbsp; But when the coloured cosmetic products were launched, the initial trial purchases were very good but repeat purchases were very low. Though they were satisfied with the product, consumers found the lipsticks and nail varnishes not offering enough value for money. PanLeaf quickly went back to the research table and assessed the consumer feedback. It found that the consumer felt that the brand's value was almost as high as that of the Indian brand, Lakme. Whenever they put a Lakme product in a non-Lakme packaging, that product scored low. But when they took a better product from the market and put it into Lakme packaging, it was rated high. So there was a score which the consumer was willing to give Lakme which she didn't give to any other product. PanLeaf came close to Lakme; just its product delivery and positioning, it seemed, was strong enough to take Lakme head-on. But the trouble was that it was two times more expensive. The consumer was satisfied with the product quality, but she was not willing to pay a price which was twice that of Lakme's for it. <BR>&nbsp; Kura went back to the drawing board, and ran a fine tooth comb over his costs. But the international board reiterated its averseness to lowering the prices, for that meant a squeeze on margins and a delay in breaking even.<BR>&nbsp; Besides, a lower price also meant that that Kura would have to sell 20 times as much, and he wasn't sure if there was enough demand to justify such volumes. Then again, when he went back and studied the research findings he wasn't sure if a small drop in price was going to shift consumer loyalty too much. He felt the consumer expected imagery and variety in nail varnishes and lipsticks rather than safety, durability and protection. Maybe Lakme was safe and all that, but those were not the attributes on which it was positioned. For instance, Lakme was not saying 'good company, sound brands', which the consumer knew anyway, but was saying `we will make you beautiful...' and that was what the consumer was paying for. Kura could see that Lakme met her expectations, so she had no reason to pay twice as much for a brand that was also global.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="20%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\59.GIF"></TD>
<TD width="80%" colSpan=3>&nbsp;Naturally, for PanLeaf's attributes to gain consumer saliency, it required huge investments in need-building, awareness and habit development. It was therefore clear it would be difficult to break even in three years. Lowering the price and pitching for volumes was against the company philosophy as it would lead to sustained marketing costs. <BR>&nbsp; It was then that Fred Miller, the corporate marketing man in PanLeaf International, decided to restate the India strategy. He now suggested launching the premium range of skin care products and fragrances. "The current distribution setup is capable of leveraging a limited premium range across coloured cosmetics, skin care and fragrances," he said.&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; "Your incremental costs will be just the launch phase, but your consumer set is the same for all three categories. By adding width to your portfolio you will get a bigger bang for your buck as your costs will now be borne by a wider portfolio, and this will heighten brand interest." &nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp; Extending that logic, the international board suggested that PanLeaf India launch a series of speciality skin care products -- peel-off masks, day creams with vegetable ceramides and enzymes and skin exfoliators. Even if these were more expensive, the research finding was that consumers were less price-sensitive to speciality performance products. Kura had seen that in the performance of Complex, a recent entrant in the Indian market. A global brand too, its speciality skin care products were faring well while its mass products were not. <BR>&nbsp; So within eight months Kura brought in Panleaf's Plus range of treatment products, preceded by a huge ad splurge. The market got off to a good start. But soon after, the offtakes dipped sharply. <BR>&nbsp; More research and analysis followed. PanLeaf India discovered that the positioning and the imagery needed for a skin care range were vastly different from those for coloured cosmetics. Skin care was serious, technology and testimony-driven; coloured cosmetics were about fun, beauty and fashion. PanLeaf had assumed that a consumer would respond to the umbrella brand `PanLeaf', that the umbrella brand would sell, and other than launch costs the only things needed were to build awareness and trial for the skin care range. But in reality, awareness and trial did not build up.<BR>&nbsp; Around the same time PanLeaf kicked off its fragrance business too, to leverage its premium image. Kura had been wary of entering fragrances. Skin care was not new to Indian usage habits, but as far as fragrances went, he had noticed, even the deodorant habit did not exist in India. Perfumes were associated with expensive occasions and locations, and were not a part of the daily dressing habit. Given the climate, it was talcum powder that was most used. To upgrade such a consumer to deodorants or perfumes required habit development, Kura felt. <BR>&nbsp; Then again, if PanLeaf entered fragrances, it had to do so with many variants, for a consumer would demand a battery of fragrances to choose from, not just a lavender or a musk. "The entry into fragrances cannot and should not be arbitrary," he had warned. "This is a country where the usage habit for perfumes is at a nascent stage. We must research usage habits and needs and launch the appropriate fragrances," he had said.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5><A target="_parent" class=punch>After trying all the combinations, Rai felt that the products could be profitable if there were no advertising costs. Could direct marketing help in reversing the company's fortunes?</A></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Even so, PanLeaf India went ahead and launched four varieties of deodorants and perfumes. Pushed into accepting fragrances in his portfolio, Kura manoeuvered the launch of talcum powders, which were adaptations of their deodorants. Fred resisted, for nowhere in the world did PanLeaf market talcum powders. So why in India, he asked. But Kura bullied his way through. His maverick ploy did not have the blessing of his bosses, nor did he get global assistance on product development, since talcum powder was not part of the global stable. Kura then priced his talcs at only a 20% premium over the market, defying the internal contribution requirement. <BR>&nbsp; Three months after the launch, PanLeaf found that retailers had a huge stock of unsold deodorants. The talcum range had medium levels of trial, but repeat purchases were high. From a sales perspective, it could be said that the volumes existed but given the pricing there was hardly any contribution left!&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="100%" colSpan=5>
<P align=left>&nbsp; End-1998, when Kura looked at the performance of the speciality skin care range and the fragrances, he could see that neither held promise. And that was what he told Rai in Singapore. "Whether it is cosmetics or skin care, it is about researching and understanding consumer habits and usage, and then about habit development. But in India the consumer is not upgrading. The attitude continues to be `mass' and low price. She is not looking for long-lasting lipstick, or ultraviolet protection for lips," said Kura. "That will require investments in habit and market development, which means higher breakeven levels. Secondly, the imagery in colour, skin and fragrances is so different that each category will require its own investment."<BR>&nbsp; But PanLeaf India did not have that kind of spending stamina, emotional readiness or the encouragement of its parent which had set its sights on a three-year breakeven period. "We came into the country thinking there were 300 million consumers, but the fact is that there aren't so many consumers -- at least not at the prices at which we are selling. We are neither in a position to lower prices nor are we investing in market development," Kura had said abjectly. <BR>&nbsp; Rai, who had been called in to sort out the problems in India, heard out Kura's woes. "Naturally, the local management team was at a loss to make the operations viable," continued Kura. "Every product it wanted launched or developed straightaway meant investments in market development. The corporate marketing team in head office would not make a commitment or decide. The business plans that were drawn out were not implemented. When the company is new and you want to break even in so short a time, how can I develop resilience?" asked Kura. <BR>&nbsp; Yet at the same time, new entrants like Complex had demystified the high price myth, felt Rai. "Naturally," said Kura. "Complex was less concerned about breaking even than with getting the brand accepted. "The singular roadblock we faced was the dictat of early breakeven periods. And it was amazing, because we were not the only new boys sitting in India. Every other FMCG category -- be it shoes, cola or cereal -- was similarly tackling costs and breakevens and providing for start-up losses or non-profits," he said. </P></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="75%" colSpan=3>Now as he studied the charts before him, Rai was intrigued by the emerging patterns. PanLeaf's approach had been the same in China, eastern Europe and India. It had came to the eastern European markets around the same time it entered India. Yet, eastern Europe was profitable from year one. In eastern Europe, the prices that consumers were willing to pay for products were almost similar to those in the western world. Skin care products in the European world were priced anywhere between $5 and $10. Even when eastern Europe was part of the Soviet Bloc, it was influenced by the goods and services in western Europe. When these countries became independent, the first thing they did was to allow imports. </TD>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="25%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\60.GIF"> </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Naturally, when we launched in eastern Europe, we were amongst the first few to grab consumer attention by spending money on ad support, thought Rai. We had innumerable product ranges and variants to choose from. The prices quoted were high, ad support high, and in the first year we were successful. <BR>&nbsp; But PanLeaf had met with minimum success in China and India. It took the company five years to succeed in China, but that was because of the takeover of another large local cosmetic brand. And that struck Rai as unique: it seemed to do well wherever it acquired new brands. Taking on an ongoing business always gives you the energy to build it and take it forward. Even historically, the rapid growth that it saw in its first 10 years was due to acquisitions. Creating new brands in new markets would take a long time -- it would mean changing habits, building brand saliency and growing the market. <BR>&nbsp; Rai ran a tired hand over his unshaven jaw. The approach of trying to get price and contribution did not work, he thought. Or, our managerial style and marketing strategy which had worked for us worldwide did not work in developing countries, he mused. Or, we had no decisive, well-formulated category entry strategy for India. Or, should we have tackled the mass market before the premium segment, he wondered. <BR>&nbsp; Rai tossed the issues over and over in his mind. Exiting India was just not acceptable to him. It was a good market, of course. The margins were healthy, but the volumes PanLeaf sold were not enough to generate healthy contributions that would support advertising in Indian markets. If there was no advertising, the business would be very successful at whatever volumes it could get, he felt. And the only way you could operate without advertising was direct marketing. Mass advertising worked if volumes were large. PanLeaf needed to break even quickly and the volumes were simply not there. <BR>&nbsp; The direct marketing idea grabbed Rai. In the last three years they had altered a lot across product categories. None of these had worked. Should he give India one more chance and invest in direct marketing, he wondered. </TD></TR>

<P>THIS case made excellent reading. It reminded me of Gulliver's Travels, where the Giant lay helpless among the Lilliputians. In fact, it reminded me of all the stories that I have read about the follies and foibles of the unsuspecting foreigner who arrives lured by the magic of the Orient, only to find a maze of minefields and swamps, inhabited by the barbarians and the heathen. What is he to do now? Where is the glass slipper that can make up for the horrific discovery, at the midnight hour when strategy turns to implementation, that the coaches were actually pumpkins and footmen lizards?</P></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>This case tempts one to take each decision made by the PanLeaf team and analyse where it went wrong and how it could have avoided the mistakes -- be it in assessing the size of the consumer base, or in resolving the "mass or class" dilemma, or in understanding the power of the grey market, or appreciating the cultural aspects that inhibit the use of make-up or deodorants. Most of these answers are by now wellknown, and I would like to address a more fundamental question: why do companies make such mistakes? <BR>&nbsp; The Indian market has now seen enough PanLeafs to know that the brightest and the best fall prey to the Emerging Market Disease. Why do they succumb? It definitely isn't because of a lack of market understanding skills. Or poor strategic thinking. Or an inability to innovate products to suit country-specific needs. They often have a formidable reputation of doing all this in their home markets.<BR>&nbsp; My hypothesis is that this happens because of the mindset with which multinational companies approach new markets, particularly emerging ones, which makes them very vulnerable. I would like to discuss three manifestations of this mindset -- discovery-inhibiting mental models of the market, value arrogance and a lack of alignment of the head, the heart and the purse. Let me illustrate all of them with reference to PanLeaf. <BR>&nbsp; There appear to be some dominant mental models about the Indian market, all of which have proved to be hazardous in different cases.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5><A target="_parent" class=punch>The indian market has now seen enough panleafs to know that the brightest and best seem to fall prey to the emerging market disease&nbsp;</A></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5><STRONG>&nbsp; Mental Model 1</STRONG>: "Just like somewhere else". In this model, the assumption is that the market is "exactly like the US was 20 years ago", or "If it worked in Thailand and Mexico and Vietnam, it will work here". This makes the marketer skip a very important stage -- developing a fundamental understanding of the market. The notion that developing markets are like baby developed markets or that differing stages of evolution mapped by per capita gross domestic product is the great leveller is patently incorrect. <BR><STRONG>&nbsp; Mental Model 2:</STRONG> It is just a question of numbers. It is. But this is how it works. Not as in "if every Indian woman consumed one lipstick, one eye-liner and one bottle of perfume every year..." But as in "affordability limits the market to this number. Accessibility to this number. And acceptability by this number." <BR><STRONG>&nbsp; Mental Model 3</STRONG>: "Who can resist progress? People don't know what they don't know -- all we need to do is show them." But what is aspirational in their cultural lexicon? Being able to have a cool shower in running water twice a day or using deodorant twice a day? Having glowing skin or sporting a splash of colour? A good hard look at Hindi films would answer that question. <BR><STRONG>&nbsp; Mental Model 4:</STRONG> "Ready for my global strategy? Gosh this is really underdeveloped -- I'll just come back in 10 years." I guess the basic question is: "Do you want to be a shaper? Or merely an adapter?" The answer to this depends on the pain and the gain of doing each. PanLeaf has subscribed to all these mental models at some time or another -- perhaps it diminished its need to take a good hard zero-based look at the market.&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="74%" colSpan=4>&nbsp;Value arrogance is a deadly sin that many new entrants seem to fall prey to. Value, as the case points out, is the net effect of benefit minus price. That consumers pick the best value offering is universally true, whether they are in Poland or in Pune. <BR>&nbsp;However, how this value is processed is different across different cultures. Hypoallergenic and protection from ultraviolet rays are nice things to have -- but are they hugely valuable benefits? What proportion of Indian skins are as sensitive as European ones? What are the cultural labels of cosmetics? And where do they stand in the wish-list hierarchy of the Indian woman? PanLeaf, if it hadn't been value-arrogant, would have started from scratch to discover how value for its products is processed in this country.</TD>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="25%"><IMG SRC="my project_images\62.GIF"></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Its research would have yielded better results, since it would have done some naive consumer listening to begin with. <BR>&nbsp; Another side effect of a blinkered mindset at PanLeaf seems to have been that even fundamental assumptions that formed the pillars of strategy like "who uses what -- the same people or different people, and why" were not tested out. The questioning seemed to be a bit in the realm of "would you like a holiday in the Bahamas?" Who doesn't? <BR>&nbsp; Finally, the only way to win in an emerging market is for the Head, the Heart and the Purse to be in perfect alignment. What happened at PanLeaf was that the head was looking at developing a new market as a mega growth opportunity of the kind that no developed market could offer. The heart was however unwilling to accept that best practice in developed markets must give way to next practice in emerging markets. And the purse was unwilling to support what was needed for market development and learning a whole new game. <BR>&nbsp; As C.K. Prahalad said in a recent Harvard Business Review article, multinationals may change emerging markets forever -- but the reverse is also true.</TD></TR>

<P>&nbsp; THE case of PanLeaf highlights several interesting things. It presents essential attributes of the Indian market in the context of a multinational brand, while at the same time underlining the need for strategic common sense. It drives home the fact that while chalk is very different from cheese, both have a market. <BR>&nbsp; PanLeaf had the right corporate credentials: it was an acknowledged international brand, synonymous with home care and cosmetics. Over the years, it had acquired as many as 18 cosmetics brands from around the world and reinforced its status as a major cosmetics player.&nbsp;</P></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; &nbsp; While India was new to PanLeaf, PanLeaf was not new to the Indian consumer. In the cosmetics segment, the brand awareness of PanLeaf was already high in India.<BR>&nbsp; But PanLeaf read India wrong, and that was its undoing. It believed that the 300 million consumer base of the Indian middle class could be leveraged for mass market products. It was naive to see this 300 million as one homogeneous whole: it actually has several layers, sets and subsets, each defined by its own peculiarities of spending power, 'value for money' notions and consumption habits. The Indian consumer wants a quality product, but does not want to pay premium prices for it. This is the paradox most marketers face. PanLeaf was never able to balance this equation.<BR>&nbsp; The selection of a foreigner who did not have an adequate understanding or appreciation of the Indian market as country head compromised PanLeaf. Not only did Jim Kura lack knowledge about the market's nuances, he didn't have much influence at the company's headquarters too. One weakness was bad enough; two spelled disaster. <BR>&nbsp; What surprises me is that while PanLeaf undertook research, it did not abide by its recommendations. We know that market research favoured the introduction of home care products (detergents), and promised space at the top end of the market. Jim Kura's U-turn from home care (detergents) and into skin care seems to be whimsical rather than based on facts. He turned away from detergents due to the presence of two major market players. Deciding a marketing venture purely on the basis of the number of players is naive. <BR>&nbsp; </TD></TR>

<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;&nbsp; With its core competency and implied quality in detergents, PanLeaf could have carved a niche at the premium end. But it abandoned this tack.<BR>&nbsp; Another serious lacuna was PanLeaf's habit of not making consistent decisions. Like detergents, it planned to move into skin care, but abandoned it in favour of cosmetics. Nevertheless, the cosmetics segment could have been exploited successfully. PanLeaf had a well-formulated category strategy in cosmetics. The premium cosmetic products market was small, but fast expanding. There was no major established player in this market and the nearest competitor was not positioned as a premium brand; it was a "good brand at a fair price", leaving the premium end unexploited. PanLeaf also had global competencies in premium cosmetics brands. This meant that it had an advantage over other Indian players in terms of technology. The local Indian brand was the only serious competitor in the organised sector. PanLeaf had a high degree of brand recall in India for cosmetics. It owned several global brands too, and had a core competency in the segment. The three colour cosmetics PanLeaf launched in the country rested on solid ground. They were technically researched, and had USPs: lipsticks which maintained the correct moisture levels and protected lips from ultraviolet rays, chip-resistant nail varnishes and so on. The competitors' products had none of these attributes.&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="75%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; PanLeaf gave up on cosmetics too easily. &nbsp;The move into skin care was unwise. As was clubbing cosmetics and skin care products under an umbrella brand. This led to a diffusion of brand personality and took away the distinction between the two. Like everything else that PanLeaf did in India, it was more of a knee-jerk reaction rather than a studied decision. The market responded initially, but in a country with an age-old system of skin care treatments, popular in every home, skin care was not a hot proposition.&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; The addition of fragrances was not prudent either. Consumers see fragrances to be for occasional use, slightly flippant, and definitely expensive.</TD>

<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;&nbsp; No wonder they did not take off. His hunch on talcum powder paid off: repeat purchases were high. But progress in this case also was doomed by the now characteristic impulsive and inconsistent style of PanLeaf India. <BR>&nbsp; At the end of the day, Rai was called to fire-fight. "We have tried everything else and nothing has worked, so we might as well consider direct selling." But if the products are rejected by the market, direct selling will not help. PanLeaf believes that it can save on advertising and promotion costs by selling directly, but it is ignoring the hidden costs of a direct selling operation. Direct selling calls for strong competencies, global or local. PanLeaf doesn't have these. Direct selling depends on a strong relationship with distributors/members. It is a dual exercise: core marketing for brand building, and relationship marketing for a strong relationship with distributors/members. It takes years to acquire these. Direct selling also involves significant investments in IS/IT systems. <BR>&nbsp; PanLeaf has already made massive investments in its distribution setup (retail model). It should focus on retail, but limit its presence to major markets/stores which cater to the high-end consumer. But before it does that, PanLeaf must take a long, hard look at its basic failures and rectify them. It must develop long-term, well thought out strategies in sync with market nuances. Above all, it must adapt to India. And adapt imaginatively, with patience.</TD></TR>

<TR>
<TD width="92%" colSpan=4>&nbsp; GANGADHARAN Raman studied the headlines in the business section of a daily: "Richmond India undisputed number one... unbeaten record..." he read out aloud, as he looked across at his son.&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Sundar, who was ploughing through a bowl full of boiled peas and a shoulder-high pile of newspapers, waved his head -- half in rhythm with the beats of Umayalpuram's mridangam wafting from the music system and half in proud acknowledgement of his company's continued spectacular performance.<BR>&nbsp; Sundar was the country manager of Richmond India whose performance reports were covered by every newspaper. "Richmond India will always fly high; its systems are engineered to deliver only success," he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; "You know," said Raman, "attaining success is one thing, but staying successful is a different matter altogether."<BR>&nbsp; "Appa, we have stayed at the top for six years now. That's no mean achievement. It also means that we have worked at sustaining the leadership position," said Sundar. <BR>&nbsp; But the senior Raman had a different viewpoint. "It is when you are tremendously successful that you should stop and take stock of your environment. You must examine the success factors and study what you can do differently now, what others are learning to do differently and, therefore, what you need to do even better than them," elaborated Raman.<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; Noticing the tenor of his father's voice, Sundar asked: "You think somebody will pull the rug from under our feet?" <BR>&nbsp; "It's not entirely impossible, you know," said Raman, folding the newspaper. "It has happened to so many companies in the past. Why shouldn't it happen to Richmond?" <BR>&nbsp; "We are a cautious and conservative company, Appa, not one looking for a quick buck on an Indian tour," said Sundar. <BR>&nbsp; "Neither was Hindustan Lever Ltd (HLL)," pointed Raman. "It rode high with Surf, believing in its invincibility, until Nirma challenged its marketing wisdom. Nor Coca-Cola. In its 95th year, even as it stood tall in the soft drinks market, a virtual Goliath, Coke took its invincibility for granted and launched New Coke. The crash can still be heard." <BR>&nbsp; "These are rare marketing occurrences, Appa," Sundar replied. But Raman had more examples. "Take Society Tea. It stormed into the market in 1991 and within four years cornered 30% of the packaged tea market in Mumbai, overcoming Red Label, to assume the No.1 slot. HLL is also a cautious, conservative company, but Nirma and Society happened to it. The examples are many, Sundar. Robin Blue challenged by Ujala, Stayfree taken on by Whisper, Colgate by Close-up, Cadbury by Nestle... Each is a setback of a different kind, but at the core, it is all about a leader who underestimated his turf." </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="75%" colSpan=3>&nbsp;"What about your own company?" asked Sundar. "After keeping an iron grip on the market for 30 years, you lost out to Delite in one year! Wasn't that complacency?" <BR>&nbsp; There was a pained expression on the senior Raman's face. Two years ago, he had retired from Tarmann India where he was a sales manager. "Tarmann's story is not about complacency," he said. "What happened to Tarmann was because of time, circumstances, evolution and mindsets in transition.<BR>&nbsp; "In the late sixties, Tarmann was a single-product company that relied heavily on its moneyspinner, Solo.&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;In 1977 when the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (Fera) forced multinationals to dilute their stakes in their subsidiaries, the British parent company lost interest in India and whatever little investment was being made in Solo also stopped. </TD>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="25%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\67.GIF"></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; The parent company now focused more on getting a healthy dividend for its residual stake. Naturally, the Indian subsidiary concentrated on profits rather than market growth and sales. In any case, those days there was hardly any competition in Solo's product category. <BR>&nbsp; "The Indian managing director, Prabhu Pal, who took over the reins, had a tough brief: make good profits and declare the highest return on capital in the region. There was a trade-off between capitalising on emerging opportunities and being an exceptionally profitable organisation. Tarmann chose profits. <BR>&nbsp; "Tarmann's share prices were five-six times those of other multinationals during that era. The company's market capitalistation was the highest in the stockmarket, and it was paying dividends of 70-80%. Everybody thought Tarmann was doing very well, and soon the management also believed that the brands could survive without new investments. <BR>&nbsp; "A chicken and egg situation followed. Post-dilution, Tarmann India had entered new product categories like basic skin care, creams and talcum powder. Even as these products took off in a market that was starved of variety, rather than invest in these growth products, the approach was: milk them for profits. Naturally, their performance dropped. <BR>&nbsp; "Then there were some glitches," went on Raman. "In the early eighties, Great India Products launched Shine, which competed directly with Solo. It nipped off marketshares here and there, but Tarmann had tremendous distribution strength, which helped. It sustained such a large distribution network on Solo alone, can you imagine? It says a lot. Companies with a portfolio of 10 products could not sustain those levels. <BR>&nbsp; "But no investments were forthcoming. The unwritten strategy was one of low fixed investments and low advertising support -- the advertising to sales ratio (A:S) was only two! Despite all that, sales boomed and the product was in perennial short supply. <BR>&nbsp; "Pal's overall approach was low-cost management. Wherever he could, he cut costs and that went for advertising too," said Raman. Sundar was taken aback. <BR>&nbsp; "Look at it from Pal's viewpoint and situation then," explained Raman. "He was running a company whose sales were growing by 15-20% annually. Its product was in short supply. So he felt no need to invest in advertising or promotion. And there was no serious competition! Geckman's Spark was not making any waves. There was MabelWhite which didn't do much. Then there was Brite from Delite Products, sitting somewhere on the shelves, not making any great moves. In the early eighties Delite brought in another new brand, Beam, which floundered, withdrew it, launched another, Glow, which met the same fate... Where was the incentive for Pal to change the way he was doing things?&nbsp;&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="20%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\68.GIF"></TD>
<TD width="80%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; "In any case, despite the low support from the parent company, Tarmann India's skin care category was faring well. Pal was setting the phase for the company within the philosophy of no investments behind the brands, because he was getting sales growth anyway.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Solo was in short supply! We sales managers were taught to manage shortages. We did not have to mess with supply chain management, logistics, nothing. We only had to master allocation! <BR>&nbsp; "Around that time we began to build capacities to increase production. Then something unique happened. Beam was reintroduced, and this time met with unexpected success when it was testmarketed in Tamil Nadu. Much to our surprise, Delite also relaunched Glow, which didn't do too badly either." <BR>&nbsp; "Yet, your management decided to do nothing, why? There must have been some flaw in its thinking!" said Sundar.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; "No, it wasn't a flaw," corrected Raman. "Its thinking was influenced by what had happened until then and what was happening. A Beam from Delite did not mean Tarmann was going to close down. In any case, Delite was small, and this was not the first time it was flirting with the category. It had done so four times in the past, and none of those attempts had borne fruit. The relaunch of Beam this time too did not come as earth-shattering news. It was not any different from the earlier launches. Where was the cause for panic or even anxiety? <BR>&nbsp; "It is very easy to blame the management for what happened. The fact is, Pal was so successful. Success does make you myopic. HLL itself got its first shakeup with Nirma, another upstart like Delite. And it took the company five years to wake up to the truth. Beam was the big event which had to happen to Tarmann. Every successful organisation goes through one trauma in the market and comes face to face with the vividness of its `emperor's new clothes' world view of life.&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; "For an organisation, managing that trauma is tough. The fact is, you have to accept the trauma. Those who had been there in the past also had to battle the old reality. They were present during that phase of rationalisation during which they declared: `Delite is not a big threat... we don't need to invest in advertising...' Now the very same people had to go back to the parent company and say: `But all that was wrong.. Actually, Delite is posing a threat. Then I told you it was all right, now I am saying it was all wrong..." <BR>&nbsp; "It's not easy doing that, believe me. It is devastating. At one level Solo's sustained success seemed too good to be true. And even in those days when the best management advice came only from a Drucker, one looked for `ifs and buts' that would dampen runaway success. There weren't any. But on another level, there were all those reasons for its continued success -- failed competitive efforts, booming growth, no need for advertising, a distribution system that was effective, a market that was in perpetual shortage.... Clearly, it was foolish to put money into areas that were simply not required by the market. <BR>&nbsp; "The other issue was: the organisation hadn't been used to getting kicked around in the marketplace. I do believe that every organisation must periodically get kicked in the pants by circumstances or competition if it wants to stay successful. When you have a proud set of sales managers who have never faced trauma, who have never failed to meet targets even for a single week, who have never once been rejected by the consumer, it is time to create artificial anxiety. They never had to face the following kind of arithmetic: 'Out of every 10 units bought in the market, six are yours, three are his and one is hers. What are you doing to increase that six to seven or nine?' It never happened, not even once in 30 years! <BR>&nbsp;"And this was exactly the kind of market Tarmann India was entering. And suddenly the problems were manifold. Suddenly, everything began to fall apart. A plant we had acquired at a very high price turned out to be unsuitable. The skin cream segment started floundering because of a war between the number one and the number two brands in the category.&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="75%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; Since Tarmann had not invested much in the brand, skin care got annihilated by the war next door.&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp; "The sins of the past were now visiting us. The market reality was: our core category was under threat, the only capacity investments we made had gone wrong. Worse, we were in the midst of a war between our competitors in skin care and just when we needed to throw money into our creams, we found that we needed those funds to defend Solo! So we took a conscious decision to protect our core category, and in the process both the cream and the talcum powder lost marketshare.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; A virtual domino effect followed. The surplus investible funds which we could have got out of our creams and powders were now next to nothing. And with the core category under threat, morale took a beating in another way.</TD>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="25%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\69.GIF"></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Until then we sales people never went to the distributor to sell; goods were simply picked up by them. We interacted with the retailers. Now we had to woo the distributor with schemes and offers, to get them to stock our products. But now he was talking tough. "Where were you the during the past 40 years?" he asked. <BR>&nbsp; "Nothing made sense as Beam picked up marketshare fast. Poor Solo sales two months in a row led to panic. Everyone knew why sales were falling, but it wasn't only because of Beam. It was falling also because we had never learnt how to manage crises, because we had always only trained for managing shortages. Now, when a market was being supplied by a competitor, we didn't know how to sell. <BR>&nbsp; "Meanwhile, the economy was opened, and the parent company upped its stake to 51%. It was now demanding performance, volumes, sales... something it had never done all these years when it was a mere associate. It hadn't considered putting money into the brands, investing in marketing or even getting consumer feedback. From such a situation, the focus shifted from profits to volumes and marketshares and leadership. `We were leaders all along, what happened?' it cried.&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; "Very simply, the system was not geared to a demand-led market. It was not geared to competition, marketing, planning, logistics or supply chain management. The supply chain was not needed. Solo was a shortage product, we didn't need to manage distribution; selling was about allocation, mind you. <BR>&nbsp; "Everything was changing now. You had a parent company which was getting impatient, a market which was getting belligerent, you had skin care products which were getting into skirmishes with the competition, you had a field force which was feeling down and out and a trade which was talking tough. Worse, you had a top management team which was feeling peeved by its own past actions and was now on a witch-hunt.<BR>&nbsp; "It was a tough situation. The local management was finding it difficult to admit that what it had been conjecturing all these years -- 'The market cannot threaten me, I am the strongest, repeated trials by my neighbour will only result in repeated failures, I am invincible' -- was fiction. <BR>&nbsp; "The point is, Pal's corporate upbringing was very different. He believed tremendously in the wisdom of the parent company. Also, the reality around him didn't really point to anything more serious. He was being nurtured and brought up by a parent company which felt that profits were more important.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="20%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\70.GIF"></TD>
<TD width="80%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; "Consequently, related issues like environmental threats and weaknesses were never examined. After all, sales were taking place, and the competition was fumbling.&nbsp;&nbsp; And in the process, Pal never got round to building a strong organisation that was also capable of managing a crisis in the marketplace.<BR>&nbsp; "Frankly that happens only during a crisis. Like I said, every successful company must get a kick in the rear periodically to stay in shape. Why has HLL been able to handle crises so well? Look at its portfolio: it is so vast that at no point in time can it get comfortable with the success of any one division. There is always one division or another falling apart. Naturally, with large portfolios you are constantly moving people around, you build credible human resource systems, and in the process every manager in your stable has been trained in crisis management.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;"HLL has built this through a culture of paranoia. Paranoia is good and important. At its heart is the fear of: `Is there something I am not doing well enough? Is there somebody who is going to do it better?' Which leads to: `What do I need to do better and how do I do it before the guy next door does it?' And that is precisely my advice to you. Paranoia makes you very outward-looking and ever willing to learn. <BR>&nbsp; "So, in the process, we didn't build an organisation. At the end of 30-35 years we found that we had not evolved, because there was no change, no need to change, no threats, not even self- appraisal. We built no marketing skills. So when the crisis came, no one knew what to do. <BR>&nbsp; Even as Beam came in, Pal retired and the technical director, Sukhbir Singh, took over as MD. Now look at what he inherited. Here was a man who had been party to all the decisions made during the tenure of his predecessor. Now he and his generation had to carry the sins of the past and, worse, justify it to the team, and take on the parent company. Not a nice thing to happen. So he looked at operations, plants, beefed up advertising, set up supply chain, logistics and so forth. <BR>&nbsp; "Sukhbir Singh's dictat was to fight competition. And this was a soldier who was there during the quota regime, during the Pal regime; suddenly he was being asked to go to the battlefront and take it in the teeth. I don't think he was mentally prepared for it. But Singh was an exceptionally competent man, very aware and very intelligent. <BR>&nbsp; "Unfortunately, Singh believed it was a sales failure, that it had nothing to do with marketing. But then everybody had their own story and when things are as bad as they were at that point for Tarmann, the buck kept on being passed from here to there. Around the time I retired, he began to bring about changes, but all this was caught in the vicious witch-hunt that continued to plague Tarmann. <BR>&nbsp; "The fact was, the issues were too set to allow for any quantum change to take place. It can improve particular functions, particular competencies, but it certainly is not adequate to bring about quick or urgent changes. <BR>&nbsp; "So you see, Tarmann's story is not about complacency, it's something else. It was a victim of transition -- transition of the economy, of consumer power, of management changes, of economic drivers. And it happened because it was vulnerable, because it depended too much on a single product." <BR>&nbsp; Sundar listened keenly. There was a shadow of complacency now and then in Tarmann's saga, but he reckoned his father had a point too. There were far too many issues which caused the myopia.</TD></TR>

The future of the organisation depends on how well he perceives and handles the situation. His initial response has not been very encouraging.&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;&nbsp; Laying the blame on the sales function for past performance is likely to take Tarmann further on the road to disaster.Singh should instead focus on restoring self-esteem and organisational pride and channeling the energy towards a common goal. <BR>&nbsp; Singh should immediately: <BR>&nbsp; Understand the aspirations of the parent company and agree on realistic, medium and long-term objectives with it.&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Redirect the company's focus from 'managing for profit', to `managing for profitable growth'. <BR>&nbsp; By increasing its stake in the Indian operations, the parent company has now indicated its long-term commitment to the subsidiary.

<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;&nbsp; Tarmann thrived in a period of scarcity, completely disregarding the changing environment. In the post Fera-era and after the dilution of the parent company's stock holding, the subsidiary pulled back even the little investments it was making in its single flagship brand. The company chose to manage the business to earn in an emerging market, oblivious to the huge opportunities. Its portfolio comprised a single low-tech product that was partly outsourced. Its efforts were internally focused, to take the cost out of the system, losing sight of avenues to strengthen its position in the marketplace. It believed that it could launch new categories, and manage them profitably without making any investment. &nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; The company had a big opportunity to develop other product categories such as skin care, given that it had such a great start after they were launched. Over a period of time, it could have emerged as a multi-category company and become stronger to fight competition. Tarmann chose not to build on its competitive strength.&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="75%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; It could have further consolidated its position by segregating the category and introducing appropriate product extensions or another brand at different price points to pre-empt the competition. It failed to anticipate or even react to changes in the marketplace, consumer preferences, technological advancements or regulatory/environmental issues.&nbsp; Despite all the warnings, it failed to counter the entry of competitors in Tamil Nadu. Not only did it under-invest in brands and under-performed vis-a-vis market potential, Tarmann never stretched its systems to deliver to the full potential.&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; At the same time the company invested in building manufacturing capacities for low-technology products and acquired facilities at high prices. While the going was good, it never chose to build a healthy relationship with the trade. In a way it silently watched as the crisis developed, ignoring repeated warnings from the marketplace.</TD>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="25%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\72.GIF"></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;&nbsp; Singh has to build on the strengths of the existing organisation without pinpointing the responsibility on one function or the other. Certainly there will be pockets of incompetence or people who fail to adapt to the changing environment, but Singh needs to set up the challenge, expose the weaknesses of the system or people, and then take remedial action. He may have to bring in change leaders from outside with the right mindset, sense of purpose and urgency. The mandate to its employees was to manage for profit and they did a good job of it by achieving the highest return on investments and earnings per share.Now he has to change gear and work aggressively a growth agenda, building the brand and portfolio, with adequate advertising support. Singh needs to infuse confidence and competitive spirit in his employees, which would be the key to future success. Singh has the equally important task of restoring Tarmann's good relationship with the trade and regaining its confidence in the company. It is quite possible that it may have to rebuild its relationship with other external agencies as well. <BR>&nbsp; A key area of action for Tarmann is the optimisation of product portfolio. Given past experience, Singh probably would not like Tarmann to be a single-product company in future. Singh would do well to research and gain key insights about market trends, demographics and competitive offerings before drawing up marketing plans. <BR>&nbsp; The company needs to invest in Solo and take it back to its leadership position. It should also create a second flank brand to counterattack Beam.</TD></TR>

<TD width="80%" colSpan=3>&nbsp;<B>John Pinto</B> <I>is the chief financial officer of Whirlpool of India and a director on its board for the last two years.<BR><BR></I>&nbsp;THE setting: the quarter-final of the Cricket World Cup 1996. The two opposing teams: South Africa and the West Indies. Pre-match reviews: South Africa is a sure-shot favourite for winning the cup. However, the final result -- mighty South Africa suffer a humiliating defeat. After much deliberation the key issues: complacency and inability to handle pressure.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;South Africa's continuous string of victories created a sense of overconfidence and the West Indies match was regarded as just another regulation match. Another major factor -- the middle order rarely had had a chance to bat at all in previous fixtures and was unaccustomed to pressure situations. The combination of these factors led to inevitable failure. <BR>&nbsp; As in sport, so in business. Tarmann, carried away by unopposed success, became overconfident, complacent and so myopic that it could neither see nor respond to the real competitive threat when it came. Failure to properly address long-term issues in its quest for short-term profits drove Tarmann in a direction it could not easily and quickly reverse, leading eventually to its downfall.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5><A target="_parent" class=punch>Tarmann was too leathargic in waling up to the really and eventually failed to protect its brand equity from attack</A></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Tarmann failed to realise that volumes in the industry were purely attributable to population growth rather than its own initiatives. The company made no effort to proactively grow the category or increase marketshare. Investment in the brand was minuscule and the consumer was taken for granted with no attempt at innovation. Long-term needs were sacrificed to achieve short-term goals. The only reason for the brand's success was the lack of alternatives for the consumer at that time. As soon as a credible alternative appeared in the market, Solo's brand franchise was not strong enough to command adequate consumer loyalty. <BR>&nbsp; A company must constantly be in a state of preparedness to deal with all eventualities. What this means is that a brand must continuously be energised through new, innovative products that excite the consumer and create entry barriers for competitors.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="75%" colSpan=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;And, of course, powerful communication is essential to make the consumer aware of the latest developments. The best time for a company to take these steps is when it is on top because resources, especially cash, are not a constraint. Structural change in all aspects of operation must continuously be pursued even in times of plenty in order to derive quantum benefits. To start thinking about corrective action on the downturn is too expensive, too difficult to implement and much too late to secure management buy-in. Tarmann was too lethargic in waking up to the reality and eventually failed to protect its brand equity from attack by Delite.&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; In addition to a consumer focus, a company must always keep a watchful eye on competitors. Success often leads to arrogance, creating an inward-looking management without an external focus.</TD>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="25%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\74.GIF"></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Tarmann did so by not analysing closely enough what competitors were doing and what lessons could be learned and what remedial action was essential. <BR>&nbsp; All too often, when there is no challenge an organisation can lapse into complacency and not sharpen its skills. It is a key leadership role to keep an organisation in a state of constant "red alert" for the economic equivalent of war -- competition. An organisation which is not continuously challenged from within will not develop the ability to handle external threat. <BR>&nbsp; Tarmann was remiss in doing none of these. When the real threat struck, the organisation was thrown into disarray, internal bickering replaced teamwork and the company was unable to respond as one man to the crisis. <BR>&nbsp; Tarmann is clearly a case of serious leadership failure.</TD></TR>

<TR>
<TD width="98%" colSpan=4><A target="_parent" class=punch>Giridhar Nemani, promoter of loss-making Kellapp Industries, faced a question: can a new chief operaing officer ask for a share of future profits?.</A></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="98%" colSpan=4>&nbsp; Girdhar Nemani watched the hour glass fill with the glitter, drop by drop. When it was done, he turned it around and let it start all over again.&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;He had been at it for the last 45 minutes, while his mind brimmed with the meeting he had just concluded with Adip Rai, partner at headhunter firm Cornwell Search. Rai's recommendation had shaken up his restructuring plans.&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; Nemani was the promoter and managing director of Kellapp Industries, which manufactured an industrial speciality product, Sirrug-32. The product was recently had been deregulated by the Indian government. Due to intense competition at home and surplus capacities in the global market, the last two years had seen unprecedented losses at Kellapp. The company was sound on technology and clued into the global market, but Sirrug-32 was a commodity product range and was affected by global pricing. When he set up his business 15 years ago, little did Nemani realise that it would grow the way it did. 'You can't be in this category and remain small. Success lies in big capacities, volumes and investments,; he told his advisors, Bright &amp; Thakur, which he had hired last year to examine the company's losses. But Nemani was optimistic since the market was huge and the demand for Sirrug-32 variants high. He proposed additional capacities that would take Kellapp's turnover from Rs 1,600 crore to Rs 6,000 crore. <BR>&nbsp; Bright &amp; Thakur's diagnosis was tough on Nemani: Kellapp had not invested in professional management, had suffered from a lack of systems and processes and had mismanaged margins in the international markets. Sirrug-32 was competitive in quality, but quality was not the only determinant. There were other values that Kellapp needed to deliver. <BR>&nbsp; Another grey area was buying. Kellapp's key raw material was also a commodity, so buying was large and speculative. The company did not have a clear positioning for Sirrug-32, or a plan to increase value delivery. ;When you are in industrial products, you are actually a service-led company,; said Bright &amp; Thakur. ;Products require different dimensions of servicing, in packaging, distribution, logistics, availability. It is a customer service-led market and you need strategic business units (SBUs).; </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="81%" colSpan=3>&nbsp;Nemani had agreed, and Bright &amp; Thakur created SBUs under the managing director. Kellapp now needed to hire business heads to manage the business units, since people of the calibre needed to drive the business were not available in-house. ;I am not a professional, I am the owner, I understand the business in the international context, but I do not have the management capability to drive that in the organisational sense. The functional heads are professionals but are not people of the quality to push the business beyond a point. They come from within the industry but the industry itself, if you see how it has evolved, has not harboured quality people.;&nbsp;That was how Nemani hired Cornwell Search, known to have hired the best CEOs in the country. &nbsp; </TD>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="23%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\77.GIF"> </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;&nbsp; Nemani needed two business heads, one of whom he wanted to groom as the managing director. ;I do wish to retire,; Nemani had confided to Adip Puri of Cornwell, ;though that is just a dream and with the business going great guns, I certainly don't see myself being able to spearhead all that. It is time I looked around for a successor, but there is time for that, at least three years, for that is when the capacities come up in full swing.;<BR>&nbsp; But Cornwell did not think three years was enough time. Hiring business heads would only address the short-term mandate of leading the company into a profit situation. The long-term mandate was to build the organisation to manage a growth of Rs 6,000 crore. Rai asked: ;Having hired the business heads, how are you going to move the business forward? The business heads will change the capability of these jobs, and the drive of the other functions. So, let's say you will soon have a well run financial management, marketing management, buying management. But does all this add up to a total organisation which is now to make a quantum leap from Rs 1,600 crore to Rs 6,000 crore? ;<BR>&nbsp; Putting the capacities in place is part of the process, but going out there and developing the market and selling is another. The traditional processes of market development are not going to lead you there. There are some very cutting-edge management issues which I can see will impact the success of your business. And that can happen only if you create a layer in between the managing director and the rest of the organisation today.; <BR>&nbsp; Ideally, as Cornwell saw it, there was a job at the top, above the business and functional heads. A chief operating officer. And that job had to be manned today, not three years hence. ;The business head you hire today has a long way to go,; said Adip. ;First he will have to prove himself on the job, then he will have to prove himself in the managing director's job. And you are talking of a time-frame of 3-4 years, but you don't have that kind of time! The next 3-4 years are very critical. Your capacities will be up and ready by 2001; by that time, the business needs to be of a particular capability to manage those volumes.; <BR>&nbsp; Adip saw a serious issue. The kind of person Kellapp needed as the managing director or even as the COO was not available within the industry, the protected environment had not allowed capabilities to develop. Therefore, such a person would have to be hired from outside the industry and he would be on the learning curve till he learnt the business. <BR>&nbsp; It was a complex situation. Nemani wanted to hire two business heads now, one of whom would move up as the managing director in three years. As far as Cornwell was concerned, the learning curve was a given, wherever the person was hired. But Nemani's plan was sub-optimal, it felt. ;The next three years are very critical for you. A business head hired today will be on the learning curve for 2-3 years, during which period the company is also growing, the capacities are being built and you will need somebody who can pick up the baton and run!; </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="20%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\78.GIF"> </TD>
<TD width="80%" colSpan=3>&nbsp;Nemani now came up with a new plan. ;Let us hire a COO as you suggest, and only one business head. I will rather hire two senior operating persons internally and run the SBU myself than hire a business head. Thus, at the end of three eyars, one of these senior managers moves up as the business head, the COO we hire will become the managing director and I will retire. That structure is very viable. You have done succession planning, you have built the organisational capability and the people's roles are in place.; That agreed on, Adip now brought up compensation. Nemani was willing to pay the business head Rs 35-40 lakh. ;The COO can be paid 25% more. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;&nbsp; How does that sound?; he asked. ;I can't tell you that you cannot hire a COO at Rs 50-60 lakh,; said Adip. ;But what are your expectations of the COO? What capabilities are you seeking? You want him to be a totally different person. He is not a person who is 20% better than the business head, right? Then don't relate the COO's compensation to the business head's. They are entirely different jobs, with different mindsets, approaches and capabilities.; <BR>&nbsp; Three weeks later, Adip placed before Nemani the resume of three stunning candidates for the post of business heads. Nemani was impressed by all of them, each of whom, he felt, had the potential to become the managing director. However, their current compensation was higher than what he was offering for the post of business head. ;If you hire any one of them, understand you will have to pay higher than what you are offering now. Which means between Rs 60-70 lakh,; said Adip. <BR>&nbsp; Nemani shuddered. The amount was far beyond his imagination. If that was the price for a business head, what would a COO cost, he wondered. ;You need to clarify today if you will be prepared to pay what it takes to hire a COO and in our assessment it looks like Rs 1 crore or higher,; said Adip, even as Nemani's jaw dropped. ;You may even find someone at Rs 60 lakh,; said Adip. ;It is possible to find someone who is earning Rs 45 lakh and offer him Rs 60 lakh. But do you want to hire cheap, or do you want to start by putting a value to this COO job? If you want my advice, you might want to hire the person at a lower fixed component today, because you are making losses today -- but you might like to build a large variable component and let him catch up, based on the success of the business and gradually attain the market value of this job. That approach tackles both attractiveness and retention issues,; said Adip. <BR>&nbsp; Nemani was perplexed. At that kind of salary, where was there any doubt about retention? Why would such a person want to leave Kellapp? ;People also build up their own market value,; said Adip. ;You will be helping him learn a commodity business, a skill not readily available in your industry,; explained Adip. ;With the commodity sector opening up, in three years, he could have good value in the market. We saw this happening in the telecom sector.; Nemani was unsure, but he was willing to play along. ;<BR>&nbsp; So, what kind of person do you want as the COO? Look at successful businesses, and at ones that were once where you are today and are already where you want to be. Look at the people who did all that. Let us not discuss compensation yet.; said Adip. <BR>&nbsp; Nemani was amused, but it sounded like a good way to talk about his dreams. ;Like someone who built Hindustan Lever Ltd's (HLL) detergents business, or Pepsi's bottling operations. &nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="81%" colSpan=3>I want someone like the person who built Citibank's credit card business, grew it and defined the market norms for quality, product expansion, who gave the category its width and recognition, changed marketing norms. Like someone who led SRF, slowly and steadily built its category leadership;, went on Nemani, slowly warming up to his prospective managing director. ;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Wonderful,; said Adip. ;Now, before we decide on their compensation, let us put down the qualities in these people that attract you.; ;<BR>&nbsp; People who are strivers, who have the breadth of vision to know where they want to take their businesses and how to get there. People who will not settle for half measures. People who can haul a business up a mountain and have the emotional stamina to do so, who can chalk out independent gameplans and have the guts to achieve,; said Nemani. ; </TD>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="23%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\79.GIF"> </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that we have benchmarked the quality of performance you are seeking, look at the remuneration that went with the job and look at the successful companies they belong to,; prompted Adip. For Adip knew he was not drawing an HLL manager for a Coke, or a Pepsi manager for a Dabur. First, he was hiring for Kellapp which was not known as the best of employers. Second, Kellapp was making losses. ;Third,; he said to Nemani, ;you have a full CEO agenda and you are asking the incumbent to build value in the business. How much of the value addition are you willing to share with him?; Gone are the days when an employer could say, this is the job, this is what I want, but we won't pay this much because the employment market says this is the going rate. Today, compensation had to be a variable, linked to what the manager can deliver to the business. As he said to Nemani: ;Today, if your share price and market capitalisation rise substantially, doesn't the incumbent have a role in attaining that? Shouldn't he get a share of that?;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Nemani would have to loosen his mind a bit, felt Adip, he was still caught up somewhere in the early 1980s, viewing managers as employees, viewing value-sharing as compensation, viewing partnering as hiring. Today's market was no more about jobs, salaries or employment. The managers today saw the whole market as a huge business opportunity, almost like a consulting firm, where they steered your business and shared in your value addition. <BR>&nbsp; But Nemani was not in sync. Today, the biggest problem that Nemani had was that he was the owner of the business and he held the ownership. The COO would have to share the ownership and reciprocally Nemani would have to share his profits with him. Nemani said: "You are trying to drive the compensation higher and making it very expensive for me."<BR>&nbsp; "Its not a question of compensation," said Adip. "It's about sweat equity. People are adding value to your organisation." Nemani could see the point Adip was making. Even so, he was rattled by the asking price. Adip tried again: "A ceiling to your offer will cut off people above that, and limit the talent you can attract. In my opinion, the person you are looking for may not lie in this bracket of Rs 60-70 lakh, but, probably in the next level, Rs 80 lakh-Rs 1 crore."<BR>&nbsp; "Naturally," said Nemani, "you could also find someone in the level below." "May be," agreed Adip, "but should you be paying lower because the incumbent comes from a lower remuneration category? Please understand, compensation is a way to position a job, not compensate in the real sense of the word." Adip was trying hard to reach into Nemani's mind. <BR>&nbsp; "I am not willing to pay that kind of money," interjected Nemani conclusively. "It's really a lot and I don't even know if he will deliver. I am willing to let the guy earn the money as he goes along. Therefore, I would suggest a very high component of variables and a lower fixed compensation." </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="20%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\80.GIF"> </TD>
<TD width="75%" colSpan=3>&nbsp;&nbsp; "But we cannot drag the fixed below his current fixed, " said Adip, "Why should he come? You are giving him a loss-making business, which he has to turn around, change and expand. You must offer him a fixed component which is higher than what he is getting, and a small variable which can grow fast. But you can't change entry compensation." <BR>&nbsp; The tussle was now over two issues. One, how much to pay now, and two, how to keep the incumbent involved and growing over time. Adip felt the COO's compensation must be between Rs 80 lakh-Rs 1 crore, with a definite plan for growing the variable component over the next three years. Nemani, however, was insisting it should be between Rs 60-65 lakh with an assurance to build it up to between Rs 80 lakh-Rs 1 crore in the next three years. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="100%" colSpan=5>
<P align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp; Adip said: "You are running the business, so you must take the risk. Why should an incumbent do so? You are saying, come to my parlour, never mind that you are selling toothpaste today, but do come and sell chemicals, make me profitable, grow my base to Rs 6,000 crore, make me globally competitive, my company is in a mess. The incumbent is risking his reputation by coming to a loss-making company which is not considered a premium employer, and it's style is neither proven nor successful. You must take the risk on compensation." <BR>&nbsp; "The value that you will place on the job will depend on whether your business is going to be in the big league in 2001. The COO has to come in today, not three years from now. The next few years are going to build the big league for you. Therefore, he cannot be 20% over the business head, he simply cannot be seen in relation to the business heads. You have to position him differently, price him differently and there's got to be this halo of exclusivity around him." <BR>&nbsp; "Am I paying Rs 1 crore or Rs 80 lakh for a trainee managing director?," asked Nemani.<BR>&nbsp; Adip replied: "Please understand, Kellapp is a Rs 2,000-crore company going up to Rs 6,000 crore. It's a different dimension altogether. This leads to other dimensions in functional and market services. The transition you are seeking is your mandate. His task is to deliver this mandate because you are not going to do it. You are going to invest and build the capacities. You are going to find the funds. Why, this man is going to play a very important role in that. Often, funds come because of the perceived quality of management. Today your company is a risk according to the financial institutions. When you have the right person, what you are communicating is, `we are gearing up and seriously.' Now, if this guy is to drive all that, how can he be priced at 20% over the business head?" <BR>&nbsp; "When your Coke and Pepsi and Kellogg's came in, they came with empty balance-sheets. No numbers. Just a forecast and a determination to reach those figures. Didn't they place the right man to take them to those heights, commensurate with the goals they sought? What defined their CEO's price was the value of their desire to take the brand to a certain level of performance and growth. That is what you have to do." <BR>&nbsp; For Nemani it was a mindset problem. He had never thought of paying employees' in tens of lakh. Neither had he imagined he would grow from Rs 750 crore to Rs 2,000 crore in two years. He was nervous coping with four-digit sales. But he was beginning to see how the business had suffered due to a lack of understanding of the needs of the organisation. He was in the red, and so he stood a greater risk of attrition which he could ill-afford. But whether he could make the transition depended a lot on his ability to shift gears. Compensation was his big hurdle which he still could not see as placing a value on a job and positioning it correctly. Instead, he now wondered, should he really hire a COO? </P></TD></TR>

<TD width="80%" colSpan=3><B>PREETY Kumar</B> <I>is the managing partner of Amrop India, a leading international executive search firm.<BR><BR></I>&nbsp; Dear Mr Nemani, <BR>&nbsp; It is clear that you are now faced with a decision that is the key to the survival of Kellapp Industries in the face of global competitive pressures to grow or sell out. Your decision to hire a COO and business heads, as well as your compensation strategy, will be the key to managing this agenda.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Kellapp needs to build on the work done by you, and consolidate its position over the next two years. Its survival is dependent on the ability to develop an organisation geared to working cohesively at higher corporate growth rates and at global scales of operation. As you said yourself, this task will not be run by you, but by professional managers who will manage the Rs 6,000-crore company that Kellapp aspires to be. The big question mark, however, is whether you are willing to let go of the belief that ownership implies management, and in the value you attach to the survival and success of Kellapp. This would answer the question that is nagging you -- the compensation for your successor.&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; Let me address the decision to hire a COO first. I agree with Bright &amp; Thakur's suggestion to establish an SBU structure within the organisation -- this would drive the organisational focus and the customer focus the businesses need to break away from the commodity mindset. It would consolidate Kellapp's position and give impetus to organisation building. The dilemma is whether to hire multiple SBU heads with or without hiring a COO. I believe that hiring just business heads has its drawbacks. First, it will not be able to attract managers capable of leading a Rs 6,000-crore organisation. Second, the person would be driving his own learning curve in the initial years, and would, therefore, come to grips with his SBU at the end of three years, and may not have a full organisational perspective. Third, the assignment gives only partial control. The level of exposure will also be limited, and will not make you confident enough to hand over the baton.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5><A target="_parent" class=punch>Business failure is a risk the company would take on in any event. But the real issue is your ability to hand over control transparently&nbsp;</A></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Hiring a COO is a good idea. He would be the second-in-command and be able to drive growth from day one. Also, a capable COO should be able to contribute to organisation-building early into his stint. Therefore, from the point of view of leading the company to multi-fold growth, a COO is essential for success. As for compensation, it is important to look at risk factors. As I see it, the company and the candidate are both taking risks which can be managed by cautious planning.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; From your perspective, the risk you bear is managing the transition of control without losing focus and key team members. Kellapp is highly leveraged, and runs the risk of collapsing mid-way through the transition. The COO may not be cut out for the task in the short term when he is still riding the learning curve nor in the long term (when he is realigning the company to perform at a higher order of magnitude). He may leave mid-way through the implementation of the plan, either due to failure or frustration at not getting the freedom to perform. From the candidate's perspective, the risks are personal. He could be moving from a high-growth career in a profitable firm, to a loss-making unit.&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="65%" colSpan=4>&nbsp; He's also looking at movement from a professionally-run set-up to a non-professional one, running the risk that the team may not be able to realign with new global ambitions. &nbsp; Business failure is a risk the company would take on in any event.&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; But the real issue is your ability to hand over control transparently -- to ensure continued leadership, and to give the COO space to perform. This would be critical to the success of this plan and would prevent him leaving mid-way due to frustrations with your management style. The arrangement I would recommend is to hand-hold for the initial six months while the COO understands the business, and draws up a recast plan. The next six months would involve handing over charge to the COO, while he establishes himself. After this, the COO should be given full authority.</TD>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="25%"><IMG SRC="my project_images\82.GIF"> </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; It is clear that this assignment is crucial for Kellapp's survival. I suggest that you do not look at compensation as the cost you bear to hire a manager, but rather the value you attach to Kellapp's survival and growth. The compensation should build in the higher risk attached to this move from your side and his. Clearly, your intention would be to pay for success, while the candidate would look for a substantial attraction factor to take up the job. This leads to a three-level compensation plan, with a fixed and a variable component, and stock options. The fixed component would have to build in the candidate-end risks and attractiveness factors. The variable component should build in the company-side risk that the COO does not perform. The stock options would help manage the retention risk. <BR>&nbsp; My suggestion, therefore, would be to hire a COO in addition to the business heads, and to compensate him on the value he brings to the organisation. The key issues at this stage are whether you are willing to trade off management control with survival, or you would rather look at compensation as the "cost" to hire a manager.&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp; Regards, Preety Kumar</TD></TR>

<TD width="80%" colSpan=3>&nbsp;<B> ASHOK Wadhwa </B><I>is the managing director of Ambit Corporate Finance which specialises in M&amp;As &amp; joint ventures.<BR></I><BR>&nbsp; In July 1991, when the government started the process of deregulation, it unwittingly put in motion an irreversible process which would have a profound impact on India's business landscape. This was the gradual shift in the balance of power between the various factors of production. In the traditional model, the key factors of production are land, labour, capital and technology. Before reforms, the balance of power lay with capital. Anyone with capital could set up a business, the regulated environment would ensure success.&nbsp;&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;&nbsp; But, post-liberalisation, the scenario has changed. Setting up an industry was no longer a guarantee of success. You needed skilled managers to ensure the success of any business. They began to realise that good people were hard to come by. And that once found, they had to be adequately incentivised. It is no surprise, therefore, post-1991, there has been an unprecedented rise in real salary levels for managerial staff. In any industry, the challenges match the rewards. And it is no surprise that the commodity business faces a severe crunch as far as managerial talent is concerned. The best headed for the fast moving consumer goods industry where there was both challenge and profit. <BR></TD></TR>

<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Nemani's situation is not unique. Kellapp is just one among the hundreds of Indian companies which paid little heed to managing their profitability in an era of high import margins. And, when the import duty protection vanished, their shortcomings were exposed. But, as Mr Nemani rightly says, there is also a vast opportunity for players who can achieve globally competitive cost, service and quality levels. The challenge lies in getting there. And what Mr Nemani still hasn't come to grips with is that the challenge cannot be met by throwing vast amounts of investment into plant and machinery. Only transformational leadership of a high calibre can make the difference.<BR>&nbsp; Mr Nemani is a true old-school entrepreneur who grew up in the days when the ability to take risks was disproportionately rewarded as compared to managerial skills. Consequently, the notion that managerial skills are as important as income-generating assets is alien to him.&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="81%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; It's a pity that someone who is willing to commit vast sums of money to expanding capacity is agonising over investing a much smaller amount in the right managerial talent. <BR>&nbsp; Mr Nemani needs to realise that this is no simple recruitment decision. It is in fact more akin to making an investment decision. Hiring the right person is probably the most crucial investment decision he will ever make. At stake is his wealth, because the right manager could multiply it while the wrong one could erode it. And if Mr Nemani wants to see if a model exists which would work for him, he can look at the West. It is an accepted fact in developed nations that if you want to attract super achievers you need to pay them handsomely. Also, it is not surprising for CEOs to make millions of dollars in salary and stock options.</TD>

<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;&nbsp; In Mr Nemani's situation, given that his resources are strained at present, Adip Rai's suggestion of a low fixed salary with a high variable component makes sense. The former's squeamishness at large numbers shows that Mr Nemani hasn't fully grasped the underlying logic that the more money the employee makes, the more money he will make. <BR>&nbsp; A corollary to "hiring the best" as a policy is "hiring as many of the best as you can find". Mr Nemani shouldn't shrink from the prospect of three highly paid employees. In fact, the best option would be to hire a COO and two business heads. This way, if one of them, or even two, don't work out as expected, he would have a viable option to fall back upon.</TD></TR>

<TD width="92%" colSpan=4><A target="_parent" class=punch>Alert's chief executive Raj Mehta faces a dilemma -- retaining a high performer while toeing the management line. Can he walk the tightrope successfully .</A></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="92%" colSpan=4>&nbsp; Abraham 'Abby' Kurien heard the taped music for the seventh time. He was on hold for his boss, Raj Mehta, who he had been told, was on the other line. ;Would you like to call back?;&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Mehta's secretary had asked. ;I am not sure I will remember to do so,; said Abraham. ;I prefer to hold on, I have nothing else to do,; he said.<BR>&nbsp; Abraham doodled on the paper before him. He was going to take one thing at a time. His list read, Speak to Raj'; it was first on the priority list. So, he was going to do just that. Everything else could wait, not that there was much to do otherwise. ;<BR>&nbsp; Hi! Abby,; came Raj's cheerful voice. That was Raj, always cheerful, always patient, always accommodating, always negotiable. ;Sorry, I kept you waiting...; he said. ;<BR>&nbsp; "Raj, I am resigning on 31st December. I wanted to tell you now so that you have time to find a replacement,; said Abby. ;<BR>&nbsp; "Gosh!; was all Raj managed for the moment. Then after a pause, when, as Abby mused, he framed his next sentence, he asked the inevitable:;Why?; <BR>&nbsp; "I am bored, irrevocably bored," said Abby. "There is no stimulation, no desire, no drive." <BR>&nbsp; Raj laughed. "You don't have to resign for that," he said cheerily. "Everybody feels like that some time or another.'' While he waited for Abby to offer some explanation, Raj continued: "What is it? Are you unhappy with the increment? Look, I do realise that 10% is nowhere near the 176% growth in revenues you brought us. But do you know, even the best manager got around 8.5% this year? We are cash strapped, Abby! Business has been tight. The only department that raked in decent figures was yours -- training. Between you and me, if it wasn't for the revenues from your department, I wonder what we would have done. The rest have done as badly or as well as last year. But we have to look at the business as a whole. You will understand, after all you head training. Your research across the industry must have a given you a fair idea of how bleak the horizon is for placement firms. I thought you understood our position. I haven't given so detailed an explanation to anyone, not even to our star manager K.C. Of course, he didn't complain about the increments we gave him... <BR>&nbsp; "Yes, you could say: He can complain all he wants, but does he have a choice? He is so singular in his experience he can at best make a lateral job change,' but do you think anyone else pays better? K.C. has, tremendous potential. If he puts his mind to it, he can go places. He is a skilled human resources (HR) manager and can make a great HR head somewhere. I have often wondered why he has preferred to stay in placement. I think he realises he can grow here, just as you can too. But K.C. is a private person. There is no telling what goes on in his mind. The 8.5% increment speaks nothing for his prowess, but such is life. We have to take the high with the low. Yet, I have given you 10%. I know K.C. is dying to know what I gave you, I am sure he will extract the information from you somehow..." </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="75%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; Raj went on: "Look, I know you are terrific. Isn't that important? And it isn't just me who thinks like that, even the clients are saying that. After every training session, I am inundated with praise for our training from every manager who attended your session and very soon will be signing up for another batch. You have so much going for you, why peg your growth to increments alone? Are you upset that they withdrew the car allowance this year?<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Look, I know that was unfair, but as I explained to you, the organisation is free to make changes in its terms of reference. Certain things are not under my control. I am merely the CEO. That title hardly bestows absolute powers on me. It is just the company's way of designating yet taking away all powers of management control. </TD>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="25%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\87.GIF"> </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; I don't control, I only manage! Isn't that the paradox of the millennium? I run the business, I am responsible for profits, but I have no control over costs or how the revenues are spent. You know how family-managed companies are. After all you are the training manager and you have 15 years of experience in HR management. <BR>&nbsp; "So, they make the rules. Even so, let me tell you, I fought hard to convince them that your loss should be restored. But they were adamant. You can't fault me for not trying. Look, it's just Rs 5,000, you will more than make up for it in the future. In any case, your wife earns a decent packet as media head at PanLeaf India. Double-income families have no cause for complaint about allowances! That was a joke, but I do think you must be rewarded for your efforts and I have always striven for that. Surely, that is not the reason for you to quit? What is it? <BR>&nbsp; "Is it because the decision to restructure the training department was not discussed with you? But I can't see how that can make you unhappy. Bringing in Markandey as profit-centre head was simply an operational convenience. You have so much to do in terms of developing the training software and training itself that it would have been foolhardy to dump administrative responsibilities on you! To be honest, I did want them to take you into confidence. But they were adamant. It's a family-managed company Abby, you know how they operate. Unilateral decisions are their prerogative. Maybe, you are annoyed that I did not discuss it with you. I told Brigadier Pant, our venerable owner, that considering how much you have contributed to conceiving the department, setting it up, marketing for clients and now the millions flowing in, you must be called in to contribute to the decision. You know what Pant said? I haven't ever met the man, I don't know if he has the capability to make judicious decisions. In any case, we cannot go about calling in all and sundry to craft decisions.' <BR>&nbsp; "But you know, that is Pant -- a maverick and cranky. You haven't missed anything if you haven't met him. The three of us at the helm simply endure him and humour him. He comes once in two months to rap our knuckles, a habit he probably picked up in the army, and to eat the dhansak from Brighton's. Do you want to know how his arrival fax reads?&nbsp; </TD></TR>

<TD width="80%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; Brigadier arriving on the 20th for the review meeting over lunch. Please call Mahrukh at Brighton for his special dhansak and three lagan nu custards. Cold pack two dhansak's for return... '' Raj laughed deeply.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he continued: "Anyway, so you know I did try. Pant is averse to participative management. Fortunately, his participation is restricted to rapping us on the knuckles and examining profits. He never looks at who we have hired for what, nor does he get excited by new business. Naturally, he is not interested in who is performing well or otherwise. Names don't register with him. Profits do. That is how he came up with the idea of floating the training business as a separate profit centre. Actually Prasanna, our operations head suggested it. Thereafter, Pant got feverish about the idea and wanted it wrapped up before his dhansak was finished. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; "In any case, I don't see Markandey as a stumbling block. He loves designations; he will have no time to interfere with your turf. Or has he? You must tell me. I heard that lately he has been playing emcee at your sessions. Don't let it bother you. How does it matter if he wants to come in during the first five minutes and say what a great firm Alert is? I know, he also goes on to say how committed he is to the cause of training and that if he is present during these sessions it is only to make sure that the client gets value for money. Look, all that is a public relations (PR) tack. Do you actually believe he is auditing your performance? What does he know about training, anyway? These days good PR alone works. You've got to lay it on thick so that the clients come back in hordes like moths through a crack in the window. This is good for business. We must let processes evolve with the times. <BR>&nbsp; "Frankly, I would be loathe to have a Markandey thumping his chest and declaring the training department as the raison d'etre of his existence. That's 15 minutes only. Do you think it eats into your session? Or, maybe, takes away the seriousness of what you originally conceived? Hey, it's alright! You think those managers in your class don't realise that? They are in the business of selling too! Okay, so Markandey's method is not Druckerian, but what can be done? He is Pant's blue-eyed boy. <BR>&nbsp; "Look, you are concerned about quality and focus. All this thing about PR does not wash with you. I remember what you told K.C. once: If you are good it will speak for itself, you don't have to do the chest-thumping act'. Wonderful! I know how passionately you feel about training. Maybe you wish Markandey would not come in like a commercial and break the continuity. I believe last week, in the midst of a session on succession planning, he got up to talk about his own succession to the post of department head at the State Bank of India. Did that bother you? Did the managers from Duvell say something? I believe they exchanged glances and were restless. Don't you think you should alleviate those feelings by subtly corroborating Markandey's role? Look, you can't be silent and lead the client to believe that you are some suffering soul. This is an organisation, Abby, a family. We have been together through thick and thin, remember? Alright, that was too heavy. What I mean is that you need to develop strategies to pre-empt these interruptions, or if they occur all the same, then to subtly thank Markandey for his wisdom and get on! By keeping quiet, you encourage him to go on and in turn waste valuable client time.&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="75%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; "Last week I got a call from Duvell's HR head, Dasgupta. He laid out an analysis of loss of return per hour! For God's sake! What are a couple of 15-minute breaks going to do to his return on investment?&nbsp; Okay, it's more like one hour, but we are trying to make profits. We will use our products to market ourselves.<BR>&nbsp; "These clients are unreasonable. They will not hesitate to announce in the middle of the World Cup that their pain balm is what makes Tendulkar a fine batsman. But if we take a short break during a session to announce how much other clients have benefited, they see that as loss of continuity. Why, Dasgupta even went so far as to allude that the last module, the syndicated group discussion, was cut short because of those interruptions. I know you loathe these commercial breaks' as you call them, but Markandey is adding value. </TD>

<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; "How else do we advertise our products? In training, the real advertising is on the spot, while the product is being delivered. Like that!; (Abby could hear him snap his fingers to drive home his point.) ;Then it gets carried by word-of-mouth. Not just the quality of the session, but also like, Did you know Alert has trained managers from Delaware in supply chain management? We must get that too...' and thus we get new business. But if we continue to follow your model of focused training and no breaks, the client takes away a lot for himself and we get nothing on an enduring basis. We want Duvell to come back for more, and that will happen with Markandey's methods. ;<BR>&nbsp; You probably feel that the original vision is being eroded. No, I say. Isn't our training revenue growing by leaps and bounds? Why else would a publisher like Gavin Delloit ask us to author a book on Training breakthroughs in India'? It's no mean offer, let me tell you, although I know you have declined it. You amaze me, Abby. Anyone would give an arm and a leg to get his name on a book like that. The trouble is you don't care enough. Pant is annoyed. In fact, that was the primary reason for his acidic remark I don't think he has the capability to make judicious decisions...' That's my reading, of course, not that he used the actual words. But it is easy to decipher what he means. ;<BR>&nbsp; I really think you should not have declined the offer. Because you know what happened next... Markandey is writing that book. I believe he has been video recording all the training sessions and using your wisdom to frame his script. Is that why you are going? Now really, Abby, I don't expect that sort of reaction from you. After all, you are the one who always says: 'It doesn't matter who gets the credit so long as the job is done'. Of course, I am going to make sure you get the credit somewhere. Maybe on the cover itself... Yes! That's what I will pitch for. I will speak to Gavin today and ask for the cover jacket to say, Drawn from the training lectures by Abby Kurien'. How's that? ;<BR>&nbsp; But you won't write that book and someone has to. After all, that is going to be the best PR and advertising for the firm. Just think about it. Hardbound, bold embossed title, glossy jacket and on every book-shelf! The Alert Principle Of Training And Development'. Can't you see that will brand our product as the country's best? They will come to us in hordes.; He continued: ''Frankly, I think you should, even at this stage, collaborate with Markandey. You must set aside all differences and take over the reins of that book before Markandey makes a mess of it. It will please Pant and, importantly, restore your equation with him.&nbsp; </TD></TR>

<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="20%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\90.GIF"> </TD>
<TD width="80%" colSpan=3>Maybe next year he will be more open-fisted during increments! Now, that was meant to be a joke, but it is a thought. &nbsp;You know how family-managed firms work. It is all based on personal equations, not merit. ;That was how Shakti Pulin got to be the HR head of Alert. Personal equation.&nbsp; I know you are still smarting over his move out of training at a time when you need him badly. What role is there for him as head of HR?' you ask. Look, that's our decision. People can't be stuck in one job for ever. Ask your friends in Hindustan Lever. Just because X sold Surf very well, do you think they won't move him to Close-Up? Of course they will. Good companies do that. And we are a good company. Shakti has to move too. I know you are angry about that. You feel Terrest did not sign up for winter because Shakti is not going to be on the panel.&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; That's rubbish. You are there. Yes, I realise you have 15 other clients to handle, what is a 16th? You fear there will be loss of quality? Rubbish! Not with you around. &nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Oh, now I know, you wanted to start an account management model in training and Markandey stymied that. I really think that was a brilliant suggestion. But Markandey is a business head, he must be empowered to make decisions. He feels there will be costly duplication of effort. In any case, we are not so large, we have just 16 clients. Once there are 30 or 40 clients, it might work. You said something about creating industry-specific training database centres -- what was that? I did not understand anything. Even so, I pushed, you know. Markandey was adamant. I wish you would talk to him and convince him. You must. I think you must accept Markandey as a power to reckon with. He has great depth. Spend some time with him, he is a virtual storehouse of information. You will like him.; <BR>&nbsp; Raj continued: ;I still don't see why you are being difficult. I am not accepting your resignation, you must know that. No way. Not by the hair of my chinny chin chin', as my daughter would say. Never. You must tell me the reason for your boredom. How can you be bored, with so much work? I can understand Markandey saying that. He doesn't have much to do. But he is getting involved. He is a quick learner even at his age. I would have thought some kind of lethargy would have set in. But no, he is raring to go. For instance, he has insisted on taking the training session next week on team building for Camylla Pharma. I saw his brief, his notes ran into 47 pages. And he spent the entire Saturday hearing and re-hearing your team sessions for Ribbifar Shoes. I heard you were devastated. He has no HR background, you say. What has that got to do with lecturing? At least, he's making an effort. ;<BR>&nbsp; Don't think I don't have my ears to the ground. I heard about the exchange of words you had with Markandey over this. You told him that team building for shoes and team building for the pharmaceuticals industry are as different as Superman's cape and the Cape of Good Hope. Now, why did you say that to Markandey? Look, team building is an art. The principles are the same, whether you are selling shoes or shower gel. You feel that the marketplace nuances determine the thrust and drive of team building. Now really, Abby, you must credit Markandey with some intelligence. After all, this is his maiden session. You must encourage him. How else will he learn? And to make matters worse, you tell him we have to respect the faith the client places in our zero-based approach to research-based training'. What research base, Abby? How can Markandey possibly go out and research 10 pharmaceutical firms before he structures his session? I believe you told him he must use your researchers. That was nice of you, but you know he was furious because you referred to them as my research staff' and not our research staff'. ;<BR>&nbsp; Actually, the research staff' would have fitted nicely. You must be careful about what you say. You cannot go about stepping on the corns of people like Markandey. The next thing you know he will be on the phone long-distance to Pant. ;<BR>&nbsp; Abby, I realise you are doing tremendous work. I appreciate that. But you must not let these things bother you. Look at the fine work you have put in. You have created a virtual revolution in training by getting managers of different companies to collaborate in training. If you leave, I can't see us being able to sustain the department. I am not letting you go, not by the...; ;<BR>&nbsp; Raj?; said Abby. ;As I was saying earlier, 31st December is my last day.; </TD></TR>

When you try to understand situations like these it is important to focus on patterns that exist. There are patterns in what people do and in what organisations do. Some patterns are inherent and some arise out of the interaction the inherent patterns have with the context they are placed in.

<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Raj is a communicative person who tries to be all things to all people. He has a fixed set of beliefs. He would rather project his belief as a consensus view or the view of a person who cannot be questioned. At one level, he creates a sense of camaraderie by agreeing with Abby and portrays himself as helpless and only a cog in the system. At another level, he almost delivers the sense of ultimate power with veiled threats of consequences.<BR>&nbsp; He derives authority from evoking myths and stereotypes about the family management concern. Raj's style of leadership is reminiscent of the proverbial divide and rule. He puts forth strategic decisions as decisions based on personal equations. He is a strategist and a political person. He has complete hold over the pulse of the organisation. He has informal channels of communication which tell him what is happening in the company and who is saying what. He also knows who feels what but chooses to ignore the emotional impact of the processes put in place by him. He is a person who is likely to bloat the problem to seem more successful when solved.&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;&nbsp; He is unlikely to be able to listen to other people because he is strategising his next move even when he is trying to be helpful. He is mentally arguing with the person when they are expressing what they feel. Whenever Raj is asked about Abby, he is likely to say: ;Wonderful person, very clever.; But do not the miss the curl of the lip, the half smile and the half wince that is likely to go with it.&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; Abby is a man with ideas and a great belief in fairness. He tries to be patient with people, allows them to have a say and tries to understand them. Raj is aware of his empathetic capacity and uses it as a tool to disarm him. Raj tries to get Abby to empathise with him, with Markandey, with Pant and with the organisation at various stages in the conversation. This is perhaps not the first time Abby has gathered courage to let Raj know about how he feels but in the past Raj managed to evoke Abby's empathy on a number of occasions. Abby's ability to see things from other people's point of view is his greatest strength, and his greatest limitation. He understands his clients' needs and, hence, can formulate training that people find usable. He tries to understand other people in his team and in the process he becomes unassertive. He then gives up what is genuinely his to accommodate other people.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="75%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; He has given up so many times that the lack of control makes him helpless and rudderless. He sees no option now except leaving and starting afresh.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He comes across as a person who wants to pay attention to quality and detail. He is a person who believes passionately in what he is doing. He likes variation and unless the work can contribute to his growth as a person he would not do it.<BR>&nbsp; The book offer may have been rejected because it is only a repetition of what I have done'. Abby likes people to be aware and sensitive and is unlikely to voice his needs. He would like his work to speak for itself. In short, a quiet, introspective person, someone who would find it tough to survive in the corridors of politics.</TD>

<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; A word about Alert. An organisation that tries to promote people on what they say and not on what they do has a problem on its hands. If there is only one division that is making profit the need should be to learn from it and see what is working. If I were Pant, rather than saying that I do not know the man making the most money for me, I would immediately call him and ask: ;What do you think we could do differently to turn around the organisation?' Rather than creating notional power centres like the head of human resources or profit-centre head for training, there is a need to let that person who knows the customer make the decisions. This would only happen if the gossip and backbiting channels that exist were not nurtured.<BR>&nbsp; Successful organisations cannot be run as political parties or personal fiefdoms. There has to be a feedback system that allows it to correct its course. Everyone at Alert feels the need to perpetuate a communication pattern that validates his or her own viewpoint. Raj does not listen to Abby but knows what he might have to say from other sources' and tries to counter his thoughts without hearing them. Similarly, Abby has developed a belief system that no one cares in the organisation and so it is best to keep what you feel to yourself. Pant feels that he knows best intuitively' but what is called intuition is only an incomplete information-gathering exercise -- information gathered by listening to people who tell you what to listen to. Such organisations that do not look out for patterns in their decision-making or their performance end up as myopic entities. Short-sighted in their vision and short-term in their existence.</TD></TR>

<TD width="80%" colSpan=3>&nbsp;<B> Matangi Gowrishankar</B> <I>is vice-prisident(human resource at ICIL.</I> <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; Raj Mehta's monologue is a study in organisation dynamics and the dynamics within Alert. Interestingly, I believe that the case has less to do with being a family-managed company (FMC) and more to do with styles of leadership and how people respond to them. Alert appears to be managed by a tyrant in Pant. He makes all the decisions without involving the key managers who run the organisation. <BR>&nbsp; Not all FMCs are like that. I know of some where the chairman is involved in hiring every key manager and of companies with CEOs like Pant </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Mehta typifies those managers who leave their conscience at home and focus on getting their jobs right, delivering what the boss wants.&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; It is clear that he feels for the wrongs that have been heaped on Abby but does not want to correct them since he is not empowered to do so. His main concern is to get things right for Pant and keep his head above water.&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; He has, in fact, taken the solid, strong performer Abby for granted. It is apparent that significant changes that concerned Abby personally and professionally were neither discussed with him, nor intimated to him. This is unacceptable in any organisation. </TD></TR>

<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Markandey is a different story altogether. He is capitalising on the fact that he is the chosen one. In his quest for self-aggrandisement, he does not really care that he is hurting the carefully cultivated client base and undermining the quality that Alert is acclaimed for. In such circumstances, what can a person like Abby do? His claim that there is no excitement, no drive, is just an expression of the frustration he feels at seeing his assiduously created training arm being demolished. Abby is a good corporate citizen, one who takes pride in his work and delivers value to the organisation he works for. For him reward is not necessarily monetary, it is in being involved, it comes from his knowing that he is valued by the organisation. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="75%" colSpan=3>&nbsp;&nbsp; Between Mehta's inability, or rather unwillingness, to present the right picture to Pant and Markandey's quest for the limelight, a good corporate citizen like Abby is lost and disillusioned. Abby expects Mehta's support, which is not forthcoming. He has been told that Markandey cannot be touched and he is unable to influence his tactics. So the only option left for him is to leave. Abby is a high performer but he belongs to this strange breed of people who will not trumpet their achievements or what they can deliver. In the end, such managers have to pay a heavy price. They become fiercely competitive or disrupt the organisation, or like Abby, become more introverted and opt out of the game. </TD>

<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Caught up as they are in the fight for survival, organisations find it difficult to be sensitive to individual personalities and inclinations. While organisations have in the past represented surrogate homes where managers looked after their people, this is not possible in today's highly competitive environment. This, however, does not absolve an organisation of its responsibility to uphold propriety and build a culture where people are valued. Successful organisations have a well-defined culture of justice and fair play, where performance and contribution are recognised. <BR>&nbsp; Alert can be in deep trouble if its high performers leave. Pant will be surrounded by yes men' and no profits. Organisations that create helplessness in their people can never hope to survive. Just as it is felt that values like commitment, loyalty aren't virtues any longer, organisations can't afford to take people for granted. If Alert loses its standing in the market, it has only itself to blame for it forgot about the crucial people factor... Recognise, involve and appreciate people, or perish! </TD></TR>

<TD width="90%" colSpan=4 height=36><A target="_parent" class=punch>Prem Raghuvanshi's eyes are fixed on Rago's hot brand, Soz. But should he buy it at all? Or should Raghuvanshi simply live and let live? </A></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="90%" colSpan=4 height=69>&nbsp; Prem Raghuvanshi felt dissipated. Eight months ago, when he started negotiating with Rago Foods to buy Soz, its ready-to-cook brand, Rago was excited, even enthusiastic about selling Soz to Bluehill Foods Inc. But now, the negotiations dragged on and on, laboured, leaving Prem completely disillusioned. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Prem and Rago's directors were happy until a few weeks ago. For, Soz's distribution network and plant facilities in Haryana would cut short its market entry stages, besides giving it a readymade market share. Then Rago doubled the price. Prem was weary with the two warring factions at Rago -- one wanted to keep Soz, the other desired a handsome price and wanted to plough the money into Rago's booming dairy products business and had commenced fresh talks with another prospective buyer. Naturally, Prem was anxious. <BR>&nbsp; A tired and hopeless Prem sought the counsel of Atul Datta, friend and research professor at a leading management institute. Atul's advice: Bluehill should avoid the takeover route. "Indian corporate history is replete with takeover tragedies, whether they were intended to nurture the brand or kill it. In any case, killing competition is not good for business," he said.&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; That came as a surprise to Prem. "You will end up expending a lot more energy managing a newer set of variables, which very often can take away more than they can contribute," said Atul. "Look at what the purchase of Thums Up and Limca did for Coke. Coke too bought Thums Up for a readymade distribution network, and a sitting market share of 55%. And like you, it planned to slowly withdraw Thums Up and replace it with Coke. But everytime they tried killing Thums Up, Pepsi took away the market. It didn't go to Coke. So, Coke had to allow Thums Up to survive. Can you imagine the kind of energy that was wasted fighting the wrong battle? Having bought Thums Up, it was faced with competition in their own drawing room. Do you want that?"</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="75%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; "Buying out competition to kill it, is marketing machismo," said Atul. "You should rethink the idea. Brand supremacy is to be proven in the market place, not in the morgue."&nbsp; But the fact was Soz was ready to sell and this was Prem's point. "Forget for a moment the intention behind my purchasing Soz," he said. "Rago wants to sell Soz, it's not a covert takeover! "Neither was there pressure from Pepsi or Coke on Parle to sell," said Atul softly. "Parle felt that with both Pepsi and Coke in, it had no chance of saving Thums Up. That in the ensuing battle between the two giants, and given the kind of money the two would unleash, Thums Up would die like a poor man. So it is said, Parle offered Thums Up and Limca to Coke. It wasn't selling so that Coke should find the going easy in a new market!It was selling because it made sound business sense for Ramesh Chauhan to sell Thums Up. But did it make sound business sense for Coke to buy? That's my point!" </TD>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="25%" colSpan=2 height=194><IMG SRC="my project_images\97.GIF"></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Likewise,'' asked Atul, "does it make sound business sense for you to buy Soz? It certainly makes a lot of sense for Rago to sell, after all you are a multinational, deep pockets, panic in your heart, great hurry for distribution clout, and Rago feels that Soz is a lost cause once you make an entry. After all, you have your own brand Tom Yum in that category. So, Rago will sell Soz. But what about you? Taking over competition may have its upside, but it will create a lot of stress for you.<BR>&nbsp; "Besides, Atul did not think Bluehill needed to adopt this route. "You have chosen this route, because it is much easier and a short cut to market supremacy in an evolving economy like India," he said. "And you can afford to do that because you have the power of money. If you want Tom Yum to gain, you need more than money power. You need energy. And that goes for any marketing situation. For example, you can have one stupid ad running 100 times on the World Cup or you can have a brilliant ad running 10 times. Both ads cost the same kind of money, but one of those ads is going to return vastly on the investment, the other could even take away from your investment," said Atul. <BR>&nbsp; Continuing his analysis of whether money energises marketing, Atul said: "Mere aggression is not indicative of energy. My favourite example has always been the Polo-Minto ad exchange. Nestle said, 'The mint with the hole' a hundred times, Minto came in unobtrusively and whispered, 'All mint, no hole'. That one ad was so effective, so packed with punch, it took the wind out of Polo. It is a different thing that Nestle countered it later, and aggressively too, but the point is, the delayed aggression was thanks to money power. If it had been energised aggression, the original situation wouldn't have gone on for so long. Very simply, money power doesn't always equal energy. " <BR>&nbsp; "It's like this Prem," continued Atul. "If you have less money, then a lot of thinking will go behind every ad spend because you know you have only one arrow and it must hit when it is launched. But if you have many arrows, then you will keep launching until one hits. That's the fundamental difference. And then you also have it drilled into your head, 'Let's think long-term'. But didn't Marico too think the haul is long when it bought Sil? When pockets are shallow, you say, the haul ends tomorrow, I must achieve my target sales now. It's not that the richer brands are laidback, but they have the wherewithal to try and err, and the errors don't show since there is already so much fanfare surrounding their brand. But what happens is the deep pockets also tends to dissipate creativity; it lends a certain lethargy to aggression." <BR>&nbsp; Atul pointed to a yellowing letter pasted on his pin board. It was from his daughter's school principal. "...if you give a child too many comforts, he does not learn how to struggle, to persevere, to create, to innovate..." <BR>&nbsp; "See that?" said Atul. "A simple 'ism' in child rearing. Father Bonaventure sent that to me when my daughter produced a history project out of Encarta, with colour printouts of the Jama Masjid. I thought it was a terrific effort, but Father wished she had visited the Masjid and researched first hand. There is a message for you and Bluehill there," he said with a smile. "Buying out Soz is a short cut, but it's tantamount to destroying competition which is a destructive strategy," he said. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="20%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\98.GIF"> </TD>
<TD width="80%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; Atul now stated another theory of acquisitions: destroying competition stunts the market. "Take Walls," he said. "It bought out competition -- Dollops, Milk Food, Kwality, and but for parts of Kwality, the others were killed. The decision to kill Dollops was a horrific idea. Dollops was parlour business whereas worldwide Walls is a retail brand. Within six months, all the Dollops parlours were closed. So, where is the parlour habit today? Where are those wonderful flavours like litchee and melon and carrot cabaret? That is stunting the market.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Five years ago if you switched on the television, you usually saw an ice-cream ad. All these small brands were growing, the market was growing too, albeit slowly.&nbsp;Today, you see only soft drink ads.The ice-cream habit never picked up as it should have, instead consumers found a new recreation habit, colas and pizzas. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; "Question is, why did Walls take over competition? The market itself could have grown had there been some competition. But there was no competition left. If there had been competition in the industry, the synergies that your company gains from an acquisition naturally benefits the total industry." <BR>&nbsp; "These are highly debatable issues,'' cautions Prem, ''besides which all these brands which you talk of as being bought out, had declared they were unfit to continue in business." <BR>&nbsp; "Relatively speaking. Relative to competition, mind you. If Walls hadn't come in, Dollops would have gone on, long enough to prove its viability. Milkfood would have gone on too. So, who decided these brands were unfit and under what provocation?'' asks Atul. "The provocation was a mythical, imported management principle, which said, 'Core competency is what works. If you are selling chocolates, don't mess with ice-creams'. The core competency principle has been highly exaggerated to the point of abuse. But they averred, if you stray from your knitting, you will be unprofitable. So, everyone examined their knitting and started selling. <BR>&nbsp; "Thankfully, not everyone panicked. They decided to trust their marketing energies. Today, seven years down the line, we can see the kind of initiatives they made. Companies like Dabur, like Britannia. They responded to competition." Thus came Atul's next theory: competition causes performance.<BR>&nbsp; "What happens when you allow competition to survive?" he now asked. "It decreases prices, improves the total market performance, makes the consumer more demanding, which in itself triggers innovation, creativity and quality. How did Dabur go through an overhaul? Competition. How did Britannia step up its market presence and categories? Competition. Competition makes it imperative for every player to revamp his approach and change. Why is Surf continuously adding value? Because if it didn't, then someone else is going to offer that value addition and take away its consumer set. Competition is what allows for product improvement. <BR>&nbsp; "Therefore, competition also improves performance," said Atul. What is happening in the airline industry today? Once Sahara came in, Jet Airways reduced prices and so did Indian Airlines. The consumer electronics industry is a great example of how competition is offering the consumer value for money. No doubt the system will shed the unviable players, but Thums Up was not unviable, Dollops and Milkfood simply did not have the money to conquer the market in one go. But as brands, they were terrific. If Walls or a Pepsi or a Coke could not return profits in seven years, how could a Dollops have been expected to return profits in two years?&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="75%" colSpan=3>&nbsp;&nbsp; We are very forgiving of a foreign brand, Prem, but we do come down heavily on an Indian brand.&nbsp;And that is because as a people, as investors, as business managers, we have not evolved. We lack patience and awareness. Liberalisation requires patience, not predators." Atul was confident that if Bluehill steered clear of its current strategy to buy out Soz, it would end up with a better performance. "If it wasn't for Nirma, Lever's detergent business would have been a different story," he said. "Surf would have still been the leader, just as Coke will be in 10 years, but it would have been a long and boring story of we tried, tried and tried. Not, we thought, thought and thought, which is what led to Wheel, and the Rin variants. To Ariel and its variants. Simply, competition advances performance."</TD>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="25%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\99.GIF"> </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Prem felt recharged by Atul's outbursts. He asked: "What would have happened if Coke hadn't bought Thums Up, that is, if Parle hadn't sold out?" Prem was really thinking about what Bluehill's fate would be without Soz. <BR>&nbsp; "I wonder myself," said Atul. "At least one thing is clear, Coke would have been in a better position. Can't you see? Today it has a 56% market share, but how much of that is pure Coke? If it hadn't bought Thums Up and Limca, chances are its current 56% market share would have been smaller, but it would be entirely made of the Coca-Cola brands. And it wouldn't be spending so much money fighting Thums Up. Its market warfare would have been more focused." <BR>&nbsp; Atul was emphatic Prem should not succumb to the pressure to buy his arch competitor, Soz. "Buying competition does not guarantee success, my friend," he said. "Because a lot of Coke's energies went into killing a brand and not so much in developing Coke, their energies got split. That I think made a lot of difference to what Coke did. <BR>&nbsp; "Yet look at what competition did for Pepsi," he said. "It's rival was just one, Coke. Not Thums Up and Limca. If Pepsi was lacklustre those initial years after its Indian entry, I think it was because Coke had not arrived. Life at Pepsi is about challenging Coke. When it came to India, that challenge was not there. Those early years were very pessimistic. It got weighed down by issues like the government, the export obligations, the bottlers, joint venture relationships... which were not doled out only to Pepsi. Most new entrants faced constraints of one kind or the other. All that fell into place the moment Coke came in. Just like that! How come? Some call it coincidence, I call it burst of energy. The energy came with the entry of Coke. Suddenly, there was a reason. They got energised with the news of Coke's entry. Suddenly, all other problems seemed small. Simply, competition caused performance. <BR>&nbsp; "Pepsi too had the option of buying out Thums Up. It didn't. Never mind the reasons. Simply examine the different turn of events for Goliath A who bought out competition and Goliath B who did not buy out competition and look at their market share composition. There is some food for thought there for you," said Atul. "And mind you," he continued, "it was competition that grew the soft drinks market. Competition increases consumption. If the cola market is growing, it's because of the continuous distraction and entertainment provided by the cola wars. What Sachin did, what Aamir did, what Pepsi said, what Coke said... it goes on. But in ice-creams there is no war. So consumption is not fun. Walls has no one to fight. The ice-cream message is coming from a single voice, Walls. Excitement is when five people scream ice-cream. There is no fun in the category." Thus came Atul's next theory: competition is good for business and market growth. <BR>&nbsp; "You need somebody to fight," he said, "That's what keeps your adrenaline charged and active. Take Cadbury. It did not grow the market aggressively until Kit Kat came. As a monopoly it had no competition and the market did not grow. Prices were going up. The chocolate industry was Cadbury, so it never examined the opportunities. It said: 'Cocoa is expensive. Excise is high. Sales tax is high. Indians don't eat chocolates -- it is a western concept. Indians eat mithai. &nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="20%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\100.GIF"> </TD>
<TD width="80%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; They don't eat chocolates in the rural areas. Only children eat chocolates...' It defined the market with its constraints. So whenever there was a problem, it increased the price. You didn't have a choice, you either ate chocolates or you didn't. By default, the Indian consumer chose mithai.<BR>&nbsp; "When Nestle entered chocolates, Cadbury didn't suffer, because Nestle's entry lacked aggression. Just examine the competitive responses of both players. Nestle resorted to being a me-too. If you have a Dairy Milk, I have Nestle Milk , you have a Five Star, I have a Bar One, till they came and said I have a Kit Kat. That was when the horse power at Cadbury shot up. Its sleeping giant Cadbury Dairy Milk (CDM), woke up.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;&nbsp; Kit Kat broke into a huge success. Coincidentally, Cadbury launched Perk at the same time, which was similar to Kit Kat in form. Now look at what competition did. The whole chocolate biscuit category flew wide and huge. It became so huge, that it became bigger than even CDM, the biggest category until then. Suddenly, grown ups were eating chocolates, rural areas became opportunities for growth, and no one wondered if Indians preferred mithai! That's how competition grew the market phenomenally. Now compare this with what Walls and Coke did with competition. See?" said Atul. <BR>&nbsp; "So," went on Atul, "don't try to kill competition. If you have the money to buy a company, use it to set up your own plant and distribution, just like Pepsi did. And innovate and energise your aggression. Let competition live, they will give you a reason to reach out for the best in you. Don't look at what Surf did after Ariel came. Look at what Surf did before Ariel and Nirma. Look at what Cadbury did before Kit Kat. And also look at what the ice-cream industry was and what it is today after the demise of competition. They are studies in the power of competitive forces.<BR>&nbsp; " Buying market share was easy, felt Atul. It does give readymade markets. But there is no study to show that this strategy works or does not, he said. <BR>&nbsp; And what about the cost of buying out competition? "Point is, did the acquisition money pay itself back?" he asked Prem. ''Did you fix a payback period? Did the returns come from Thums Up or from Coke? Real payback is if it came from Coke. For the Coca-Cola Company, revenue from Thums Up is not real earnings or growth. Revenue from Coke is. <BR>&nbsp; "Only then can it be said that buying competition worked for your brand," said Atul. "The other yardstick would be, how much did you contribute to market growth? If it was x%, then how much came from Thums Up and how much from Coke." <BR>&nbsp; Prem was confounded. Did Atul's theories stand on good ground, he wondered. No, he was not rethinking his buyout of Rago, but about letting Soz live. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Most learning is hindsight," said Atul. "Nobody knows at the time what the future holds. These acts are done assuming that events a, b, c will occur. Until these results unfold, it remains just an action. It's only five years since competition died in soft drinks and ice-creams. But what we see so far is that killing competition wasn't good business for the total industry," ended Atul.</TD></TR>

In the absence of figures, costs and overall quantitative data, we are restricted to qualitatively studying here the hypotheses that Atul Datta is passionately presenting to Prem.&nbsp;&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>Whether it is due to the physical tiredness that follows too much squash or the mental fatigue of a protracted takeover battle, poor Prem appears defenceless against this onslaught. Some are truisms that the bravest marketer in the subcontinent would be loathe to challenge, some are so fuzzy a sophist could quote corporate history to support either interpretation. <BR>&nbsp; Let's deal with them, one by one, and see where it leaves Prem: in a blind alley or a dark tunnel with a light at the end. Hypothesis One: In an evolving market like India, it is easier to gain market supremacy by using your cash to support your own brand than buying out rivals. <BR>&nbsp; True. In a market where penetration figures in most categories are single digit, the prime task of a marketer is conversion, attracting category non-users. In foods, the penetration figure for branded atta is about 4%, branded salt 15%. And despite the combined efforts of Pepsi and Coke, the penetration of soft drinks in India is around 14%, rising to a high of 40% in the higher socio-economic class segments. That means even at the upper end of the market, you have more non-category users than other brand users. Which is perhaps why Coke (correctly!) acknowledges its competition as water, nimbu pani, naariyal paani, not Pepsi.<BR>&nbsp; In Prem's category of ready-to-cook foods, the penetration would be pathetic enough not to show on the radar, which validates Atul's hypothesis. Unless, of course, like the oft-quoted Coca-Cola company, you have enough cash to do both: support your own brand and buy competing brands! </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5><A target="_parent" class=punch>As far as Prem Raghuvanshi is concerned, soz alive is better than soz dead, whether he buys it out from rago or not&nbsp;&nbsp; </A></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; This means, if Prem can afford to buy Soz, he must. And just as Coca-Cola paid Mr Ramesh Chauhan an additional $20 million for the bottling plants, he should do that too. Hypothesis Two: Competition is good for market growth.<BR>&nbsp; Atul's second truism. Of course, the flip side of the competition coin is choice. The wider the range of choices for the consumer whether in kind or cost, the higher the likelihood of his entering a category, though, in India, it is the price that is the key to large volumes. The moment Cadbury's launches Dairy Milk cubes for Rs 2 each, as it declared recently, a vast number of consumers will finally be able to afford to lay their hands on a chip of an old dream: enjoying a vilayati sweet.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Nirma was good for the laundry market. At Rs 7 a kilo on its launch date, it cost one-third the market leader's product and converted soap users, fuelling the growth of detergent powders. It was also good for Hindustan Lever, which responded by changing its paradigm, and launched Wheel, which in turn converted more soap users. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="75%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; Of course, the battle for market share is easier to win when you as a corporate own more than one brand in a category. Then you can assign roles, comparative, monadic, competitive, whatever. After all, Coca-Cola owns four of the top five soft drinks in the world. It bloods its brands when required, to engage in man-to-man combat, in different segments. So, as far as Prem is concerned, Soz alive is better than Soz dead, whether he buys it out from Rago or not. Hypothesis Three: Necessity is the mother of creativity. <BR>&nbsp; When Atul mentions that money blunts marketing aggression, he's opening up a debate that sophists would love. Supporters of size and economies of scale would argue that's the only way to succeed.&nbsp; </TD>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="25%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\102.GIF"> </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>When the Chinese juggernaut invades India with colour televisions (TVs) at Rs 6,000 apiece, churned out by manufacturing units with capacities equal to the entire TV industry in India, what creativity can you invoke to do battle? <BR>&nbsp; Supporters of skill and precision would cite Biotique, a brand that has carved a sizeable niche in personal care, without spending a rupee on advertising, the chief weapon of both the multinational and the local biggies in the fray. Remember, personal care is one of the ten biggest adspending categories. <BR>&nbsp; How should Prem walk this razor's edge? Does he have a choice? If he buys Soz, yes. He can juggle between his own Bluehill brands and Soz, hopefully at different price points. If Rago doesn't sell Soz to Prem, he is in a worse soup. He is committed to a category that is alien to Indian culinary practices. Even though 73% of families here are now nuclear, and there are more double-income households than before, the percentage of housewives who would give up the satisfaction of cooking a meal for the family is low indeed. Prem is yet to set up his distribution network. And in a low interest, low involvement category like ready-to-cook foods, his brand name Tom Yum would carry no resonance, unlike global brands like Nike or Coke. Prem's best chance is in pursuing Rago to part with Soz... and letting it thrive alongside his own. Remember, coexistence or no existence. </TD></TR>

The process of acquiring a firm, hostile or friendly, involves a bargaining phase where both players seek to maximise payoffs. In that sense, Rago's revision of the bid value seems to be a rational tactic. It would also not be surprising if it introduced another prospective buyer to increase bargaining strength, since at this point of time Bluehill has not started talks with alternative incumbents to strengthen its bargaining position. </TD></TR>

From public policy analysis, to agency problems in management of multinationals, to entry strategies, Atul convincingly argues for axiomatic changes in attitudes and actions. <BR>&nbsp; Atul's theses that "competition causes performance" and "destroying competition stunts markets" are fairly well-developed propositions in public policy analysis that economists and policy makers are sensitive to. The purchase of Thums Up by Coca-Cola brought this issue into sharper focus. Observers have pointed out the inadequacy of prevailing anti-trust laws in India. Whether Thums Up-Coke is comparable with Rago-Bluehill needs to be analysed. Prem's dilemma about whether to let Soz live or not clearly indicates that Atul's advice is being seriously considered. And this is, indeed, encouraging. </TD></TR>

<TD width="100%" colSpan=5><A target="_parent" class=punch>Reduced Incentives to innovate are detrimental to market growth as will as competence development within the company&nbsp;</A></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;While the erstwhile Monopolies &amp; Restrictive Trade Practices Act was diluted earlier this decade, legislation that replaces it is yet to be passed. One can hardly disagree with Atul when he cites examples like airlines, ice-cream etc, to substantiate his theses. However, where Atul departs from conventional thought is in the application of these concepts to strategic management in general and entry strategies in particular. <BR>&nbsp; This is his argument: for firms planning to enter a market, takeovers have to be evaluated not only from the benefits obtained from readymade production facilities and a well-oiled supply chain, but also the long-term costs the entering firm may need to pay that arise out of a relatively "easy" entry into the market.&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="75%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; These costs could include the sub-optimalities arising out of a potential reduction in rivalry. These sub-optimalities arise out of the fewer incentives to innovate. This in the long run is detrimental to market growth as well as competence development within the firm. The negative externalities that arise from an aggressive and, perhaps, insensitive entrant, Atul hypothesises, is greater than the operational and strategic benefits he would acquire. This proposition, from a theoretical viewpoint, would definitely require further examination.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Businessmen are usually sensitive to these points while planning strategies. However, Atul's plea is directed at CEOs of MNCs who, with deep pockets and an urge to quickly show results, tend to look at the "buy" option as an expedient solution, ignoring these negative externalities.</TD>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="25%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\104.GIF"> </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; This is the single most important message in his discourse. <BR>&nbsp; The balanced score card used to define a CEO's performance in MNC subsidiaries in less-developed markets may have to be incorporated. The absence of adequate legal mechanisms in India to block social welfare reducing takeovers puts an extra burden on the MNCs to ensure that CEOs are sensitive to these negative impacts. This is important to them not only from a strategic management viewpoint but also the extent to which an MNC is perceived to exhibit "good" behaviour worthy of a corporate citizen of the country. The experiences recounted by Atul definitely establish the prima facie for this prescription. <BR>&nbsp; Whether Thums Up-Coke is comparable with Rago-Blue hill needs to be analysed. Prem's dilemma about wheter to let Soz live or not clearly indicates that Atul's advice is being seriously considered. And&nbsp; this is, indeed, encouraging.</TD></TR>

<TD width="92%" colSpan=4><A target="_parent" class=punch>Rajdeep Kohli thought selling products to Children was something marketers like him knew all about. Then his 12-year-old son Pranav told him otherwise</A></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="92%" colSpan=4>&nbsp; Rajdeep Kohli entered his house singing a Johnny Cash hit song, "These boots are made for walking..." with the same accent and an energetic shake of the hips. "Pannu baba," he called out cheerily, placing a shoe box on the dining table where his 12-year-old son Pranav sat playing solitaire. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; "What's this?" asked Pranav, touching the box. "The new, most spectacular shoe from Freedom, only for kids!" said Rajdeep, dramatically. "It rolled out today from the factory, I was dying to show it to you! Take a look..."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp; Pranav examined the shoe, turning it around. "Are these running shoes, sports shoes or just casuals?" he asked. "Sports shoes," said Rajdeep. <BR>&nbsp; "In that case, it should be turned upward at the toes, dad," said Pranav. "That gives great momentum." <BR>&nbsp; "These are for kids, Pannu," said Rajdeep. "Yeah, so?" asked Pranav. "Kids run and play sports, dad. You make that sound as if because it is for kids, it can be any old rubbish!" <BR>&nbsp; "Hey, that's not fair!" said Rajdeep, a little annoyed. "What I meant was... well, I guess you have a point. If these are sport shoes, then a little more needs to go into the design... Hey, you are good, man!" <BR>&nbsp; The shoes were visually terrific. Very dandy and very happening, just as his research team had advised. This was the first time Freedom was entering the sports shoes for kids' segment and the plan was to put out some visually appealing shoes. Except that Pranav was now saying: "It should also work, dad!" <BR>&nbsp; "You know, the minute we do that, the shoe becomes expensive and parents won't buy it," said Rajdeep. <BR>&nbsp; "If you are making shoes for children, where do parents come in?" asked Pranav. <BR>&nbsp; "It's like this, parents are the ones who finally decide what to buy and price is usually the consideration," explained Rajdeep. <BR>&nbsp; "For you grown-ups what is important is other grown-ups. Who cares what kids want!" said Pranav, now almost angry. <BR>&nbsp; "That's not true," said Rajdeep. "Companies that manufacture for kids, be it chewing gum or ice-cream, do care about what kids want and our entire marketing effort is aimed at appealing to the child." </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="75%" colSpan=3>"If that was so," said Pranav, "you would make shoes the way kids like them. If not, why pretend they are for kids? All grown-ups are the same." <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sensing some distress, Rajdeep asked: "Something wrong today?" Pranav sat hunched up and made one more move on his solitaire board. "It's really sick, dad. I mean, it's really not fair," he said sounding very hurt and angry. <BR>&nbsp; As it happened, Pranav had enrolled for a four-day personality development workshop for 10-13-year-olds at India House. The letter said: "1.15 at the Marigold Room." Today, which was his third day, he and his friend, Kartik, had gone up to the Marigold Room, only to find a corporate lunch going on. There was no attendant in sight, no sign of their workshop. The two boys rushed down four floors to the reception, to find that the venue had been changed to the Jasmine Room. </TD>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="25%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\107.GIF"></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; "I told the lady, India House should have at least bothered to put up a notice outside the Marigold Room about the changed venue," said Pranav to his dad. "You know what she said? You must not backchat with elders!' Now you see?" he asked. "Had it been a company event, for grown-ups, I am sure there would have been arrows and stickers all over the place telling grown-ups to turn right, then left and sorry for the inconvenience. But because it was for children, they probably felt, why bother!" <BR>&nbsp; "Coming from India House, that is downright rude, not to mention inefficient!" said Rajdeep. <BR>&nbsp; "It's got nothing to do with efficiency, dad, please!" said Pranav. "Kartik said to me: Children are for fun, not serious stuff.' And Kartik has a good reason to say that. You know that TV programme he took part in and won? It was a kids special. Guess what his team won? Exerciser cycles, saris, jewellery and a blood pressure monitor! See dad? Did any one of those organisers think of CD-Roms, Lego, BSA cycles or tennis racquets? No! Kartik got saris, dad, saris! It was the pits! You call that taking children seriously?" asked Pranav.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Rajdeep heard his son out. Then he said: "That is rotten, I agree. But take it from me, there are many who do take children seriously. Companies are waking up to the truth that children are eager consumers and can influence their parents' buying decisions. We have a saying at Freedom: 'Work on kids today and, in turn, they will be devoted to you even at 60. How do you think Colgate did it?" he asked. "Did you know that of our vast population, over 35% are under 14? And what an impressionable lot! All of them chew gum, drink Coke and seek trendy shoes. They remember to tell mom 'Moov laga!' Why, you told me I should buy Electrolux's washing machine and get a Samsung TV free! That was the day I told Aniruddh Bari, my marketing head: You must work at moulding their psyches.' So, there are many marketers who really respect children and are making efforts to get reciprocal respect from them." </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="20%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\108.GIF"></TD>
<TD width="80%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; "I am not sure," said Pranav, now warming up to a chat with his father. These were the chats he loved the most, the ones where Rajdeep discussed his work. "Yes, now they are making lots of products for children," continued Pranav. "But when I go out to buy the product, I don't see any of that respect. Like the workshop. India House even called you up to tell you how terrific it would be for me to enroll. All of us got excited. Then what happened? Just agreeing to buy is not enough. Do they respect me even after I have paid for it?" he asked. <BR>&nbsp; "I guess you're right," agreed Rajdeep. "But you know once he has sold the product to you, the marketer loses control over you, the buyer. Ideally, that shouldn't be, but in reality, thereafter, it is left to the retailer, or in this case, the service staff to ensure that the buyer continues to be delighted." </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are only two people who take children seriously, even respect them," said Pranav. "The boys and girls at McDonald's and Pizza Hut. You know how nicely they talk to us? As if we were grown-ups. Like this guy at Pizza Hut would come up to me and say Hi, you are back!' It makes me feel so good. Like he is being a buddy. I feel respected. Even when I give my order, he will listen to me attentively and say, may I repeat your order? If it had been any other restaurant, the man would look towards mom to check if what I ordered was okay by her. But not at Pizza Hut. Not at McDonald's. That's why we kids go there often, because they make us feel that we know what we want." <BR>&nbsp; Rajdeep was amazed at how much children noticed, imbibed and absorbed. Like most 12-year-olds, Pranav was attentive to his environment. "Some day Pannu, you will make a great marketer, I am sure," he now said. "So, listen to this, we say the act of consumption is not over after the product has been bought." <BR>&nbsp; "Doesn't apply to kids, dad," said Pranav. "During the cricket season, there were these chewing gums offering cricket cards. Chotu and I bought them using our pocket money, just to collect the cards. But very often we found the shopkeeper had given the best cards to the kids he knew and we were left with rubbish cards. Now, that's not fair! We are kids, dad, how can we go all over town finding the right shop?" <BR>&nbsp; Rajdeep could see Pranav's point. Was it enough to put cola and gum for kids on the shelf and believe you had served your target audience, wondered Rajdeep. There was a huge process between the retail and the child's stomach that played a role in the consumption process. Did marketers care to find out if their product left a happy after taste with the child consumer? "You know, in America, where Andy lives, they actually respect children," Pranav went on. "And you know, the kids are also quite bold and outspoken. No one tells them Don't backchat'!" <BR>&nbsp; Andy was Rajdeep's nephew who was visiting them. Pranav explained how they had been to a supermarket and Andy had said something clever. "Mom let us buy MilkyWay, the flavoured milk. She said, we should check the expiry date," narrated Pranav. "The pack said May 99' and the expiry message said, 'Use within 120 days of date of manufacture'. Andy told the manager: Why do you have the manufacturing date as a month when your expiry date is in days?' But he's allowed to speak his mind. In the US, they listen to kids. I wish I was like that." Rajdeep looked at his son's big innocent eyes and felt a certain sadness. What right did the economy have to unload so many goods on children when it did not empower them to demand? Worse, many of them were using children as a vehicle to market their products, communicating with them on family air time, because they knew that children imbibe advertising keenly. Even worse, many of them even proudly averred that children were the best advertisers for their products, even if it was shaving foam or mosquito repellent. <BR>&nbsp; He recalled what the head of a car company had once said: "The aspiration you see in a child's eyes speaks volumes for the brand attributes. You won't need anything else. Use children liberally. Put words in their mouths, build dreams in their hearts and put it all on TV if you want the profits rolling in." <BR>&nbsp; But what about sensitive advertising and marketing, wondered Rajdeep. It's splendid that you know that children imbibe advertising keenly. But that puts an added responsibility on you, the marketer, to be careful in your communication, specially when the target audience is children, he thought. <BR>&nbsp; Only last week Rajdeep had witnessed the power of advertising on his little boy. They had been to the club and after a swim the boys demanded an ice-cream. Rajdeep's seven-year-old, Chotu, his head barely reaching above the ice cream counter, hollered: "I will take an F-stick." Rajdeep's wife, Sarla was annoyed. "Not that one, it is not good, take Millie," she had said. "Why not?" protested Chotu. <BR>&nbsp; "Why not?" Rajdeep had echoed, surprised. "Because," she whispered, "it is indecent!"&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; "But he is just seven!" argued Rajdeep. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="71%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; "Yes," said Sarla, "but soon he'll be 14 and when he understands what else that could mean, he will think, these things are okay with mom'. No Raj, there has to be some limit." she said. <BR>&nbsp; But Chotu was adamant. As he looked towards his dad for help, Rajdeep said: "Chotu, we will let mom decide."&nbsp;&nbsp; "No!" said an agitated Chotu. "I am going to eat the ice-cream, na? Shouldn't I decide? And who says it is a bad ice-cream? It comes on TV and all the big boys eat it, I have seen the ad! And big boys also drink Coke and so do I. So, what they can do, I can do too!" <BR>&nbsp; "Cool it, Chotu," said Andy, "you are not a big boy anyway." <BR>&nbsp; "Who says?" yelled Chotu bracing for a real fight. "I'm a big boy, my dad says so. He lets me choose his shaving cream!" <BR>&nbsp; Andy picked up Chotu on his back and said, "OK big guy, what shaving cream did you buy for dad?"</TD>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="25%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\109.GIF"></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Chotu, pleased with the attention said, "Gillette! No dad?" and broke into a toothy smile. "And what else?" asked Andy, deftly putting another stick of ice-cream into Chotu's hand and moving away from the battlefront. "I got mom her shampoo, Wah se Wow! No mama?" asked Chotu, reaching out for his mother's hair. <BR>&nbsp; That battle would rear its head again, Rajdeep knew. Marketers knew exactly how to mesmerise a child, because in business all was fair. Chotu, at seven, knew all the ads, frame by frame, lisping every ad along with the voice over -- even enacting many, like the Ice-Ice baby ad. This was a country which had no means to prevent damage to a child's psyche. Air time was not regulated, visual communication was not adequately censored. Usually, the realisation came after the damage was done. And when a child was like Pranav, the messy marketer had lost a consumer forever, he knew.<BR>&nbsp; So he said to Pranav: "Son, don't let advertising mislead you. If as a consumer you don't like what you get, if you don't feel respected, go right ahead and lodge your protest." <BR>&nbsp; "And who is going to hear?" asked Pranav. "When the consumer is a child, he can't protest. And what do you mean by respecting children'? When I go to a department store with you or mom, and I ask to see a Timex watch, the sales man says: 'See through the glass, that's enough' and he walks away. Would he say that to you? Children look good in ads, dad, not in real life. And in ads, they make kids say and do things which in real life they won't be caught dead doing. Remember that Indian ad for Cartoon Network which showed Indian kids making silly faces at the camera? Those kids looked like a bunch of idiots. Indian children are not like that.''&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp; Rajdeep laughed. "Children are very effective in promoting a brand, Pannu," said Rajdeep. "When we use children in advertising, we know the brand is sold. Today, you have TV which is the greatest hypnotist, compelling children to choose Pepsodent because it is a dentist inside a toothpaste. You loved that ad, didn't you? You even told mom: 'You must get me Pepsodent'. Companies like that take the child consumer seriously." <BR>&nbsp; "What's the point?" asked Pranav. "You think because one kid goes on TV and says Use Pepsodent' all parents will let their kids buy Pepsodent? Never! Only if the parents believe in Pepsodent will they buy Pepsodent for the kid. Otherwise, we use what the parent uses. Why, you and mom use Colgate, so Chotu and I use Colgate too. C'mon dad!" </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="20%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\110.GIF"></TD>
<TD width="80%" colSpan=3>"That's different Pannu, mom is just wary of making a change," said Rajdeep. "See, it's like this, she has used Colgate all her life. And she makes most of the buying decisions, since she handles all that. Very often she places orders on the telephone. The point I am making is that the message has reached you, whether you buy Pepsodent or not. Isn't that correct? And that is what I mean, companies are aiming at children like you who watch TV two hours a day and they put their ads exactly on those programmes that kids are prone to watch. In short, they are out to make a good impression on children."<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Pranav grew thoughtful. "Yeahhh..." he said thoughtfully. "I remember one... L&amp;T... remember? The one where three boys are travelling by train and each is boasting about his father? Then this kid points out to various things outside the window and says: My dad built those... and those and those...' " Then Pranav laughed. "You know until then I used to think Larsen &amp; Toubro made tubelights!" </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Rajdeep joined in his son's laughter. "But you were also much younger then. Amazing how much you remember! And you noticed that ad because it had children in it. But that's the point! You, a child, noticed and remember the company. And companies strive to leave lasting impressions on young minds, because today's child is tomorrow's consumer." <BR>&nbsp; "Dad, you make it sound as if companies that sell to kids have kids on their mind all the time. I don't think so. Do they think of kids when they write to them?" asked Pranav. <BR>&nbsp; "I don't understand," said Rajdeep. <BR>&nbsp; "I will tell you," said Pranav. "Remember the time when Chotu wrote a joke for Bag O' Chips? They sent him a letter to say, we enjoyed your joke and all that and a surprise is enclosed for you. But there was no surprise. So, I wrote to the company and told them no surprise was enclosed. You know what they wrote back? You bought a pack of Bag O' Chips and that it did not contain the hologram stickers.' Can you imagine!" said Pranav sounding incredulous. 'So, we are sending you four hologram stickers...' I mean, that is a lie! All pretense! Mom said these were standard letters. Chotu was so annoyed. He said: 'God, man, these guys have got it all wrong!' <BR>&nbsp; '' Right! thought Rajdeep, they have got it all wrong! He now looked at his son with renewed interest. What idiots these marketers are, he thought. It is not enough to simply manufacture products for children if you are not going to see them through to their consumption. When you are targeting children you have to go all the way and ensure the quality of your targeting is 100%, in your dealings, in your responses, in your promotions, in your point-of-sale material... all that should be borne in mind is that it is the child you are addressing. <BR>&nbsp; From product design to product presentation to communication, to the way we feature a child in an ad, it must be linked to the fact that he is a serious target segment. Why don't they remember that children imbibe every motion, every act from the brand, and hence, are likely to misinterpret even body language? Do these marketers go to the retailers, watch them serve children, talk to children and find out what makes them unhappy about a product? <BR>&nbsp; These advertisers had just about got the mailing address right through their targeting. Having reached the consumer's doorstep, they were fumbling with their parcels. Some left it to innocuous middlemen to deliver the goods, some appointed bored grown-ups in the garb of service staff to unwrap the goods, while some didn't even bother if the child liked what they had sent, whether the child was delighted, whether the child was likely to come back for more. </TD></TR>

<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="20%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\111.GIF"></TD>
<TD width="80%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; <B>ANAND HALVE</B> <EM>is a member of chlorophyll, a Mumbai-based brand and communications consultancy.</EM><BR>&nbsp; The case raises several issues about marketing and communicating with children. Let me focus on the key issues, but first a note of explanation: Throughout the piece, I will use the definition of 'kids' as eight to 14-year-olds. (I believe that from 15, they are proto-adults, at least in larger cities.) <BR>&nbsp; If children are being considered a consumer segment in their own right, then all guidelines that apply to marketing to any segment should apply. Having said that, though, it is necessary to look at what makes this segment different from other segments. These differences exist because of the ways in which children process information and the weightages they assign to different variables. These are likely to be different from the ways in which adults act. Let's consider some of these aspects: </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Reference set: The first thing to appreciate about marketing to kids is that they hate being called kids! (There is some evidence that after the age of six or seven there is a significant change in the way they look at advertisements.) Therefore, the reference group that eight to 14-year-olds look at is not their peer group but their older siblings i.e. the next higher age band; perhaps, 16 to 19-year-olds. Enough signs of this are visible in 11-year-old girls trying on their older sister's lipstick, tottering about on mummy's stilettos and dressing up for parties, or in 12-year-old boys wearing jeans after school, talking cool' or looking in the mirror for the first hair on the chin. This desire to act grown-up and be accepted as such is accompanied by an acute consciousness of their inadequacy in terms of experience and knowledge. They are, therefore, sensitive to, and resentful about, any cues that suggest that they are just children. This is an underlying concern at all times. Marketers need to be aware of this in developing any aspect of the marketing mix.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5><A target="_parent" class=punch>Kids resent cues which suggest that they're just that--kids. Marketers need to be aware of this in developing any aspect of the marketing mix</A></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;Product evaluation: The first point at which children get evidence of whether they are being taken seriously is in the product design itself. What they are looking for is " the same thing adults get, but in my size". Compromises on any features are reminders of a reality they wish to avoid. This explains Pranav's reaction to the design limitations of the sports shoes. But there is one more aspect of children as consumers which needs to be understood. This is the nature of their reactions . Rather than the continuum of reactions of adults which stretch from poor to so-so to satisfactory to good to wonderful, children tend to have polarised reactions which flip between fantastic' and the pits'. This is an important thing to note, because it underlines the fact that in addressing children as consumers you can win -- or lose -- only by a knock-out; there are no 'winners on points'. If you lose once you won't get a second chance.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="70%" colSpan=3>&nbsp;&nbsp; Service: The child's reaction to the absence of signs at India House is an indicator of another way in which children wish to be acknowledged. As in the case of adults, children too expect service which is congruent with the situation. So, if one expects to be left alone to browse in a bookstore and fawned upon at a restaurant, so do kids. The disappointment or dissatisfaction with the cricket cards is not, to my mind, an issue of dealing with children but about how to manage such schemes. <BR>&nbsp; Price: While this is not an issue specifically raised in the case, I think it is important to note that pricing has even more importance in the case of products bought by children (compared to those bought for them by their parents). This is because the sense of limited funds to satisfy several wants is higher in a segment that does not have its own earning' and depends on others to provide these funds.</TD>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="30%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\112.GIF"></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Content of advertising: The issue of what is suitable content for messages targeting children is a matter of concern across the world -- from whether the massacre at Columbine High could have been avoided if there were no Quake and Doom computer games to rating systems for movies. The only comment I would make on Sarla's reaction to Pranav's choice of ice-cream is: "What did you expect?" After all the commercial appears on prime time TV. If she finds it offensive (as I do), the best course is to exercise her right as a consumer and lodge a protest with the makers of the commercial. One other point regarding communicating with children -- they smell a fake a mile away. If anything rings false, children will notice it. <BR>&nbsp; Influence on adult product choices: We have seen a growing role played by children in decisions related to adult' products in recent years. I believe there are several reasons for this. One, the relationship between children and their parents is more equal than in the past, and children's views are not dismissed out of hand. Two, given the keen interest with which they imbibe the content of messages they are, often, better informed (brand MNO has real fruit pieces or brand DEF TV has auto-colour balance). And finally, I suspect that many parents indulge the child by accepting his or her brand choice out of a sense of guilt at not giving them enough attention. <BR>&nbsp; To sum up, I would say that the key issues in marketing to children are no different than in marketing to any consumer segment. We need to remember that if the Cadbury Dairy Milk ad remind us that there is a child in every adult, this case reminds us that there is an adult in every Pannu and Chhotu.</TD></TR>

<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; The reasons: the Indian child's limited exposure to, and consumption of, any form of entertainment and the non-working status of most mothers, which led to the protective and closely monitored upbringing of their progeny.<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; Today, the likes of Pranav are exposed to more hours of TV programming in one day than Rajdeep had as a child in 5 months. The impact of satellite TV on the psyche of the Indian child and its moulding of him into a discerning, knowledgeable individual on a par with his age counterpart in any part of the world cannot be underestimated. With more and more mothers working, the kid's emotional dependence on his parents has also diminished. With access to worldwide lifestyles, news, technology and products at the click of a button, Pranav cannot but be smart, aware, intelligent, eager and true to his generation. And, therefore, demanding of respect as a consumer. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5><A target="_parent" class=punch>In our rush to tap another market, we should not thrust the child into the role of a consumer.</A> </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Having said that, I feel that catapulting the Indian child to the level of an economically influential consumer group presents a somewhat one-dimensional profile. Smart, knowledgeable and information retentive, yes, but equally, materialistic, deal-seeking, self-centred and indulgent. That's not necessarily true. On the contrary, it perpetuates an image that we, as parents, marketers and media-men have ourselves created. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="75%" colSpan=3>&nbsp;For parents, with their accelerated lifestyles, over-indulging children, materially, may have been a way to compensate for the lack of quality time with them. For marketers, and admen, kids, like puppies, may have served as ornamental accessories to attract attention in a cluttered market, irrespective of the relevance of the product category -- what I call the "creative bail-out". And mediamen, in their urgency to attain TRPs, may have ignored that, over four-fifths of TV-owning homes are still "one- set households." Kids watch the same programmes (and ads) that their parents do, encouraging marketers to adopt a "catch-all" strategy that neither differentiates between target groups nor questions the relevance of a creative execution. In our rush to tap into another potentially-rewarding market segment, we should not deprive the Indian child of his innocence by thrusting him into the role of a consumer. This is not marketing sacrilege.&nbsp; </TD>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="25%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\114.GIF"></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Most TV-advanced nations have broadcast policies that regulate programmes and ads beamed at times when there is likely to be a large kid audience.&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp; Most developed nations have a code for ads targeted at children. I quote: <BR>"No ad is allowed which leads children to believe that if they do not own the product advertised they will be inferior in some way to other kids or will be ridiculed for not owning it." <BR>&nbsp; "In an ad offering a free gift, a premium or a competition for children, the main emphasis of the advertisement must be on the product with which the offer is associated". <BR>&nbsp; There are even codes for children featured in ads: "Situations in which children are to be seen in ads should be carefully considered from the point of view of safety...children should not appear unattended in street scenes... should be seen following traffic rules...should not be climbing high places..." <BR>&nbsp; Let's try and remember there is more to Pranav than his pocket money and his pester power. </TD></TR>

<TR>
<TD width="92%" colSpan=4>&nbsp; Shirish Deol studied the drooping figure of Gautam Tolani who stood before him. At 28, Gautam, a director of the Tolani Group (TG), had tried hard to don the mantle of director with conviction, periodically wearing his Texas University tie to drive home his academic proficiency.&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; But today, everything had failed him. At the restructuring meeting six months ago, on the advice of Bradley Byars, their management consultants, TG had consented to exit the cables business. Yet, six months later, Lala Girdharilal Tolani, the owner of TG and Gautam's father, was suggesting they should acquire Texoll Cables. Early in the week, an executive committee -- chaired by Shirish, the CEO of the group -- had vehemently resisted this, but Lala Girdharilal was set on it.<BR>&nbsp; Shirish had joined TG a year ago to spearhead the Rs 1,800-crore business. He was reluctant to work with a family-managed group (FMG), fearing interference and restricted independence. But it was Anup Dey, the partner of Bradley Byars, who had allayed his fears. "This is no ordinary group. Besides, they are committed to their plans and promises," he had said. <BR>&nbsp; The last year was devoted to the restructuring plan -- hiving off unviable businesses, restructuring capital, the organisation structure and hiring staff. All was hunky-dory, until the reversal of the decision to sell the cables business, Meful Cables. But what bothered him the most was the desire to acquire Texoll. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; "Acquiring a business like Texoll is tricky," said Shirish. "Texoll is a successful firm, and it comes with plans and targets which have to be met in order to sustain its equity. We are not just buying assets, but a going business and its markets. Therefore, if we buy Texoll, we have to create added value to substantiate our decision to acquire and merge it into our business," argued Shirish. <BR>&nbsp; The senior Tolani had just nodded. Then as the board waited reverentially for his words, he said: "I understand. But everything will fall in place. You don't worry, just go ahead as we have discussed..." </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; But Shirish persisted. "Acquisitions are doubly expensive," he said. "We have to start from scratch, building a new identity, new culture, integrate the workforce, rationalise markets... And while we are doing all this, we also have to run our existing businesses as a more successful one. We will have to prove that we have become better. And better is not simply the increased sales that is expected anyway, but an increase in performance over and above what is built into our value. It is like starting a new business. With all the stress and strain of restructuring, can we afford all this?" asked Shirish. <BR>&nbsp; "These are small issues," said the senior Tolani. "We have the wherewithal to manage all that." <BR>&nbsp; "But what about the monetary resources?" asked Gautam. "Wouldn't it come from our existing resources? Won't it strain our current plans? Won't we be diverting monies which would have gone into other businesses?"&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="75%" colSpan=3>&nbsp;"Do we know if such a diversion of resources will benefit the original business, Meful?" asked Shirish. "Or the new business, Texoll, or the combined business? Or even the overall economics of the restructuring plan? Do we know anything at all for the Rs 1.5 crore we are paying?" At that point, the meeting had broken up for a meeting among the family directors.&nbsp; And now, the proposal was a decision. What transpired at the meeting was difficult to say, but looking at a despondent Gautam, Shirish knew the young man had fought hard. He himself felt a certain frustration. How was he, the CEO, to manage a decision he was not party to? <BR>&nbsp; Shirish met Anup that noon. They were to discuss the shortlist of candidates for the chemical business' new R&amp;D unit. "What's the latest on Texoll?" asked Anup. <BR>&nbsp; "Girdharilal is going ahead," said Shirish. "He's convinced TG needs it." "And you?" asked Anup. "You don't appear convinced." </TD>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="25%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\117.GIF"> </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; "I am concerned about the way the group is moving on this plan," said Shirish. "You tell me they have made quantum changes in their strategic thinking. But Girdharilal's control is still very strong. The approach and mindset do not appear to have changed much." <BR>&nbsp; "But don't judge the situation too harshly," said Anup. "The family's involvement will continue the way it does, for a while. Girdharilal is clear about consensus management but this instance may be different since he seems to have a viewpoint on the acquisition. I have been working with them closely for three years now and I know that he realises he has to change some of the things they are doing. The pressure on them from the economic environment is high. They are viewing the competitive pulls rationally and are making serious attempts to adapt." <BR>&nbsp; "The change I am talking about is a complete change in the approach to business and thinking," said Shirish. "The whole attitude. Change, not because there is competitive pressure. Change, not because of internal pressure, but because your vision changes. That is a different quality of change," said Shirish. "Of course that is happening," said Anup. "You can see it all round you. So many FMGs are now initiating the change process..."<BR>&nbsp; "But look at the smaller groups. Have they changed?" asked Shirish. <BR>&nbsp; Anup, who had been working closely with a number of FMGs, could see what Shirish was getting at. "Change in the minds of owners are of two kinds, and fear is the common denominator," he said. "There are hard changes and soft changes. Take MNC-driven compensation practices. Tolani was reluctant to increase salaries. Now that is a hard issue. The world typically sees that alone and makes a judgement on the softer issues. For instance, Tolani's reluctance to pay generously might foster the impression that he does not want to yield control. The correlation is not that simple," said Anup. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Shirish knew how hard Tolani was on increments. "If he has taken the decision to hire from MNCs, he must realise that the expectations of these managers are not going to change," said Shirish.<BR>&nbsp; "Just as you expect owners to evolve, Tolani as the owner also has an expectation from professional managers," said Anup. "Till the managers come of age and have the ability to lead the business, they have to learn to manage the expectations of owners." </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="22%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\118.GIF"> </TD>
<TD width="78%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; For Shirish, who came from an Indian MNC, the learning he brought with him was that the success of a company can usually be attributed to the quality and empowerment of its managers.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; "But how many CEOs can be true entrepreneurs?" asked Anup. "Do you have the same attitude to risk that Tolani has an owner? Are you willing to assume ownership for the risks you take? Or do you just want to be an employee-CEO, where you come with a platter of options, backed by some complex number of tables that point to a financial decision, with the ability to implement it? Does your heart feel the anxiety of possible failure? You know the attitudes here are very different. You could be a top-drawer manager from the world's best management school. But are you a top-drawer entrepreneur? </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;&nbsp; Is your attitude to risk as healthy and dependable as the owner's? When you are the CEO of an FMG, there is a tremendous entrepreneurial style and risk-taking ability that is needed, the decision-making capability needs to be highly entrepreneurial. Do you come with that training? No MNC, however successful, can impart that training and that is the risk these owners are taking when they hand over charge to a professional manager, can't you see?" <BR>&nbsp; "But do they also empower to that extent?" asked Shirish. "Risk-taking goes with empowerment." <BR>&nbsp; "Empowerment is not the issue," said Anup. "Where Indian businesses fail is in creating processes that manage empowerment. Why, even in MNCs, where is empowerment absolute? There are checks and balances just as in FMGs. Except when FMGs do that, you wonder if there is an anxiety to hand over control. You have business development managers in Nestle, in ITC, in Levers, but is control absolute? Isn't there a process that governs empowerment? That's what FMGs do too. Except, that their processes are not structured.<BR>&nbsp; "Let us understand," continued Anup, "Tolani as the owner would like to hand over management to a team of professionals, given some safety nets: if his money is safe, if it grows above the average rate of return and three, he derives social value from that. If he is sure of these three things, why should he or any other owner mind letting go?" <BR>&nbsp; Anup did not see much difference between FMGs and MNCs in the way their decisions were taken. "Consider the subsidiary-parent company relationships of MNCs," he said. "Don't they try and assess the risk of the subsidiary's decisions, just like the owner in an FMG does? What is the difference? Parent owns stake, parent wants to assess risk, parent denies permission to take certain decisions... and that is what the owner in an FMG also does. There you have parent-owner and managers, here you have Indian owner and his mangers."&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; "The difference being that when you talk of an FMG, there is an underlying pessimism surrounding their structures and processes," said Shirish. <BR>&nbsp; "That is because, when you talk of decision making in an owner-managed company or an FMG, it is typically a single-man decision," pointed out Anup. "In MNCs, the decision-making flows from a group of men -- the board. It is more democratic."<BR>&nbsp; "MNCs also have their processes standardised across countries,'' retorted Shirish, "Their ability to manage business with the correct processes and efficiency is known, documented."&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="75%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; "Those businesses are process-led. Thus, MNC dictates come out of rule books, in FMGs, they come from the owner's head."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; "You need to differentiate between owner-managed and family-managed companies," said Anup. "Take the example of Sundram Fasteners -- Suresh Krishna is the owner and the CEO, and he is doing a fabulous job. For that matter Bosch, Perfetti, Seagram are all owner-managed companies. Microsoft is an owner-managed firm. The problem arises when the company is managed by a family, a group of people with multiple egos. In owner-managed companies, you don't have the complexity of multiple egos, no clash of opinions."<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Shirish wouldn't agree. At TG, there was a clash between the owners and the professional team. "Then what am I doing there?" he asked Anup. "You have hired a CEO, now allow him to run the business!"</TD>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="25%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\119.GIF"></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;Which you are doing for the better part, Shirish," said Anup. "Lala Girdharilal has gone along with most of your decisions. Yes, this once he has vetoed you completely. But that can happen anywhere! Girdharilal is trying to drive shareholder value, very much like the managing director of a widely-held company. The only difference is that the owner also has a personal stake in the business by virtue of his shareholding. <BR>&nbsp; "So, in effect, he is the manager as well as the shareholder. At one level, he is trying to maximise his shareholding, and at another he is also managing the shareholding in order to maximise the same value. Now even if Tolani hands over the management to a professional team, won't his interest in maximising his shareholding value continue? So it isn't all that different from working in an Indian subsidiary of a foreign firm." <BR>&nbsp; "The difference," said Shirish, "lies in the interference in the management process. Of course, one million GE shareholders cannot interfere on a daily basis. At best, a few can yell at an AGM. But in a closely-held company, they can interfere with the brand of tea that is served to interfering with a decision like an acquisition at the cost of the future value to the business." <BR>&nbsp; "And the difference also lies in the strength of the processes that go behind such a decision," continued Shirish. "Therefore, to what extent are FMGs actually plotting the real potential of the business? Do they assess, How much can I really be worth? Is what I am doing optimum?' This is what professionally-managed, widely-held companies are doing. Because they do these exercises, they know the gap between where they are and where they aspire to be and they work at bridging this gap. Whereas in FMGs, there is a lack of academic skills, and given that succession is hereditary, the person at the helm of affairs is not necessarily a direction setter. <BR>&nbsp; "Therefore, do I have the confidence that management debates are based on scientific management principles, backed by academic knowledge or simply a function of an emotional tug-of-war? Fundamentally, that is what contributes to the dilemmas and dichotomies that present themselves in FMGs. For instance, when there is an opportunity to buy out a business, there are two factions operating, one saying yes, one saying no. In such a situation, you the CEO are caught in a family war or power struggle.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="29%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\120.GIF"></TD>
<TD width="71%" colSpan=3>&nbsp;"When I am faced with such a situation, I do not know how to lead that company. In fact, am I leading or arbitrating? Remember I have to be in the good books of both factions. Who is the direction setter here? Me? No, I am the direction suggester, I provide a menu of options, I provide a swot analysis of every suggestion, then I have to accept the final decision. <BR>&nbsp; What finally comes to be is the owner's vision, which need not be optimal. The decisions Lala Girdharilal is trying to impose are not suited to the group's growth. My desire is to maximise shareholder value, and that cannot happen if his decision prevails." <BR>&nbsp; Anup could see Shirish's agony. But he was seeing miles ahead. "Don't forget that Lalaji's objective is also the same as yours -- maximise value," he said.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;&nbsp; "But does he have a gameplan to do that?" asked Shirish. <BR>&nbsp; "He may not have what you are expecting to find. But what he has is entrepreneurial instinct, which you can never eliminate from a total business management process. That's where the mismatch is -- entrepreneurial instinct versus process-controlled intelligence. Where the chief executive has both, chances are he will fit extremely well. And the ability to build the bridge across these two sets of competencies is what defines success. An entrepreneur like Tolani might sweep aside your laboriously crafted sheets of numbers and columns. A professional manager says, 'Look, I have done this, DCF calculations, swot analysis, weighted average and so on... I spent 12 days on it...' But Lalaji says, 'Beta, yeh sab chhodo, tumhara dil kya kehta hai?' What is your gut feel? Lalaji operates on gut feel, which may seem unscientific. Mr Manager operates on scientific strategy and management school theories. As they say, one operates from his mastak, one from his pustak. Both have their merits. Both could be right. How do you build the bridge?'' <BR>&nbsp; HE continueD: Now both decisions may have opportunities. But how is one to know which is right? Who knows? Look these are not insane people. It is just that you and I don't know what frenzied calculations, if at all, happen in their mind. But something is happening. When Lalaji says 'Buy Texoll', remember those are his one and a half crores. His money. So he is not doing it for fun. Therefore, what should be the mix of instinct and analysis? I don't know. But the mix varies from situation to situation. You must know how to manage the mix. That should be the working relationship between the owner and the manager and the bridge is the understanding of how both variables work. When these two things happen, you have a happy marriage.'' <BR>&nbsp; He cited an example from his experience. "You know the automobile industry has been performing disastrously. But take Hero Honda. It grew by an astonishing 45% in the six months over the previous year, whereas the industry figures for growth are nowhere near that. Hero Honda is an FMG by definition, run by a professional manager. Take tractors. The entire industry grew by 4%, Mahindra &amp; Mahindra grew by 16%. If you go through these examples you will find all kinds of relationships and management issues at play." <BR>&nbsp; "Are you saying that these were due to professional management?" asked Shirish. "Or that the professionals did not make any difference because the instinctive management processes are so well tuned in at the top?" <BR>&nbsp; "It is, I would say, the terrific synergy of native instinct and modern intelligence," said Anup. "The processes of arriving at that success is different in both places. In one case, the owner is a hands-on manager, in the other case, he is not. Both companies have defied industry norms with their success. In one case, the owner and the manager have learnt to live together and synergise their respective traits. In the other, it is the case of empowerment and letting the manager lead. There are so many factors at play, factors of professional management and factors of instinctive management. Which one led to what cannot be pinpointed, but what can be said with confidence is, both managed the diverse issues capably. To advantage."</TD></TR>

She is also a trainer and a consultant and draws from Vedanta, Zen and Taoism to develop culturally-relevant practices.<BR></I><BR>&nbsp;Organisations need to take strategic decisions to survive business pressures and maximise value. The way strategic decisions are taken in organisations, and the processes involved in gaining support for the same, is important. TG, in a bid to professionalise, has hired Shirish as a CEO, who after a year finds that the strategic decisions are getting arbitrary. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;What are strategic decisions? These are long-term plans to maximise value, and value is defined by the owner's vision of where he wants the business to go. Professionals like Shirish would also have the best interest of the company in mind as it is part of management ethics they acquire through education.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; So, where is the problem? It lies in the two different paradigms that are being used to process knowledge to arrive at a decision. Shirish is operating from the logical positivist, scientific rational paradigm that was heralded as enlightenment and the age of reason in Europe, and is the basis of innumerable scientific marvels the world has seen. This paradigm acknowledges only empirical data that can be subjected to the scrutiny of scientific methodology and can be categorised, compared and measured. Reality comprises system of abstract ideas and concepts, symbols arranged in linear sequential structures before it can be assimilated. Fritzof Capra, a physicist, calls it relative knowledge as opposed to absolute knowledge. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5><A target="_parent" class=punch>&nbsp;Shirish needs to understand that his operating paradism is not helping him in the present situation and he must look for a new way</A>&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Eastern philosophies like Vedanta, Zen and Taoism accept knowledge that is intuitive and directly experienced - a more complete representation of knowledge. This includes the lower order empirical apara vidya amenable to scientific enquiry and the higher order knowledge para vidya that can be consciously realised through methods of inquiry like intuition, meditation, insight and indirect symbolism. It is believed that knowledge makes quantum leaps if it transcends the lower empirical mode. The cause of Shirish's consternation is that Giridharilal's intuitive mode of decision-making is not compatible with the postulates of the scientific paradigm.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the Vedanta, institutional consciousness, anubhava, wisdom acquired through experience, is a valid source of knowledge. Being the owner, Girdharilal is invested as a complete person in the business - physically, mentally and spiritually. He is likely to go beyond the empirical and draw greatly from anubhava, while taking decisions. This Shirish cannot understand. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="76%" colSpan=3>&nbsp;The scientific paradigm of knowledge is also neutral and value-free, hence, it informs more than it transforms. Thus, we find the CEO wants to implement changes at TG but is not open to change himself. He wants TG to become a learning organisation but is he a learning CEO? Girdharilal has agreed to pay huge MNC salaries, a major change in attitude, but Shirish is unwilling to even look at Girdharilal's decisions. He is worried about the undemocratic way in which the decision has been taken, even though Western research has conclusively shown that decisions that are arrived at through group consensus are not always the best and that individuals are often capable of superior problem-solving and decision-making. The case clearly juxtaposes the elitism of modern, western, scientific education with the eastern, traditional, familial and indigenous. </TD>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="24%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\122.GIF"> </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Vedanta has a number of lessons for making learning transformational. The first step is to rid the self of certain mental and emotional attributes that act as barriers to knowledge: viparaya. These are raga - desire to own more power even at the cost of usurping it from others; dvesha - anger and contempt; moha - attachment to own viewpoint as being superior and avidya - ignorance. The TG CEO displays ignorance of higher forms of knowledge. Shirish displays egotism and attachment to his paradigm which makes him rigid.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; So, what should Shirish do? He is experiencing stress and this will jeopardise his effectiveness as the CEO of the company. Shirish first needs to realise that his operating paradigm is not helping him in the present situation and he must look for a new way.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Vedanta prescribes sravana, manana, and nidhidhyasana, a three-stage sequential method of acquiring knowledge. Sravana means to listen or absorb information without judging or evaluating it. If Shirish considers Girdharilal as less than himself, he will find it difficult to listen. Manana is contemplation or application of reason and logic to remove doubts. This is Shirish's strength. The last stage, nidhidhyasana, comes after all intellectual doubts have subsided, a stillness through meditation results in a direct experience of understanding and realisation.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; If the CEO incorporates the more holistic eastern paradigm of knowledge, which includes scientific enquiry, he may actually find Lala Girdharilal's decision reasonable. Even if he discovers the contrary, the realisation will be accompanied by calm and conviction and not the distress he is experiencing now. </TD></TR>

This is not surprising since Shirish's experience primarily has been with multinationals where processes are well-defined, well-structured and transparent. On the other hand, Girdharilal's decision-making process does not match what Shirish construes as the correct decision making process. Just because he doesn't see a process, he assumes that there is none.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;Apart from the factors that the consultant Anup mentions, in most family managed groups (FMGs), the CEO is vested with powers on strategic matters only after he has earned the trust of the owner-investor, especially if the CEO has come from an alien culture. What constitutes the basic elements of trust-building may vary from organisation to organisation, culture to culture. At Tolani group, rather than discount his non-FMG experience, Girdharilal would like to assess the CEO's capability in the new environment.<BR>&nbsp; But one thing is critical - the chemistry between the CEO and the owner-investor. If the chemistry works, trust builds faster. If it doesn't, it may take a string of successes before the owner begins to trust the CEO. </TD></TR>

The case mentions that the restructuring plan was going smoothly except for the reversal of the decision to sell off the cables business. Broadly, Girdharilal's decision to acquire Texoll's cable business is in consonance with his earlier decision not to exit the sector.<BR>&nbsp; The chief executive must actually spend more time trying to understand the owner's decision. Is there some aspect of the business that could have been overlooked by the consultant? Is Girdharilal worried about the timing of the decision? Does the owner have any strategic interest (other than emotional) in this decision? These and several other related questions need to be explored by Shirish to facilitate a true management process. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="70%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; Thirdly, Shirish does not seem to have looked at the true 'scientific' reasons for the Texoll decision. Shirish's job was to navigate the Rs 1,800-crore business, and he seems to be getting upset over the Rs 1.5 crore that is being paid to buy Texoll. He seems to be concerned about the overall economics of this operation and also feels left out of the decision-making process. The correct stance to take would be to assess the impact by conducting a thorough analysis that can then be used to support his argument.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourthly, Shirish must use Gautam Tolani as a very effective bridge between himself and Lala Girdharilal. One of the secrets of successful professional managers in family-owned enterprises is the ability to find some suitable method to get a point of view across. </TD>

<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; If the manager is sensitive enough to perceive that an idea will be better accepted if it is seen as coming from someone whom the owner already trusts, then he must use that resource skillfully. In the present situation, there appears to be a fit case for such a move.<BR>&nbsp; Lastly, if even after all the above steps are initiated in the organisation, Shirish still feels strongly about the decision, it is too early for him to throw in the towel. Shirish must look at himself as a harbinger of change not only in the organisation but also in the way Lala Girdharilal looks at things. If, and only if, he does this can, Shirish claim to be a successful professional manager.&nbsp; </TD></TR>

<TR>
<TD width="94%" colSpan=4>&nbsp; Aadesh Saxena looked with surprise at the spread on his house guest's breakfast plate. There were two chapatis, a bowl of vegetables, a cup of dahi and a boiled egg. "How can you eat this meal at 7 a.m.?" he asked Om Vasisht, a marketing consultant, and a close friend of the Saxenas.&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Om looked down at his plate and said, "It is quite light, and very nourishing too!" Aadesh tucked in his napkin as his tray of cereal, fruits and eggs arrived. "You must eat cereal," he said. "So I am," said Om, pointing to the chapatis, "except bigger and rounder!"<BR>&nbsp; Aadesh who was the marketing head at Energee Foods, shook his head. "You obviously didn't notice these boxes of Healthee wheat, corn and rice flakes," he said. "At least when you are my guest you must eat what my company makes!" <BR>&nbsp; "Oh, I gave up milk six years ago," said Om. "In any case, I am sure there are enough people out there who are doing Healthee a lot more justice."<BR>&nbsp; And that is what Aadesh was not sure of. Energee Foods manufactured a range of ready-to-cook and eat foods and instant foods for breakfast, brunch, lunch, tea time and dinner, including instant dosas and idlis, baked beans, jams and canned cooked vegetables. Cereals was a growing market and was perceived as occupying a significant share of the breakfast table. Consequently, last year Energee added cereals to its portfolio.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="75%" colSpan=3>&nbsp;&nbsp; But research findings this year were far from encouraging. Healthee was being bought but not as often or as much as expected. Detailing parts of his research, he said to Om: "We found that convenience foods have a maximum chance of succeeding in the breakfast slot. Even there, for those who eat cereal it is not a total meal. They eat a bit with their milk, but that is to wash down the milk. Kellogg's describe cereal as the complete meal, but what is it completing? The per unit consumption is not what we would prescribe for a full breakfast."<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; "But that will be so," said Om, "because it can never replace the vast repertoire of breakfast foods we usually eat. You cannot change the eating habits of a people because it is governed by the climate, the culture, what grows, the lifestyles, the affordability... everything." </TD>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="25%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\127.GIF"></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Om, in his research, had found that when it comes to food and eating, there were a variety of segments -- varying from time as the limiting factor, to nutrition, convenience and taste. "Let's look at different kinds of consumers, look at each set's breakfast or eating habits. For example, how many eat breakfast at 7 a.m.? For example, the housewife who is busy with getting the kids. At that point will cornflakes satisfy her? Or is she also reaching for a paratha with pickle? The issue is not what you want them to eat Aadesh, the issue is what are they eating anyway? Don't try and only change habits. Stay with current habits and fit your products into those slots. Simultaneously evolve their habits and allow your product range to evolve therefrom." <BR>&nbsp; "Tell me, " said Om, "Did you adopt one single position? A single position works, you know."<BR>&nbsp; "What position?" asked Aadesh. "Within breakfast I adopted the convenience slot. Kellogg's has occupied the breakfast slot, and that is what cereals are coming to be seen for. It has already called it a breakfast food; naturally I am also calling it a breakfast food. But it didn't exactly set the Yamuna on fire. The bottomline is: I don't get a good feeling about our sales. Dealers are buying, but not enthusiastically, consumers are buying, but there is something to consumer attitudes and behaviour. Our research shows that the number of families buying are as per our expectations, but not their volumes. I feel there is something more which we haven't identified." <BR>&nbsp; "Okay, let's look at your positioning then," suggested Om. "The whole idea of positioning cereal as a breakfast food, as a complement or a supplement to the traditional Indian diet, was predominant in your mind. Now the mix that an average Indian eats is most complete in most contexts already. So the niche that you have selected is a narrow one which is where the problem comes in. Why do you think it is a breakfast food?"<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, at that hour people are in a rush to get to office or school," explained Aadesh. "So we said it can be quickly had. Besides, it is light and nutritious and healthy. We discovered that the rush segment doesn't eat anything anyway, and the non-rushed segment already has a full meal, for whom this breakfast slot is not a valid slot at all." <BR>&nbsp; "Even the rush segment," continued Aadesh, "while it does consume cereal, and claim it is a healthy diet, does not eat a full cereal breakfast. The add-ons vary from a paratha roll which is eaten on the way to the bus stop or in the car, to a cheese sandwich or a bowl of fruit.<BR>&nbsp; I also feel, to a large extent that time defines what they will eat. I know one family which has always eaten Champion oats for breakfast 'because it is filling', and suffered the resistance of the kids or the vast quantities of sugar that goes into dressing up the oats. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="20%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\128.GIF"> </TD>
<TD width="80%" colSpan=3>These days they add generous quantities of Frosties or Chocos to the porridge which sells better with the kids. So on days when the kids get up late, the oats is eliminated and it's just Chocos and milk." <BR>&nbsp; "You didn't realise that in India it is used as an additive to milk,'' said Om, "and, therefore, unwittingly pitted yourself against Bournvita and Horlicks! So, what then is the role of the cereal?" asked Om. "Breakfast? When I think about it, I don't think Kellogg's has positioned its cereal for the rush segment or for a state of rush. It positioned it as a supplement. Now who is it competing with? With the paratha or dosa, with Bournvita or Boost or Complan which is added to flavour the milk to push it down the throat easily. So where is the cereal landing up? Necessarily it is cornering itself into a position of insignificance. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;This means that if the cereal is not present on the table, it won't make such a big difference. It is incidental. Most families have a menu of options -- honey, Bournvita, oats, dalia, dosas, parathas -- all these have been conventional breakfast options. In such a basket, the cereal is an incidental come-and-go activity. By offering it as a nutritional element at breakfast or a complement to the existing breakfast fare, it is doomed to be a niche player in the basket. Do you see?"&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp; "And that is because you have put it into the breakfast slot," said Om. "Therefore by definition, once it is 9 a.m., the box of cereal is of no relevance on the table; it is not visited until the next morning. It does not return to the dining table. That's what you have to apply your mind to. By restricting it to the breakfast table you are reducing its efficacy and utility for the rest of the day. <BR>&nbsp; "Healthee should seek to be a product which has free mobility on the table, across all meals," felt Om. "Healthee should be an anytime food, in the same way in which Maggi noodles can be had at breakfast, or at lunch or as a filler or at dinner with a variety of vegetables thrown in," suggested Om. <BR>&nbsp; "How is that tenable? " asked Aadesh. "When the Kellogg's of this world are swearing they are breakfast foods, how can I come in and say, 'Healthee is an anytime food?'" <BR>&nbsp; "A food is what you position it as," said Om. "Now look at Maggi's positioning. Fundamentally, it can be perceived as a meal-time food. Instead, it is an anytime food. It is two minutes away from satisfaction and convenience. If Maggi had positioned noodles like you have positioned Healthee, it would have ended up becoming another meal. But Nestl researched and found the evening slot as the key slot to take up a position. So it became a snack food. With time, overlaps happened and people started having it at other times, as a filler, as a distraction, as a meal-between-meals and it came to become an anytime food. So the two-minute concept was positioned more as an evening emergency snack for kids and then it caught on. From 'once-a-week-Maggi' it started happening thrice a week." <BR>&nbsp; Convenience, nutrition, health were just positions to take, felt Om. "And each of these has a place in every meal," said Om, "and you have to decide on the meal slot. For that you will need to look at eating habits at every meal. The day shifts in India because of the huge trading community. So, you have a heavy breakfast which is essentially the lunch fare. Very few people actually eat lunch regularly at a restaurant. Either they carry packed food or have food delivered to them or, like the traders, eat an early 10 a.m. lunch on which they subsist the whole day. For different professions it works differently. But it is the dinner hour that is mostly pegged to 7-7.30 p.m.<BR>&nbsp; "So, where are the slots where a snacky meal can come in," asked Om, "where convenience is required, where time is the issue, where the meal has to be light. These are the slots for your cereal to fit in. What I am saying is that you don't necessarily have to position Healthee as a breakfast food." Aadesh resisted that. "You can't change something so fundamental!" he said. "Let us look at what you have," persisted Om. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="75%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; "You came in with cornflakes because you believed the Indian habit was changing in that direction. Have you examined current eating habits?"<BR>&nbsp; "The point is, Healthee, or for that matter any cereal, while it is being bought, isn't becoming the core breakfast item on the table," said Aadesh. "Because there are any number of substitutes."&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp; "I think there's another reason linked to the product that it's to be had with, namely, milk," said Om. "You can't, for instance, have cereal with dal, though I wonder why not! It's all a matter of serving and positioning it. Come to think of it, Maggi is essentially a commodity. You can have it the way the manufacturer prescribes or do your own thing, with Maggi as the core and garnishes of vegetables, minced meat or eggs.&nbsp;&nbsp; </TD>
<TD width="25%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\129.GIF"> </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;&nbsp;"But as I said, the suggestion of the how to' has to come from you. Since it has to go with milk, there are any number of substitutes -- cocoa, Bournvita, Rooh Afza, chocolate or rose syrups, and even oats. Milk goes well with so many of them. And in any case your product is only a supplement." <BR>&nbsp; Om felt it was not just a question of what to eat'. It was also a question of when to eat' that went into the perspective of planning. "Take the case of Mother Dairy's Aloo Tikki," said Om. "It is a ready-to-eat tikki, can be had anytime. But unusually, as I have seen, people examine the pack, are amazed it is ready to eat, but usually put it back because there is no message which comes with the product which suggests when it can be eaten! Strange isn't it? An aloo tikki is staple Indian diet, but the minute it comes in a packaged form, if you don't suggest when to eat it, the impetus to buy and consume it is not there. I think you need to tell the woman that she needs a ready-to-serve emergency snack, you need to position yourself into her habits -- only then does she start viewing you with interest." <BR>&nbsp; "Or take Milkmaid condensed milk," continued Om. "It didn't move when it was sold as condensed milk, the consumer received no suggestions on how else it could be used. Since in its commodity form she had not much use for it, the purchase was very limited. But once the suggestions came, and mind you, these were suggestions that fitted themselves into the consumer's habits, the purchases shot up. The same thing happened with tomato puree. It is such a fundamental ingredient, but they all said tomato made easy'. But once they started talking about good-looking Rajma, smart-looking aloo mutter, the puree moved out of the store shelves into the kitchen."Talking of habits, Om suggested that Aadesh take a look at the new habits in food preparation, storage and eating. "The newest preoccupation today is microwave cooking," he said. "For some time, the woman rejected the microwave because she was convinced Indian food did not lend itself to microwave cooking methods. But when the heating attributes of microwave began to appear overwhelming, some of them purchased it. Then arose this notion that refrigerated food is not as tasty when it is reheated. True or not, there it is. But that little bit of instant ginger paste or tomato puree when added to my reheating process is perceived as refreshing the food! It's amazing, but it is in fact true. For the fragrances come alive and the dal is no more yesterday's leftover. And this is so common to Indian households -- this whole process of re-tadka. You have leftover dal, you quietly chop up some onion, fry it in ghee with ginger and garlic and throw it into the withering old dal and, presto, it comes alive.<BR>&nbsp; So what has happened? Tomato puree and ginger pastes became generic commodities which could be used to refresh food. Essentially they enabled the housewife to reposition the old dal with a few touches to its basic personality!" </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="20%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\130.GIF"> </TD>
<TD width="80%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; Fair enough, thought Aadesh. "But where does Healthee cereals come into this?" he asked. <BR>&nbsp; "You need to learn from the evolution of these products," said Om. "Thus, you can expand Healthee's market if you also address the 'when' issue. But few marketers are doing that. Everyone who is marketing cereal is harping on the same usage attributes: health, nutrition and breakfast. No one is suggesting the 'when' aspect, and that is what is required to grow the market. If the consumer does not eat cereal anyway, Healthee will never appear on her purchase list," said Om. "But if you can find innumerable situations in her life where the cereal can readily fit itself, she will buy the cereal for those other situations too and willy-nilly also have some of it occasionally at breakfast, because it is there anyway!" </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;&nbsp; Om went back to his favorite example of Maggi noodles. "As a pasta it could have got stuck in the lunch mould, but Nestl deftly sidelined that and bravely said, 'Anytime'. And mind you, Maggi came 15 years ago, when the Indian was far from adventurous about food. Maggi's maximum consumption is between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. which is typically the time when you are looking for an emergency snack. It is also the time when you have a madly hungry child on your hands, homework done and an appetite that is soaring and your good sense is preventing you from giving him a samosa or a series of dosas or biscuits because he has to eat dinner by 7 and you want him adequately hungry by then. So what do you give him? Maggi and milk!" <BR>&nbsp; Om was of the view that the new millennium was the era for change, for innovation, adaptation, the era for creating a revolution in worldwide food habits. "You have gone into the standard mould of putting the cereal in the breakfast basket," he said. "But the issue that emerges is, are you looking at the 'when' and the 'how' and the 'how-else'? It is for you to generate the 'how elses' if you want to grow the market. For, believe me, market share can be won only by those who can grow the market, not by the me-toos." <BR>&nbsp; As far as he could see, cereals were a commodity, like noodles and tomato puree. "It is for you to create the magic with new 'how tos," said Om. "If it becomes her core ingredient to innovate with, be sure your product has entered the kitchen of every housewife for good. Your cereal has to transcend to the level of becoming an ingredient in the housewife's recipe book. Leave it to her to innovate by showing her that your product is but an add-on for nutrition and health. For that is what a cereal is ultimately. But right now you and Kellogg's are simply saying 'eat breakfast with milk', thereby restricting usage. Naturally, away from breakfast and milk, the cereal will have no salience." </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; The other issue, felt Om, was that food was being marketed and researched by men, not women. "This is a country where the woman is the predominant creator of food. She does it for a living!" he said. "When food companies leave the product research and adaptation to women, the market will grow. The way she re-tadkas the dal, or crumbles stale bread and chapatis to create a mesmerising upma, the way she alternates her rasam with lime once, tamarind the next time, tomatoes the third time... the way she stuffs capsicum with cheese rice... If you understand the poetry that food is, you will be able to write new verses." <BR>&nbsp; Om was confident that anybody entering the foods market must learn the 'how' and the 'when' and the 'how-else' aspects of food if they want to grow the market. Innovation was the key. "If you tap the actual usage of bread," said Om, "what share of it is used as plain bread vis-a-vis in other forms? The traditional form of bread is toasted and buttered. But in India you even have bread pakora, shahi tukra, bread upma... The innovation in breads over time is what is responsible for the acceptance of bread as a product in India. It is not an original Indian product, just as cornflakes and condensed milk are not. So, take your cue from bread if you want Healthee to grow," he said. <BR>&nbsp; As they got into their respective cars, Om said: " Remember Aadesh, no market share wars are won without growing the market and you can do that when you create new uses for the same product and for that you need to delve into the habits of people. In the beginning there is a fundamental habit of eating. Now go ahead and stimulate desire!" </TD></TR>

<TD width="80%" colSpan=3><STRONG>MANU ANAND </STRONG><I>IS MANAGING DIRECTOR OF FRITO-LAY&nbsp;<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;</I> Energee Foods seems to have built a solid product portfolio of ready-to-eat foods and has seen entry into breakfast cereals as a logical extension of its portfolio. In jumping into what looks like a large market, Aadesh does not appear to have thought about what his company is doing in this category. Clearly, there are natural fits in this extension, in terms of utilising infrastructure, selling and distribution systems and even manufacturing facilities. But thereafter this category is distinct from the other products that Energee Foods is into and needs to be looked at differently.&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;Given the eating habits of Indians, not surprisingly, the cereal category is small. Over time, Healthee's volumes can grow appreciably through category growth&nbsp; or else it will be limited to fighting share wars with Kellogg's and other players. Category growth is possible only through a change in eating habits, either by positioning purely as a breakfast cereal for all age groups and trying and changing breakfast habits and/or positioning as an all-time food/snack to select segments and gaining a share of the stomach post-breakfast.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; To position Healthee as a breakfast cereal, Aadesh would have to work hard to change eating habits. As a category, breakfast cereals are alien to the Indian diet. In the West, breakfast cereals play an important role in balancing the diet and providing the necessary fibre and cereal content as the consumption of cereals in other meals is relatively low. In India, cereals are the staple food for all the meals&nbsp; Oms observation that he is eating bigger and rounder cereals is valid. Most Indian breakfasts have their fair share of cereals&nbsp; parathas, puris, chapatis, poha, vadas, idlis, dosas are consumed at breakfast by most middle-class households across the country. Wheat and rice remain an integral part of the meals as the day progresses and the relative percentage of cereal consumed during meals increases as you go down the socio-economic pyramid. Cereals are consumed in forms that we have been used to eating, which go well with dals, vegetables and non-vegetarian preparations. So, why does the Indian consumer need to eat more cereal? </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5><A target="_parent" class=punch>Unless the size of the market is increased, energee will be limited to fighting share wars with other players for a share of the pie</A> &nbsp;&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Changing eating habits is a tough task, even when you have a strong argument to offer. Here the task will be tougher since the basic cereal consumption is already high. If they pursue this route, Healthee would have to appeal to the health conscious, more from the perspective of a low-calorie, low-fat way of consuming cereals at breakfast. They could also advocate it as a good accompaniment to milk and as a quick and healthy breakfast for those on the move, especially school-going children. This would be a slow process requiring considerable communication investment. Aadesh would need to evaluate the relative importance of Healthee in Energee Foods portfolio and assess its ability to sustain this kind of investment. Given the bigger players like Kelloggs in the marketplace, Aadesh may want to let them take the lead in this . </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="75%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; The other option as suggested by Om is to take the consumption of cereals beyond breakfast&nbsp; to make this a fun-to-eat category yet retain core nutritional values. As a result of the current position of the category, cereals are today seen only as a breakfast food&nbsp; as serious eating from a nutritional perspective, with overtones of convenience. It isnt seen as a snack or as an option for a quick meal. There are clear opportunities available to someone who can come up with a differentiated product&nbsp; a product with an appropriate taste and form to appeal to the target age groups and eaten with different accompaniments. The Indian consumer can be adventurous in trying new products, provided that the pricing is in line with their perceived value. Here it has many choices. </TD>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="25%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\132.GIF"> </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;&nbsp;One option would be to target cereals as an all-time consumption food/snack for children&nbsp; a product that can be eaten at breakfast and can be carried in tiffins boxes and eaten dry, eaten with milk on return from school or play, and even as a light meal or meal substitute or with milk much before bedtime. To appeal to children, its taste and form would need considerable innovation&nbsp; exciting flavours apart from chocolate and strawberry would need to be developed and the shape made more exciting. Communication would need to be woven around this as fun for children, yet reminding mothers of its nutritional values and convenience. To ensure convenience, pack sizes would need to be different for home consumption and other occasions where smaller, single-serve packs could be effective. As these children grow up, Healthee would need to hold on to this habit, making cereal consumption a part of their daily diet. <BR>&nbsp; Another option would be to try and work on the concept of a meal substitute for all age groups, consumed with items besides milk&nbsp; options like a 'Healthee' lunch of cereals and yoghurt etc. Here again the task is one of changing set habits and it could be easier to focus on teenagers, appeal to their sense of this being the 'cool' thing to consume and over time build the consumption habit. The product availability should shift to make this available at outlets like school/office canteens. Whichever option Energee pursues, Healthee's long-term growth will only come through a major category expansion, which is likely to be long and slow. Good luck, Aadesh. </TD></TR>

Having established its brands during the era where market shares were more a function of share of licensed capacities than inherent strategies, the option of diversifying ones portfolio is based on identifying high potential growth categories. Unfortunately, this creates the twin challenge of both selling the product concept and facing strong competition. Energee's move into the cereals market represents such a diversification. The market has a high potential but is small today and has a Kellogg's to deal with. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; There lies the positioning dilemma. The price-based positioning does not generate enough cash to sustain market expansion efforts and a head-on battle with international giants reduces the market share significantly. The situation is further compounded by a bewildering choice of alternative positions, none of which may individually represent an attractive enough segment. The Delta Habit Factor (DHF) framework can provide a perspective to evolve a strategy under such circumstances. The DHF model postulates that successful brands have an inherent ability to alter consumer habits around the use for the product category in terms of either creating new uses for the product, or changing the frequency of use of the product or changing the duration of use of the product or changing sharing habits of the product or changing buying habits of the product. Since Energee already has existing successful products, it has, by implication, developed an internal indigenous competence to change habits. The trick lies in leveraging the existing habit change competence to identify the relevant positioning slots for oneself in the new product category. </TD></TR>

<TD width="100%" colSpan=5><A target="_parent" class=punch>The trick lies in leveraging the existing habit-change competence to identify relevant positioning slots in the new product category </A></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Energee must consider existing products on the one hand and new category positioning options on the other to evolve selected positions in new categories. Existing products like ready-to-eat dosas, idlis and vegetables, essentially catered to existing product categories (since dosas, idlis, vegetables already existed) and focused on making these categories more convenient. The habit changes for these products were all along the dimensions of the following habit factors, namely, changing the occasions of use, changing the duration of use and changing buying habits in terms of source of buying. Energee thus has developed an indigenous competence to alter habits along the convenience dimension for its existing product categories. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="70%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; &nbsp; Notwithstanding the small size of the existing cereal market, the positioning slot open to Energee can be based on its previous competence in changing habits, that is, to provide the convenience linked to time saving/occasions of use to existing categories of food, both cereal and non-cereal. On mapping existing consumer food habits, Energee has to bring greater convenience to both the cereal and the non-cereal market. Seems impossible? Consider these options: <BR>&nbsp; A more convenient form of having breakfast cereals than Kellogg's. This isn't impossible: for example, sachet packs, or spray-dried, milk-coated cereals, which need water as an additive and not milk. These and more such positioning platforms that would be consistent with Energee's competence are more the choice for it. </TD>

This would leverage Energee's habit change competence on dimensions of occasion and time saving.

<TD width="92%" colSpan=4><A target="_parent" class=punch>When megalin India acquired Neocooler, it also took on 15 members of the old sales team. But that led to the perpetuation of certain questionable practices.</A></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="92%" colSpan=4>&nbsp; Pritish Guha looked at the dealer report before him. Fourteen dealers across Delhi and UP were uniquely demanding identical conveniences from Megalin Ltd. Bill us by all means, but we wont take delivery. Pritish was the sales director of Megalin India, manufacturers of an international brand of refrigerators. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;&nbsp; Early in the year, Megalin was offered the plants of Neocooler India, which was closing its refrigeration division, on condition that Megalin also take on the divisions sales and technical staff.<BR>&nbsp; While Megalins then country manager, Karl Fitzgerald, did see that as advantageous in a new market, he had said: At this stage we will take on 15 salesmen and the remaining 35 at the end of the year. Failing which Megalin was to bear the cost of retiring them. <BR>&nbsp; As the year-end approached, the rush to clock targets assumed a frenzy in a market where innumerable brands, both Indian and foreign, were vying with one another to offer price-offs and free gifts. It was in such a market that Megalins sales team, which now included the 15 Neocooler men, confronted dealers who would not take physical delivery. <BR>&nbsp; When Debu Moitra, a senior area sales head, sought Pritishs consent to book forward sales (sales that will occur next year but the credit for which would be taken this year in the books), Pritish winced. I dont see what is wrong, said Debu. At Neocooler we periodically accommodated our dealers. We must understand. The dealer doesnt have the warehouse space to keep products; but for sales tax and excise reasons, youve to move the stocks out of the company godown. All we need to do is hire another godown, where the billed stocks can be held. <BR>&nbsp; Pritish wouldnt hear of it. That is downright illegal! he said. Besides, Megalins worldwide code of ethics does not permit or recognise such sales! </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="75%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; Debu, an erstwhile Neocooler salesman, had gone back to one of his dealers, and regretted his inability to accommodate him. An annoyed Vashiram Gupta of Careware Appliances had said: Then go and tell your foreign bosses this is India, yahan aisa hi hota hai! Now Debu was considered top-drawer material, ever since he had managed to push a lot of Megalin into the market within six months of his move from Neocooler. <BR>&nbsp; He had homed in on all the Neocooler dealers and convinced them to add the Megalin product to their stocks. To Guptaji, for instance, he said: For all these years you bought Neocooler from me, now I am bringing to you Megalin, you must take some. After all, we have a 15-year relationship...&nbsp;</TD>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="25%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\137.GIF"></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;And with some more persuasion, many dealers like Guptaji had consented. What Debu achieved in the north soon became a template for his colleagues in other zones, and soon Megalin joined the clutter. <BR>&nbsp; While the initial offtake had been heartening, the new rot caused by the unusual demand was spreading. A desperate Pritish decided it was time to speak with Megalins new managing director, Vasudev Datta. Sales achieved thus are not sustainable, advised Datta. It is too early to pursue numbers, Pritish, when we havent yet sold the brand! <BR>&nbsp; Pritish was nonplused. Every season lost is shares lost, he said. Have you seen how LG, Samsung, Electrolux are working the markets? They are everywhere! <BR>&nbsp; Megalin is so different that no existing rule book will apply to it, said Vasudev. There is a difference between then and now, between Neocooler and Megalin. When we bring a world-class brand like Megalin to India, we are bringing to the table a change in manufacturing processes, features that deliver a lot more value. When we created Megalin abroad, to sell those new features and concepts, we followed it up with an integrated change in the marketing approach. We have now entered India, not to compete with existing brands but to launch a revolution in refrigeration. The core value of Megalin is vastly different from that of Neocooler or any other refrigerator. And this is what most new entrants forget. <BR>&nbsp; When they come to India they are in a quick-win situation. A distribution system is difficult to set up in India, so the best thing to do is poach, borrow or steal manpower from Videocon or Godrej... They get short-term quick results. Thus if the core mission of Godrej was building relationships with dealers, the strengths of its sales force will be related to the strength of the dealer relationships. When you get that sales force over, you get very good dealer relationships. But your core value which you are trying to transfer is subsumed in the process, because the guy who has been hired thinks he has been hired for the same value and he has to prove it. <BR>&nbsp; How do you say he was hired for relationship-building? asked Pritish. <BR>&nbsp; Wasnt he, when your thrust on entering the new market was to get early-mover advantage, hire people who know the local markets, understand local networks? asked Vasudev. Knowing that relationship-building takes time, what that sales force lands up doing is nurturing the same old relationships with an intent to transfer to them a share of the new brand dealership! <BR>&nbsp; What is wrong with that? asked Pritish who felt Megalin needed all those and many more relationships. Cant you see that the only value he is thus taking to the dealer is that relationship and in the process limiting your market share? So Debu of Neocooler plays his relationship card and gets all his old dealers to stock Megalin also. But you, Megalin, are trying to enter the doors of dealers and consumers with a different core value. Say, freshness of food thanks to a new technical feature. At the distribution point, from the company to the dealer, that core value or message is not getting communicated, because it is still a relationship issue! Do you see my point? asked Vasudev. And that is why my advice from day one has been, desist from taking on the Neocooler sales team. We dont need it.&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="20%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\138.GIF"> </TD>
<TD width="80%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; But we already have on board 15 of them, said Pritish. Then cut your losses Pritish, said Vasudev, or the rot will be unmitigable. The salesman is the conduit to the dealer and the end consumer. That is the point at which you must seek to transfer the new core value to the consumer. Please note, Guptaji has taken 10 pieces of Megalin not because he has seen value in a new product feature but because he knows Debu of Neocooler and has known him for 15 years. In the process you are creating a whole wedge in the sale process. Instead, if you had a sales man with a fresh mind who went and sold on the new value platform, it may take some more time to get that dealership, but you have a greater chance that if and when he does take your brand he would have done so for the right reasons, consistent with your brand positioning. And he might even take 40% and not just 15%. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; All that the Neocooler salesmen have managed to do is replicate the Neocooler market share, felt Vasudev. Nobody knows what value Megalin has brought to refrigeration. You believe you have increased sales by 4% since the new team has come in, but understand, the incremental value you have sold is essentially cosmetic features like the quality of the paint, the design of the doors etc, but not the core value - increased freshness. That new value is not being talked about in the sales process. Nor is it being perceived by the dealers. That core value cannot be transferred to a salesman hired from Neocooler. Thats the bottom line! ended Vasudev.<BR>&nbsp; Relationships were critical to brand building, agreed Vasudev. But the initial dent that you made on the market isnt born out of the value that your fridge keeps food fresher than the others, but because Debu knew Guptaji very well and also a host of Sharmajis and Varmajis and he managed to make 15% wedges everywhere, he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So what you have got is fundamental trials at the dealer level. A Gupta stocking 15% of Megalin refrigerators is not going to convert into your entering the ultimate consumers home. Gupta will no doubt move and push his stocks, be it Videocon or LG or Megalin with the same spirit, because to him, all refrigerators are simply that - stocks. Look at what he does - when he pushes a Megalin, he does not say: This one will keep your food fresher. He will say: Modern hai, badiya hai, achcha company hai, no complaints received so far, achcha chal raha hai... all very nebulous statements. For, realise that if he says this is the only fridge that keeps food fresh, he cant sell his Godrej.<BR>&nbsp; The real transaction occurs at the retail level, where the knowledge is transmitted - there my frontline sales force has got to have a new attitude and new focus. Instead, it is hired for its old experience! That is the mismatch, said Vasudev. <BR>&nbsp; Pritish would not agree. Debu has really worked very hard on the market. Making a dent on such a highly volatile market is not easy.<BR>&nbsp; And what card did he play? asked Vasudev. Did Gupta buy Megalin because he saw just the fridge his customers were looking for? Or did Debu even sell him the Megalin core value? Does Debu himself believe that Megalin is vastly superior and different from Neocooler? Debu sold Gupta Neocooler but physically delivered Megalin!<BR>&nbsp; Naturally Guptaji insists that Debu make such a deal possible for him on the new brand also. Bill by all means, but I wont take delivery. Understand, at Neocooler, part of the basis of the relationship, of that network, has been managing this. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="71%" colSpan=4>And it was there to see. In areas where the sales team was new, such a practice did not take shape, because there was no historic relationship which dictated the new market dealings, reasoned Vasudev. <BR>&nbsp; Simultaneously, the areas managed by the ex-Neocooler team were faced with the same problem. They are perpetuating a bad practice born out of nurturing relationships. The brand will not benefit. It will be bought for a fundamental administrative convenience, said Vasudev. <BR>&nbsp; In the durables market, he felt, apart from advertising, the core values of a new brand could be transmitted to the ultimate consumer only through the dealer. Unless and until I have converted the dealer, I have not converted the consumer, said Vasudev. If at this stage you have a dealer like Guptaji who is stuck in the doorway because of his old malpractice, there is no chance that he is going to imbibe the new core values and transmit them to the consumer. </TD>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="25%"><IMG SRC="my project_images\139.GIF"> </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Vasudev said he was talking out of experience. Before he took over the reins at Megalin, he was the director, marketing and operations, at Belmont Cosmetics, a global Indian cosmetic company. What I learnt is that when you are trying to build a new marketing network, you must first assess how much experience to buy into the system and how much newness, he said. <BR>&nbsp; Wait a minute! said Pritish. If you do not buy experience, where are you going to get your sales staff from? You certainly cannot hire new new! <BR>&nbsp; Why not? asked Vasudev. How much time does it really take to put the new staff through the mill, to build the experience? Three months on the outside! <BR>&nbsp; And where will real market knowledge come from? asked Pritish. You are a foreign brand, you have little knowledge of the complexity of Indian markets. Entering with an all-new team is akin to a blind man looking for a black cat in a dark room! <BR>&nbsp; And in all probability, continued Vasudev, there is no black cat! Or, a black cat is not what you should be looking for in the first place! Instead you go ahead and put in place a strategy for something that you dont need! And that is exactly what happened at Belmont, he said.<BR>&nbsp; As it happened, Belmonts core value and mission was total solutions-driven skin care engineered through a prescription-based selling approach. Thus you went to a Belmont skin adviser at its shop-in-shop counter and she recommended a range of its products for your problem. That was how the brand took off in India initially, making it a Rs 20-crore brand. <BR>&nbsp; Now, having created a positioning based on the prescription method, the brand wanted to triple its sales. That is how the company hired 15 salesmen from Lyla Cosmetics, a large skincare company. Now what these new men did was to examine their old companys network of 5,000 outlets and 10 distributors, whom they hired immediately, thereby replicating Lylas template.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; When I examined the distribution network of Belmont, said Vasudev, I found that these distributors also carried Lylas skin range and were selling Belmont in much the same way as they sold Lyla! As against Belmonts prescription selling, Lyla was mass retailing. Thus in the Lyla model the retailer would stock six of Lylas products and the consumer would buy, say, just the age defier.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Consequently, when the new sales force took over, it would go to a retailer and sell him six of Belmonts products. They simply did not understand total care, said Vasudev. &nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; He continued: They did not even appreciate that a fundamental retailer who also stocked Sil Jams and Grihani Imli did not have the time or the inclination to do prescription selling. And when Belmonts sales plummeted, the sales force threw up its hands and said: At Lyla we had the support of a Rs 7-crore advertising spend. Since you do not have such support, we cannot perform. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; So, borrowing the sales force resulted in selling the values of mass availability that went with Lyla, through the relationship. That was the focus of the sales force, said Vasudev. They had made a fundamental error in assuming that to grow, Belmont needed the experience of the brand leader, hence they imported its sales force! </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="20%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\140.GIF"> </TD>
<TD width="80%" colSpan=3>&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead of refreshing the retailers approach and converting him to the prescription model, the dealer himself got mesmerised and continued to buy into the a la carte selling method. That rot spread as the consumer, instead of getting a complete solution, a prescription, was left to decide which of Belmonts products to buy. Not realising that what she needed was a range of products for her ailment, she bought a single product which did not do for her what she had expected of Belmont. Disillusion was rampant naturally. In some cases, where the consumer was aware that Belmont worked as a range, she found the retailer was not offering her a prescription and she thus stopped buying at that retailer. Thus many retailers found themselves carrying excess stocks, stocks aged, and the rare consumer who did buy it wrote to Belmont saying it didnt work and gradually the equity and faith that had been built up over five years was demolished. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;&nbsp; And all because there was this rush to import Lylas experience into Belmont, said Vasudev. That was at the heart of the problem, he said. Belmont wanted early-mover advantage, but in the process the core values of Belmont which were critical to the brands growth got decimated and distorted. The initial sales pick-up blurred its vision and the team did not even see the ripple effect it was creating. <BR>&nbsp; While buying experience at the frontline, said Vasudev, a company must evaluate the kind of experience it is buying - is it really necessary and what baggage comes with such experience? Its not what I am getting from Lyla, but also what else I am getting which Id rather not have, said Vasudev. That is often a detriment to achievement. <BR>&nbsp; Pritish was deep in thought. He needed to have the remaining Neocooler team in in a month, since a lot had to be done. Maybe they could retrain the old boys, he suggested to Vasudev. <BR>&nbsp; Whatever training or retraining you might do, it is not possible to unlearn what you have come with, because these men have grown up there, said Vasudev. <BR>&nbsp; He continued: And it is not whether you spent three years in P&amp;G and four years in Godrej or 10 years in Colgate. You have simply spent 10 years in an era, in an industry which has been brought up on a different approach and attitude to the market. That very same company will find it far easier to re-adapt its existing sales force to new market demands, but you cant pick up that sales force and expect it to unlearn the old and learn an altogether different approach in a new company. <BR>&nbsp; Even if I try to change them, the dealer will not accept the change unless he has been invested with the need for change, said Vasudev. For instance, whatever change-based training you gave Debu was pointless since he was reaching out to the old relationships - Guptaji, to whom he did not sell the new brand value. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; If today Megalin was facing a rebellious dealer community it was because it had bought the Neocooler teams baggage of previous experience and learning, felt Vasudev. What happens then is that you remain consistent with the old practices, no one thinks differently, no one buys into the new core values. In effect, you end up cloning your ex-brand. Then you are faced with cultural differences, which is nothing but dissonance born out of neglecting the core value, and you are spending lakhs putting together an integration exercise to marry the old with the new, sorting out meaningless battles which are in no way germane to your new product or value, said Vasudev. <BR>&nbsp; So you go about adapting, adjusting... all along thinking these are cultural issues, FMC versus MNC, American versus Indian... Whereas it is simply the case of a new product or value versus the old - the experience you have bought and the baggage that came with it, the assets you bought and the liabilities that came with it. The question you must address is: Is it better to invest in training to build the assets or do I train them to unlearn the liabilities? <BR>&nbsp; The new entrants today are not seeking to gain market shares, went on Vasudev. They are here to grow and expand the market. You think an Amway wants a share of P&amp;G? These new entrants are not looking to eat into existing shares. They know that today in India, market shares are not won by fighting brand wars, but by expanding markets. <BR>&nbsp; The LGs and Samsung and Daewoos are not seeking to nibble at the existing 3 million units of refrigerators being sold by the competition. Instead, they are seeking to build another 3 million users who will be theirs. So, since we are in the market to double the existing size of the market, why are we buying the old experience?<BR>&nbsp; We have to create the new feeling, the new experience! And dont forget, we are also trying to create in the ultimate consumer a new feeling, a new attitude, a new desire for our product. In advertising I bring in a fresh approach, in production processes I bring in a new approach. But when it comes to that bridge between the retail point and the sales force, which is so critical to my consumer relationship building, I am happy with the old experience and the old attitude. That doesnt make sense! So the people who are your change agents, your sales force, cant be people with old baggage! <BR>&nbsp; What do we do? asked Pritish. <BR>&nbsp; Its clear, isnt it? Pay off the Neocooler men, hire afresh, train afresh, launch your core value clearly into the market, said Vasudev Datta.</TD></TR>

The phenomenon of reporting sales which have actually not taken place  that is, where the invoice has been raised but the goods not despatched/ delivered to the customer  is called by various names: bill &amp; hold, billed but not despatched or simply, forward sales. Such practices are nurtured by relationships which stretch the ethical boundaries of corporations.&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; When relationships lead to unethical practices, firms have to watch out as these normally vitiate the culture and lead to an overall erosion in values.&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; The fundamental issue Vasudev and Pritish are discussing is not only relationships, but also managing change in a dynamic environment. We live in an era of fast-paced changes. Companies have to learn to manage change. Failure to do so can lead to catastrophic consequences. Where are the firms which led the colour TV industry segment in the early eighties? They went out of business because of their inability to recognise and manage change. The environment in any industry can change rapidly. Change can manifest itself as:<BR>&nbsp; * A slowdown in industry growth<BR>&nbsp; * Over-capacity : downward pressure on prices<BR>&nbsp; * Change in technology, manufacturing, marketing, selling &amp; distribution methods<BR>&nbsp; * A drop in industry profitability<BR>&nbsp; * Mergers &amp; buyouts<BR>&nbsp; * A sudden increase in competitive activity </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5><A target="_parent" class=punch>The fundamental issue is not just relationships; failure to cope with a dynamic environment can lead to catastrophe</A> </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; In India, the protectionist economy of the eighties transited into the competitive era of the nineties. The country moved from the licence raj to liberalisation and from shortages to plenty. In the refrigerator industry in the mid-nineties, capacities got built ahead of the curve. Combined with recessionary conditions, this forced companies to rethink their strategies. Mergers and buyouts became common. In a category such as refrigerators where, traditionally, companies differentiated their brand based on the quantum and efficacy of cooling, Megalin tried to differentiate the brand on the core value of freshness.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; The winds of change did not leave the trade unaffected. Most progressive companies consider dealers to be important stakeholders, along with consumers, employees, shareholders and suppliers. Yet, how many companies would invest or put in the effort to get the dealers on board and prepare them to face the challenges of the competitive market place ? The belief that dealers do not want to change is a myth. How can we forget increased competition? Guptaji too has competition. No retailer wants to lose a customer to another retailer. In the era of multi-brand outlets, understanding customer needs and communicating key brand differentiators can determine the fate of a sales pitch. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="70%" colSpan=3>&nbsp;&nbsp; Vasudev is right about the importance of the dealer in the selling process. While Megalin can communicate the core value of the brand (freshness) through advertising, it needs an endorsement from the dealer to clinch the sale. Advertising gets the brand into the consideration set of the consumer, but the final verdict is delivered in-store. Rapid changes can throw any company off balance. For the team from Neocooler, working for a new company Megalin would represent a major change. Obviously, the integration has not been managed well. At the outset, during the integration process, it is important to break the barriers which are built by lack of perspective, fixed mindsets, personal egos and, more importantly, an inability to understand the significance of the changes in the operating environment. Managing integration is a challenge for any company. </TD>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="30%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\142.GIF"> </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; It would not be advisable for Megalin to cast away the former Neocooler team. Relationships are built over a period of time and have to be continuously nurtured, especially in a competitive environment with new players in the market. On the contrary, relationships can be positively leveraged to break the barriers to change and facilitate the brand-building process. Barriers can be overcome through a well thought out training and communication process. Such a programme within the company will not only help align Debu Moitra and his former Neocooler team with Vasudevs vision but would also facilitate their integration into Megalins culture.<BR>&nbsp; The new members could act as catalysts to change. Laggards, if any, can be separately dealt with. A dealer-training module is a natural extension of this philosophy. In the interim, Megalin could deploy company-trained sales promoters in critical outlets to facilitate the process of change. The Guptajis, Varmajis and Sharmajis will need no convincing once the new methodology is successfully demonstrated in their store. The process would need to address the requirement beyond integration as change is continuous. Megalin will need to constantly update skills and build competencies in the team in order to continuously improve the level of execution in the ever-changing market place.<BR>&nbsp; Visions seen only by leaders are insufficient to create an organised movement or significant change in the company. Vasudev and Pritish need to inspire the team and enlist it in their vision for Megalin. Teamwork and collaboration are absolutely critical for its successful execution. Managing this process is a leadership challenge for Vasudev and Pritish. They need to own it and drive it within the organisation.&nbsp; </TD></TR>

<TD width="80%" colSpan=3><B>Jeswant Nair</B> <I>is CEO (sales) at Marico Industries.<BR><BR></I>&nbsp;Strategy must drive structure and staffing. Or conversely, structure and staffing must support strategy. In the case of Megalin Ltd there seems to be a clear strategy as articulated by Vasudev Datta, the present managing director. However, one can debate whether the strategy is the right one given the context in which Megalin finds itself.&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Refrigerators have penetrated around 8.4% of the total Indian households, as opposed to TV which has achieved a 31.2% penetration (source: Indian Readership Survey 1998). To that extent, Vasudev Datta is right in arguing for market expansion. The key issue facing Megalin is whether the strategy outlined by Vasudev Datta is being executed as desired. If not, what part of Megalins actions have contradicted the strategy? And, what should Megalin do to rectify it? The strategy of the former managing director in acquiring the plant capacities of Neocooler does not seem to be in sync with that being espoused now by Vasudev Datta.<BR>&nbsp; It would appear that Datta inherited what the former managing director had begun to put in place. Both Pritish Guha and Debu Moitra seem to be in some dissonance with Dattas point of view and more aligned with the strategy outlined by the former managing director. The next issue to consider is whether the dealer network for refrigerators and other appliances is passionate about product quality features (real or cosmetic), as a prime driver for pushing a brand. By and large, dealers are more interested in comparable product quality at a competitive price that will drive product volumes and that need minimal after-sales service. Once these needs are reasonably satisfied, dealers are more interested in margins, followed by quality of service and marketing support rendered by manufacturers. All of the above being more or less equal, dealers would not like to recommend or push one brand over another.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5><A target="_parent" class=punch>&nbsp; The mere existence of superior product quality, excluding all else, isnt a sure recipe for volumes.</A></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; They would rather leave this aspect to advertising for generating customer demand and enquiries. Even if they tend to push a brand over another, it would be for considerations other than product features and quality. This reality seems to be lost on Datta, even as Guha and Moitra seem to emphasise these in different ways. Dattas strategy of growing market share and volumes, through detailing of the superior product features via the Megalin sales force rather than the trodden path of dealer push and relationship management, begs support in terms of staffing and structure. Strategy, structure and staffing must be seen as a cohesive whole. Datta has extensively argued about the weakness in staffing that will jeopardise strategy. He has, however, not looked at the distribution model that is likely to deliver strategy. Datta quotes the case of Amway ...market shares are not had by fighting brand wars, but by expanding markets. What he fails to mention, however, is that in order to do this, Amway has a completely different model of delivery system, structure and staffing.&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD width="67%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; A traditional dealer network, fed on relationships and margins, is hardly going to change behaviour only because there is a different story being told by the Megalin sales people. Advertising has a major role in generating customer demand and enquiries which, when supported adequately at the point-of-sale, completes the buying decision. Only a part of the point-of-sale effort is the role of the dealer. Apart from inducements and incentives that will motivate him to push Megalin, he must also not be short on conviction.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; To that extent, the role of the sales force in demonstrating product superiority and capability becomes paramount. The mere existence of superior product quality to the exclusion of all else, is, however, not a sure recipe for volumes or a guarantee of extra dealer interest.</TD>

<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Relationships do matter and cant be ignored. Datta appears to take an either/ or view on the quality of staffing. He seems to be entrenched in his belief that product superiority can far outweigh a tradition built on years and years of relationship management. Relationship management must be the foundation on which the product superiority story must be told. The sales force of Megalin, whether from Neocooler or elsewhere, should be trained both in its conviction and in its capability to demonstrate product superiority and this should also be transmitted at the point-of-sale through appropriate demonstration. But all this can happen only if the customer is favourably disposed to the brand which advertising needs to deliver. Datta seems to paint all the Neocooler sales people as having been brain-washed in the old paradigm of only relationship management.<BR>&nbsp; This may only be partially true. Firstly, there would be people who are re-trainable and who might be looking for a challenge to sell products qualitatively. Guha and Moitra must, therefore, strongly advocate a process of selecting amongst the 50 and build a team with a blend of old and new. They must then embark on a process of re-training and training followed by market audits of whether that which is trained is transmitted. Dispensing with the Neocooler team may well be a case of throwing the baby out with the bath water. Datta must factor in the cost and time involved in paying off the Neocooler employees and hiring and training afresh. Finally, there is an issue of ethics where, one way or another, artificial sales are created in order to report healthy sales volumes and growths. Megalins clearly articulated code of ethics is right and Dattas position of clean sales is a clear and unequivocal message that must bear out in practice.&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR>
<TD width="92%" colSpan=4>&nbsp; Priya Verma stood shell-shocked. The Post-it on Prateek Khannas door, from his wife, said: Hope, you had a good game. Its my turn now, I am leaving. Half surprised, but mainly worried, Priya turned to leave, when suddenly she noticed Khanna step out of the elevator with his golf-kit. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;&nbsp; Uneasily, she greeted him, and waited as he read the note.&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; There was no way out of the situation, she reckoned. Im sorry, said Priya. I had told Latika that I would drop by for lunch... I am sorry, she repeated herself, Can I help? Khanna, looked down at the floor as he crumpled the note. He gesticulated helplessly, unable to say anything. She must have gone to her mothers house. Let me go and talk to her... said Priya.<BR>&nbsp; An hour later, Priya met Latika at her parents place in suburban Mumbai. Latika was composed. Prateek says he is too old for parties, too tired to drive into town, too busy to watch a movie. I am tired of fighting his resistance. Tired of getting him to unwind. He doesnt even play golf. He works at it. The only two things that drive Prateek are his sales and his shots. Every situation is about either the clock or the calendar. Must get back, must get there... thats his reference point. He must get to bed early, because theres work to attend to, once he gets there, he cant come back because there is work to do. And when we are together, he is tormented by the promotion that is delayed, by the money he could earn if he were elsewhere, by the shares that crashed instead of rising, by the house he should have bought... all kinds of things. Prateek doesnt know what to talk with me. You know, he doesnt let go. It is getting to me... <BR>&nbsp; Three hours later, after getting an assurance from Latika that she would return home, Priya left. She was presenting a paper at the millennium meet organised by the New Executive Forum the same evening, and had to get back, she explained. However, she couldnt take her mind off the incident that happened in the morning. So, she was delighted when later that evening Ved Bari, the head of Bellvue Hygiene Products, had sought her table to have his evening dinner. Ved had delivered a lecture on his favourite subject, The New Indian Consumer, which drove away all the residual anxieties of the day. <BR>&nbsp; Priya, an organisation behaviour specialist in private practice, was accompanied by Kshitij Rajan, one of her senior consultants. Now, look who has been listening to my lectures! said Ved, as he gave Priya a warm hug. Priya laughed. Dont be modest Ved. As always, youre a pleasure to listen to. Such depth, such detail, and so much research! she said. Rubbish! said Ved. Its just the sort of nonsense my work puts me through day in and out. Tell me about your work, what have you been doing? Her response froze on her lips, for walking towards them was Prateek Khanna. If Priya was taken aback, she did not show it. Gregarious, eloquent and dramatic, Prateek took centrestage, unwittingly catching the attention of the press photographers. Kshitij watched as Prateek posed and quoted, while Ved listened attentively. Later, as they were driving home, Kshitij said: The two are a study in contrast. I was expecting Ved to dominate the conversation, instead it was Prateek! Is that how Ved is usually?<BR>&nbsp; Yes, said Priya. When he is delivering a lecture, he consumes his audience, but put him at a table with four others, hed much rather listen. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="75%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; Prateek was a natural! said Kshitij. Hes fantastic. Such fabulous experience! Terrific things keep happening to him. Everything he says is so spectacular and exciting. Its almost unbelievable!<BR>&nbsp; He is a man with great experience, said Priya. Of course, he has his way of garnishing them!<BR>&nbsp; Kshitij was silent for a while. As they were turning the corner at Marine Drive, he said , You know, such a person can fictionalise everything. Do you believe all that he says?<BR>&nbsp; Priya smiled. Depends on the issue, she said. Frankly speaking, Prateek does get away with a lot. Minor stuff really, but he does have the tendency to dramatise. Its part of the life he lives. A marketing man to the core. Twentyfour hours a day, hes indulging in making his consumers believe in the fantasy that his ads spin. </TD>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="25%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\147.GIF"></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;&nbsp; So, I was right. All that he says neednt be true, said Kshitij. More than truth, it is a function of his perception, said Priya, which, in turn, is a function of what he would like you to believe. Even when he is describing his breakfast, he is actually doing a story board. In many ways, Prateek lives in a make-believe world.<BR>&nbsp; Kshitij looked surprised. What do you mean? he asked. Priya weighed her words, and said, Kshitij, I happen to know that Prateek is going through a personal crisis. But his presence at the meet says a lot about him. Prateek believes it will sort itself out. Or that it doesnt exist. Or that it is an anecdote in a story which can be tied up later. The world according to Prateek Khanna is painted in corporate colours, the hues of his domestic life are too dull to matter right now... thats how I see it. <BR>&nbsp; People rely on their job challenges to survive the reality of life, Priya, said Kshitij. Prateek is just one example. His corporate image is what he believes in, depends on, works at. Maybe thats what rounds off the rough edges of his life. <BR>&nbsp; But shouldnt it be the other way round? asked Priya. What was that we used to say in school, work to live, not live to work...? Dont we work so that theres a home to live in? Isnt that why we get back to our homes? Khanna goes home, so that he can get back to work.&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; People have their own coping strategies, said Kshitij. Ultimately, its all about survival. <BR>&nbsp; People are different, said Priya. Prateek is on a high these days. You must have heard he is tipped to take over as CEO. I suppose that anticipation influences his demeanour. In any case, hes like that. Kshitijs mind reverted to Ved. Wasnt Veds demeanour influenced? He was aware of the stresses that Ved faced at work. A recent organisational review he and Priya had done for Bellvue had revealed that. The general perception of his senior colleagues was: He keeps a lot close to his chest, does not share information and is unilateral in his decision-making, they had said.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Young and dynamic, Ved was hired by Bellvue when it set up shop in India in 1996. The responsibility to deliver the companys vision and targets fell squarely on his shoulders. He had hired his operating team from across three different companies and inherited a series of change management problems which Bellvue had to cope with along with problems with its joint venture partner. <BR>&nbsp; Innumerable hours were spent in managing the relationship but his team declared it was a stalemate and that Ved should call off the joint venture. Ved was not prepared to give up what he thought was otherwise a viable relationship. When Priya had pointed out that as the reason for his teams non-cooperation, Ved had said, I am aware.&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; I can neither be autocratic with them nor with my partner. Both are facing change, and both are responding in the only way they know. I will manage it slowly. All this takes time... &nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="20%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\148.GIF"> </TD>
<TD width="80%" colSpan=3>&nbsp;Kshitij found it difficult to understand Ved. But Priya said: Its not just his love for peace, he actually knows how to ensure it. Its the way he thinks. He will work around the situation gently and flock variables around till they fit! You have seen that. Remember the time his son called when we were discussing the feedback of his peers? she asked. <BR>&nbsp; Two weeks before the board examinations, the boy had lost his Physics study notes. But Ved looked at it like any other crisis. He talked to his son gently for 35 minutes, helping him jog his memory, travelling with him through the days events, auditing every move that had been made and creating a checklist of places where the notes may have been lost. It was amazing, said Kshitij. <BR>&nbsp; Just imagine! said Priya, there his son was breaking down out of sheer fright, here he was with the most serious problems at work and willing to put his sons life into order as well! </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;&nbsp;Kshitij now thought about a crest-riding Prateek Khanna and a composed Ved. How does he manage it? he asked. When life is such a tizzy for him, how does he keep his calm on domestic issues? <BR>&nbsp; Only a person with great strength of character could balance it, was Priyas opinion. You see a lot of consistency with Ved at work and at home, despite the hyped and exaggerated work environment, she said. The business environment itself is in the throes of exaggeration in one form or the other. Everyone is trying to scream louder and be dramatic. Given that external environment where marketing warfare itself is a form of exaggerated assault, and given the internal environment where a manager tries to survive his peers, his customers, his bosses and his own aspirations, Ved is like a breath of fresh air. <BR>&nbsp; And you dont think that is a put on? asked Kshitij. <BR>&nbsp; I agree, socially, what you see of a person cannot be believed, said Priya. For even there they don their corporate images. But in Veds case, even his friends talk highly of his great composure. The organisation is so overwhelming today that you will usually see gaping dichotomies in most people. I think that is at the bottom of all this. It is part of what organisations do to people today. It makes them run harder, faster, that extra mile, to reach, grab and consume the whole market. Each wants to win laurels for his company. And what each one plots in the market, creeps into his general demeanour at work. So, you have people like Prateek who can come up with anecdotes that are exciting and peppered with the impossible, despite a crisis in his personal life, said Priya. That did not affect the demands of his professional life. The flip side is that people with competitive pressures at work end up carrying those pressures home.<BR>&nbsp; I wouldnt agree entirely, said Kshitij. Take our very own Akshad Verma. He knows his appraisals are abysmal, he is working at it, but for some reason he has never been able to make a mark at work. Yet, look at his personal life, there is a certain calm there. His wife works, their children are exemplary, they swim together at my club, both are deeply into environment protection and the various meets they have... <BR>&nbsp; Yes, I have seen that, said Priya. But the overwhelming trend that we see today is that people are unable to straddle both parts of their life with equanimity. Organisations dominate people so much that there is this contradiction that is reflected between their personal and professional lives. Let me give you the example of Rajiv Satam, the head of Ribbon Foods. What do you think of him?<BR>&nbsp; Outstanding, most unassuming, soft-spoken, patient and so democratic, said Kshitij. <BR>&nbsp; Let me add to that, said Priya. When we hired him for Ribbon, I spoke to his colleagues at Teffer and Metaxx India. They were full of praise for him. The adjectives both sets used were uniquely identical. So high is their regard for him that even to this day his old colleagues stay in touch with him. And that includes his previous bosses, who call him for advice, to brainstorm, etc.<BR>&nbsp; Up to that point, Satams a lot like Ved, said Priya. But view him in the context of his home and you will notice sharp contrasts. You dont see him as helpful, warm and giving at home, said Priya. Be it his parents, his spouse, even his sons.&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="73%" colSpan=4>&nbsp; He is demanding, exacting, unforgiving. If the plumbing breaks down, or say one of the kids gets a bad report, he has no solutions to offer. Instead he tells them, Find a solution, be independent!  &nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp; Kshitij was surprised, but readily said: Either he is getting burnt out by the demands of work or... <BR>&nbsp; You know what his mother once said, said Priya. She said: He gives all the love he has within him to his work, so he has none left for the home. Only a mother can explain it in those words. But it got me thinking, Kshitij. Its a malaise of todays work environment. It requires great strength of character to survive. People who crack up at home maybe dont have the strength to channelise their energies. It eats into your vitals. I see it happening all around me and I am seeing it almost everyday. This sharp contrast in the dual lives they live. </TD>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="27%"><IMG SRC="my project_images\149.GIF"> </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; I tell you it is the demands of the organisation. The organisation puts you in a bubble, builds a goal for you and a personality to match and it trains your psyche to live and accept that. Dont you see how this idiotic performance appraisal system works? It is designed to make you see only the professional side of your life. Your whole goal and thrust is then entirely the business of achieving that status of performer. Naturally, all your energies are channelled into achieving the demands of the organisation. A poor appraisal is clearly a sign of rejection or failure. <BR>&nbsp; There is another reason for that, said Kshitij. The changing face of society itself. I guess this would apply more to men managers than to women managers. The demands on a man have increased multifold. His social environment is no more interested in only his organisational status. Today, schools, wives, children and even the media are demanding a greater involvement from the man as a father and a husband. Schools decry fathers who cannot be present for a parent-teacher meeting. Working wives haul up their husbands for not picking up their plates. Traditionally, todays generation of fathers or husbands do not come equipped with either the emotions or the skills to cope with the demands of their enhanced roles. Children want to be read to before going to bed and daddy must do it, never mind if he has a presentation at eight in the morning. Women, on the other hand, seem to take all this and more in their stride.<BR>&nbsp; Priya had by now reached Prabhadevi and the traffic jam made her groan. Switching off the engine, she said: You know, I disagree with that. Every gender has its own manifestations. I will give you the example of a school friend Nandini Mittal. A school topper, she studied chartered accountancy and was a gold-medallist. Today, she heads the financial consultancy division of a bank. Extremely diligent and an eager beaver. Her bosses dont interfere in her work. She has a free hand. <BR>&nbsp; But the feedback I got from her subordinates and peers is unbelievable. They say she is overwhelmingly aggressive, dominating, disorderly and lacks sensitivity and compassion! Now, isnt that a lot? <BR>&nbsp; One particular person told me how he had to resign over the loss of some important presentation material. For long, I have been plagued by her disorderly style, and this time I made the mistake of telling her categorically that I had given it to her. My protests didnt help, because she told me summarily, Lets not waste time, we both know you havent given it to me. She told the directors, I refuse to have someone so unreliable in my environment. And they gave in. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="20%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\150.GIF"> </TD>
<TD width="79%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; If you look at her personal life, continued Priya, then her work place behaviour is unbelievable. Her husband is a very successful business man, very warm and full of fun. Her home is beautiful, orderly, picture perfect. Nandini is a loving wife, a doting mother and very house proud! She is quite docile at home, waits on her husband, and if you didnt know of her professional accomplishment, youd think she was a nice housewife of a nice businessman. <BR>&nbsp; What do you think is happening to Nandini? asked Priya. From what I recall, at school, she is the same mild, timid person I see now. I knew her when she worked in the eighties with a foreign bank.&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; I saw none of the aggression or disorder then. In the last four years, she has transformed. Preoccupied and harried. What is also worrisome is her tendency to shoot from the hip, pulling numbers out of her hat, quoting statistics which are not researched.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;&nbsp; Kshitij was in deep thought. It is clear she is undergoing some transformation, he said. She is trying to survive... <BR>&nbsp; Thats what I feel too, said Priya. Nandini is caught in the current of todays work ethos. Shes changed at work, but not at home. She has not evolved as a person at home. Her home reflects her husband all the way. But what bothers me is how did a perfectly nice person like Nandini lose her bearings? Its the assault of todays work ethos! <BR>&nbsp; And yet in sharp contrast was Kshitijs own brother Vijit. Putting together Priyas interpretation of the world, he began to see what was happening to his own brother. Vijit was self-employed - a market analyst. Superbly efficient at work, he was often quoted as an example of perfection in the family. And that was so because of the way he was at work. His office was carefully ordered, with a place for everything. His files were neatly tagged, labelled and stored. His clients were very happy with everything - his execution, his reports, his timeliness. Not once had he been late in delivering a report. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; On the home front, Vijit caused endless anxiety. He is very warm, nice, very affectionate and all that, said Kshitij, but at home he just lets go! For one, he is most helpless. Vijit can neither put things in place nor find any of his things. His room is a big mess. He is always late for every social engagement, and not by a half hour but a full two hours. However, such a thing wont happen at workplace. Hes on time for every meeting, keeps all his appointments, remembers dates, all the tasks... But on the home front, he lets down family and friends. He doesnt remember important dates like birthdays, anniversaries etc. You know, it is as if he doesnt even notice the environment at home! <BR>&nbsp; Vijit probably sees his workplace as his only responsibility, said Priya, his personal life is the responsibility of his family. So he lets go. He has nothing to prove at a personal level. Its happening to most people today. The pressures of being a top-notch manager, to be visible, in demand, indispensable... all these are a function of the work culture, but importantly, so deep is its impact that an individual constantly lives in that hyped up state. Its a high that nothing else provides. In contrast, the home is a state of lull, and families like Rajivs have even come to accept his non-participation which also means they are managing on their own. That also contributes to the duality in personalities. <BR>&nbsp; Kshitij could see that. And yet, he thought about Ved Bari. Perfectly balanced at work and at home. Time passed by with its turbulence, but Ved was steady as a rock. Of the many people both he and Priya had discussed, there seemed to be only one Ved Bari, he rued. What did it take to resolve these conflicts, he asked Priya. Do organisations have to change their paradigm or is this going to be the way of life? Its unnerving if this is the fabric on which future society is going to be built, he said.</TD></TR>

<TD width="80%" colSpan=3><B>Jagdeep Khandpur</B> <I>is group vice-president (people development &amp; communication) at Bilt.<BR><BR>&nbsp;</I> This is an achievers world. Missed opportunities and failure to deliver results can destroy well-run organisations in no time. The rewards of success have multiplied manifold and hence, there is a lot more at stake. Winning matters corporations and businesses are evaluated on their quarterly performance and the need to deliver on or above target all the time. The pressure to perform is real and here to stay.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Managers in pursuit of performance, spend time and energy fruitfully at work, derive satisfaction from doing so and are known to have few interests unrelated to work.<BR>&nbsp;The situations facing Prateek, Rajiv and Vijit do occur and in my view have a lot to do with the organisational culture or ethos in addition to family or personal requirements as well as an individuals ability to handle stress and stressful situations. The success of an organisation depends on the performance, commitment and skills of its people. They are expected to outperform competition while also improving capability to face future challenges successfully. As managers endeavour to meet these expectations, personal and family needs sometimes take a backseat and get ignored.<BR>&nbsp; Successful organisations initiate a number of measures to enable employees to perform efficiently, for example, world-class management systems, developing performance-enabling culture, reward mechanisms etc. But not all organisations take an interest when it comes to the life of managers outside the workplace. Say, for instance, a company like Bellvue, where Ved, while at work, attempts to solve his sons problems by talking to him on the telephone. The organisations work environment provides him the flexibility to deal with personal emergencies while at work and deal with the situation calmly and in an unruffled manner.&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5><A target="_parent" class=punch>Some firms stress the importance of balancing official and personal work. Techniques like 360 degree enable managers to focus on both.</A></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Ved displays a composed and self assured manner as he deals with complex issues at work as well. Compare this with an organisation where a work-while-at-work norm prevails. In the second case, an employee may be forced to choose between work priorities and a personal emergency. Is this a desirable situation? Will it not impact the employees behaviour at work or at home? We know that there are occasions when managers forego better opportunities in terms of career options as they are seeking to balance their work and personal life. On the other hand, corporate line and HR managers lay stress on and also seek evidence of such a balance while selecting employees to work for their organisations either externally or through internal moves.<BR>&nbsp; The question, therefore, is whether a company should or shouldnt introduce measures to focus the managers mind on personal life in addition to work? The answer is firmly embedded in the organisations culture. There are organisations which stress the importance of balancing both official and personal work. It is clearly acknowledged that such a balance is extremely important for personal success as well as for growth into leadership positions in the organisation. This factor is considered an important managerial competency as much as those related to work directly. Through the application of techniques like 360 degree and other tools, they enable a manager to focus on areas requiring attention both at work and at home. This enables a person to examine both spheres together, understand the connection between them and set goals for development in both areas. As this initiative is a part of the employee development process, it is neither intrusive nor threatening for the individual.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="70%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; A message underlining the importance of building balance between work and home is clearly delivered by the implementation of such a process. It is important to understand what balance actually means here. It doesnt mean compromising interests in one area in favour of the other. Balance is achieved when objectives in both work and personal life areas are met. Performance is not compromised and delivery standards are not diluted. The approach helps a manager in dealing with both spheres of life successfully.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; This ethos is driven by a strong belief that such a balance leads to overall satisfaction with ones own self and brings about the best in people. It helps in focusing the managers mind on the deliverables and on areas requiring attention at work and in personal life.</TD>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="30%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\152.GIF"> </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; The organisation responds further by supporting the allocation of time and developmental resources to meet these objectives. The purpose of this approach is to ensure success by providing proper support as against watching and evaluating people as they grapple with organisational and personal issues.<BR>&nbsp; While the organisational culture does impact behaviour in other spheres, work is frequently required to be done on the domestic front as well. In a changing environment, adults as well as children need to perform under constant pressure. Is it possible for all of us to win? Managers spend time and take measures to understand and fulfill aspirations of their stakeholders. They stretch the limits to create a win-win situation for the organisation and its stakeholders. Can the learnings be applied to home life as well? Food for thought for managers and organisations!<BR>&nbsp; I feel that the speed of change is only going to increase and the pressure to perform will be relentless. Delivery of results will be exceedingly important. Hence, it will be useful if organisations were to focus the attention of employees on the importance of attaining success both at work and at home. This could be the starting point to help develop the completeness which is sometimes so elusive even in the high performers and in helping organisations to develop talent that can meet the challenges of the new millennium.</TD></TR>

He has an established psychiatric and psychotherapy practice at the Indraprastha Apollo Hospital in Delhi.<BR></I><BR>&nbsp; If you stop and ask anyone in the world what matters most to them, they would stop, reflect and then definitely say relationships. Most of us would, yet though we value relationships, do we spend time to understand them? How the manager relates to his or her team, how the customer relates to the products and services, how the vendors and distributors relate to the corporate and how the media and the government relate to the objectives that an organisation has. Most processes in a business are about how people relate to each other. Prateeks story is about how people relate to each other and how the organisations overlook this process while defining indicators of quality.&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; The relationships in an organisation are also determined by the relationships people have outside their sphere of work. There is constant interaction between the relationships of the players in the organisation and their relationships outside the organisation. Prateek, Ved, Kshitij, Nandini, Akshad, Priya, Vijit and Latika may think of themselves as islands entire in themselves like we all do but they are essentially players in a long chain of interactions. People around them influence them and what they hear and see influences them. They are influenced by their context. What happens in relationships is by definition not unidirectional. Just as Vijit does not lift a finger at home and impacts his family by this non-action his family too, somehow sustains the non-action.<BR>&nbsp; Similarly, Prateek is dismissive of Latikas needs perhaps as he feels that she is dismissive about his achievements at work. Ved understands his sons needs and prioritises them higher than his own. Perhaps, his son is able to give a positive feedback about such behaviour or because Ved has positive memories of a time when a mentor heard him out. </TD></TR>

<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; When people enter into a relationship they have certain needs. These needs have developed over a period of time. All of us have a need to be acknowledged in the relationship, all of us fear rejection and loss. We undertake certain need-fulfilling activities, there are patterns to these activities. When these needs are overlooked in a relationship we are either able to communicate and explain how we feel or we avoid the issue and become angry, hurt or rejected.<BR>&nbsp; When we communicate our needs we feel more acknowledged. Prateek, Latika,Vijit and his family do not communicate with each other what their needs are and hence, are more likely to be hurt. Prateek throws himself into work and survives, Latika walks out of the relationship and survives. Nandini conforms at home to survive but it impacts her work life and behaviour where she tries to be in control. Priya too probably reassures herself about the health of her relationship by analysing other peoples relationships.<BR>&nbsp; When we view the interaction of relationships we view it in a cross section of time, not over a period of time. We enter peoples lives over one day and see the interactions they have with each other and draw our conclusions regarding them and their personalities. We view people in a cross section even when we know them well. If this happens, our view of them overlooks the patterns that tell us about their needs, their motivations, what makes them do things the way they do. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="70%" colSpan=3>&nbsp;This cross-sectional view of people is what essentially leads to confrontation in relationships. When we overlook that they too have contexts where they come from we rely on our assumptions about them. These assumptions arise out of role stereotypes that are ingrained in our minds. A marketing person like Prateek is the brash, eloquent spindoctor and the man who listens to his son is a kind, balanced person.<BR>&nbsp; The kind, balanced person may only be spending time to solve the problems that his son is facing and overlooking what the son is going through because of those problems. In contrast, the marketing person may have been the most sensitive person on earth. </TD>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="30%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\154.GIF"> </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; The next logical question that arises is that if people have certain ways of being then why do they behave differently in different contexts? The probable reasons could be that the goals that give them a feeling of self-worth and competence might be able to drive them more efficiently. Some people, especially in India, have learnt through their growing-up years that they would be defined by the achievements at work.<BR>&nbsp; Organisations too, in their pursuit of excellence, reinforce this. The reason why Prateek is the way he is, is partly because his organisation gives him a feeling of self-worth and his relationship at home gives him a feeling of being totally incompetent. Prateek does then what is obviously more rewarding in the short term and does not focus on the long-term goals he has in his life.<BR>&nbsp; What would Prateek say if one were to ask him about long- term goal, this is perhaps what he would say, A good quality of life. What he has to learn like most of us is that a good game of golf at the Signature Golf Course is not quality of life, it is only a stereotype that the ads would have us buy. Quality of life lies perhaps in being able to relate to people you love and being able to communicate with them.<BR>&nbsp; Organisations and their business processes in general are no more than relationship chains. These relationship chains interact with each other and also interact with the relationship chains in the context of each of the players. These interactions then create a goal-oriented impact or a non-goal oriented impact. </TD></TR>

<TR>
<TD width="92%" colSpan=4>&nbsp; Shardul Tiwari watched with envy as his friend of many years, Parthiv Nair, walked into the restaurant with an almost springlike gait. Greeting him warmly, he said: I am glad you could make it. How could I not? asked Parthiv. You sounded anxious last night. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Shardul had a lot on his mind. And he knew talking to Parthiv would help. <BR>&nbsp; Shardul who had joined Glenn India as its human resources (HR) head early in the year, narrated the events of the previous two days. I have a manager, Kuldeep, whose performance this year has been abysmal, said Shardul. Hes a wonderful chap, and has an impeccable track record. This year has been really bad. I want to know what I should do now, for it appears this is the end of the road. Kuldeeps boss is clear he has to go, but I am not willing to let him go. I know, as HR head, there many solutions I can think of. But what Im looking for is an enduring, more sustainable and credible system that will look at a manager in a holistic way. I need to find that soon. <BR>&nbsp; Explaining Kuldeeps case, Shardul said: I had a long chat with Kuldeep and discovered he was facing serious problems in his personal life which was affecting his performance. His sister, Sheena, who had a troubled marriage, had come back home with her kids. There isnt any place for all of them, said Shardul. The noise level at home had gone beyond endurance with everyone at war over her marriage. As Kuldeep says: The logical outcome of thats clear to me, but in the interim, I am unable to go back to that environment or go to work with a clear head.  <BR>&nbsp; Have you mentioned this to Kuldeeps boss? asked Parthiv. Surely, he will understand what hes going through. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="75%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; Shardul looked at him hopelessly. Parthiv, dont forget that Glenn India is a multinational. You dont take your personal problems to work... Of course, I did speak to all of them. Shardul had met Kuldeeps boss and the country head of Glenn and tried to explain the need to adopt a more humane approach to Kuldeep. The boss had been quite clear on the issue. He said: Frankly, I dont see any merit in doing so. Everyone has his share of problems and the competence of a manager depends on his ability to handle different situations. However, you are free to speak to the CEO for another viewpoint. As for me, I wont have this man in my team. <BR>&nbsp; The chief executive had been gentler but equally emphatic. My sympathies are with Kuldeep, I do wish him well, but as an organisation how can we grow? You find me a foolproof solution and Im willing to look at it. Meanwhile, the decision on Kuldeep stands. </TD>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="25%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\157.GIF"></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; As it is, the pressure on performance is mounting every day, said Shardul to Parthiv. No one is going to discount performance just because you have a personal problem. You are expected to sort them out yourself or learn to cope. <BR>&nbsp; Performance pressures exist in every company, said Parthiv, but its the management of the performance that is the key. Shouldnt organisations extend help so that your performance is at the level that is expected of you? To enable that, HR has to work towards improving accessibility and send the message across that discussing problems outside the scope of work is not taboo. There must be a safety net in the organisation which you cant see but must be able to feel and that message has to flow from HR, said Parthiv who himself was the HR head of Peacock Industries, a large Indian business group.<BR>&nbsp; Parthiv felt it wasnt either about MNCs or Indian firms, but the kind of image that a company willingly and knowingly built for itself. Maybe, Indian firms feel less apologetic about extending a friendly hand, but other companies were under pressure to appear different, he said. Said Parthiv: As a company, you are trying to exact the best out of your people because you want to deliver the best every year. Thereafter, it is a chain of targets that are higher than the one before and with it comes the pressure to maintain that image. Then follows a regimen of cracking on the knuckles, and keeping a strict vigil. This usually results in a manager ignoring his own self, his life outside the workplace, leading to neglect, stress and a chain of ripple effects which impact his performance. <BR>&nbsp; Shardul could see some of that in Kuldeeps case. But ironically, none of his evaluators in the 360-degree chain had even pointed out work-related pressures as a possible cause of his not-so-good performance. If anything, his 360-degree appraisal had, at all levels, diagnosed him as lacking commitment, being inattentive and lacking team spirit. <BR>&nbsp; Shardul now said: Parthiv, whatever it is, how can you get your appraisal system to even recognise that work pressures can destabilise an individual?" </TD></TR>

<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Ill answer that, said Parthiv, but first, complete what you wanted to say. <BR>&nbsp; Said Shardul: As I see it, Kuldeeps declining performance is partly attributable to his personal life. But partly. Rather, Id say, he is so preoccupied about being able to deliver 100% at work that it has taken away his ability to respond to the demands of his home situation. In fact, I can see hes trying to escape from his home so that he can ensure that he performs well and earns rewards at work. Isnt that faulty? Its in the course of dodging his family life that he has depleted his energy to work. <BR>&nbsp; Parthiv smiled. Having said that, he said, you also have the answer to how your appraisal system can work better! </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;&nbsp; Shardul became alert. Before he could say anything, Parthiv said: Let me tell you how we do it at Peacock. We too use a 360-degree degree appraisal system, but there is a world of a difference between how it is used conventionally and how we use it. <BR>&nbsp; At Peacock, the appraisal system was the conventional 360-degree system until three years ago, when Parthiv took over the HR department. He found through intensive brainstorming sessions with his managers drawn from various MNCs and Indian firms, that an appraisal system had to have an objective that wasnt primarily professional excellence.&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; Our managers were emphatic that such a singular skew was not congenial for growing leadership in the organisation. We discovered that there were two givens around which we decided to build our management development initiatives: a) we must retain the existing humaneness and b) we must accept that a managers personal life is a germane part of his personality and total life. So, any appraisal of a manager must consider the wins and losses in his personal life too. Not with an intention to judge, but to push the drivers that lend impetus to his organisational performance. Thus, among the various parameters on which we assess our managers for leadership competency, a critical parameter is the ability to balance work and family life.&nbsp;&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="20%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\158.GIF"> </TD>
<TD width="74%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; Shardul grew keenly attentive. Parthiv continued: We found that there was the family on one side and the workplace on the other. You have problems on both fronts. You are delivering well, the results are there to see, but whats happening is that you arent building teams, you arent building work relationships, you arent mending relationships, you arent seen as a leader who would be able to help others to develop and grow. Yet, you are meeting your targets. There can be two attitudes here: one, he is delivering his targets and thats what I am hiring him for. Two, if you are building an organisation which is going to compete on a sustainable basis over a period of time, you know that this resource is not going to have unlimited organisational value even if he continues to work for you. Hence, it is important to grow people down the line who can bring that creativity and innovation to the table which will be required, because it is not just one man who is running the organisation. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; And that was where Peacock revamped its 360-degree appraisal system. Let me state it in brief for you, said Parthiv. The manager is evaluated by his subordinates, peers and his seniors just as your 360-degree system does. But where we differ is, one, the manager chooses his peers and subordinates who will evaluate him. Two, the evaluated questionnaire goes to a central agency we have appointed overseas, for evaluation, not to HR. Three, the final scores are sent directly by the agency to the evaluated manager, again, not to HR.&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; Thus, at Peacock, both copies of the report were sent to the manager evaluated, while the HR head received just an intimation that the copies had been sent to the manager. From the report you cant glean what the peers have said and what the subordinates have said, for it gives a total score on the parameters stipulated, explained Parthiv. Only the certified appointed facilitators or the agency itself could decode the data and interpret it.The process itself was very unthreatening, said Parthiv, because once the report comes to you you decide whether you want an interpretation or not. If not, you either file it or throw it away. The HR head doesnt need it either, since it is meant for the manager, for his own assimilation. As I said, the 360 system is for the manager. If he has built a wall around him, we would like to give him an opportunity to demolish that wall, rather than start demolishing it through our intervention.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Shardul was surprised. The typical 360-degree method left little to the imagination, was not democratic and was much feared at Glenn. But at Peacock, the system empowered a manager to seek help for his own sake. Typically, the manager would call Parthiv and say: Can you assign someone to be facilitator? Parthiv would then assign a person, who was a facilitator trained by the central agency, who was not working in that managers business, location, or department, someone who had not worked with the manager and also wasnt too junior in the organisation in relation to the manager. The moment a facilitator was assigned, the manager sent the second copy of his report or evaluation to the facilitator. <BR>&nbsp; What happens then? asked Shardul.<BR>&nbsp; Our facilitators are trained to get deep into the scores. When they see the three sets of scores and the final scores from the central agency, they see a picture evolving. That is also the stage when the manager divulges information and insights on his self. In 12 weeks, they prepare the development plan, which is then integrated with his work plan, said Parthiv, as Shardul listened keenly. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="75%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; Shardul who had a 360-degree system operating at Glenn had found that the managers evaluated usually felt threatened by its scope. Gosh! what does he know about me that I do not know myself or disagree with? was the common feeling. Parthiv agreed: Very often we are not good interpreters of who we are. But the way we use it, we are helping the individual as an individual for his own sake, and our facilitators are under oath to the central administrative agency which processes the feedback questionnaires. Balancing work and personal life is one of the top eight competencies on which a manager is assessed, and these are key to leadership building. If we find an issue here, an appropriate development plan is evolved and integrated with the managers work. </TD>
<TD width="25%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\159.GIF"> </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Parthiv cited the example of one manager who we shall call Badri. His facilitator Sugita came to me and said: Based on his score card, I am now finding that his work side is heavily skewed. We need to do something. Badri, I find, is working on most Saturdays and almost every evening. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Badri, she found both through observation and conversation, came to work every Saturday to think. He opened his cabin, put on the computer, sat around an empty table, and left after four hours. But what he did was drink tea and think. <BR>&nbsp; Its comfort, you know, Parthiv said. The room begins to epitomise something which he cant get elsewhere. She asked him what kind of work he did on Saturdays and there was little that appeared necessary. Said Sugita: I realised then that what he was doing was making the week linger on, feeling the safety of a structured environment: being with his things and hearing the same familiar buzz of the voltage stabiliser was like a pacifier.<BR>&nbsp; Sugita probed and Badri gradually revealed the problem that was on his mind - he had an autistic child. I am travelling 18-20 days a month and I dont get to spend enough time with him. As a result, when I meet him, I find I am completely out of touch with his development, the new initiatives made by his teachers, the new responses they got from him... and then I feel rushed, inadequate and totally incapable. Through the week I am mentally hastening to reach him, watch him. Travel interrupts all that. And when the weekend arrives, I almost dread being with him because he has covered so much ground while I was away. <BR>&nbsp; As you see, said Sugita, Badri needs Saturdays to escape encountering his perceived incapability. Badri had said: Saturdays give me time and space to feel about my son, away from him and coherently. When I am with him I see my incapability as a parent, my lack of being in touch, and I also see lot of work stockpiling at the workplace and then my system breaks down. Coming into office gives me clarity without the rush of daily routine. </TD></TR>

<TD width="100%" colSpan=5><A target="_parent" class=punch>People have aspirations and so does the organisation, and you have to match the two. HR must enable a culture that helps managers perform and be satisfied.'</A></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sugeeta heard him out patiently. I need to cut travel days to 14, but I cant tell my boss about this, what will he think? asked Badri. <BR>&nbsp; No problem, said Sugita. This development planning worksheet is going to be discussed. If the company has spent close to $500 on this process for you, it is only because it is willing to invest more on you. Otherwise, it wouldnt put you through it.&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;&nbsp; Shardul was moved. It is not Badris personal situation but the satisfying negotiation that such a system enables, he said to Parthiv. He now recalled what Kuldeep had said to him. His boss had told him: You do not communicate well, and we see that in your relations with your staff, you do not take customer calls, you do not... we think you should do the following... Judgements, not diagnosis. Shardul recalled the agony that Kuldeep went through, playing back his boss observations over and over again in his mind. He told Shardul: It was not the truth or falseness of what my boss said to me, but the sheer threat underlying the words that bothers me. The whole thing is like a verdict with no recourse. I feel very threatened and cornered. I actually felt assaulted. I did recognise that I had some corns and warts, but someone in a position of strength was sitting before me and saying, we have noticed these things about you... It was demeaning, I felt like a school boy.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Peacock process, felt Shardul, was empowering and democratic. A 360-degree appraisal was done, but no one would have access to it. The organisation did not want to look at it, it was being done to enable the manager to help himself. And even there it was left to the manager to decide if he wanted the report interpreted. Thereafter, there was complete secrecy and confidentiality. Even the god of all gods, the HR head, could not access it. Thats what Kuldeep needed, he thought.<BR>&nbsp; Of course, we have had managers who have declined an interpretation, said Parthiv. And what I tell them is: Thats really your score board, and it is up to you to use it or not. Both copies are with you, the agency will not send a third copy to anyone unless you authorise it.&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; So you can rest assured that it will not be known to anyone but you. Its yours, not ours.&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="29%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\160.GIF"> </TD>
<TD width="71%" colSpan=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;Parthiv cited the example of another top-level manager, a highly-rated performer, who contributed greatly on his job. But his balancing scores were very low, he said. Worse, in his own self-appraisal, he had rated himself very poorly, and that astonished us, for at that level, managers are known to sing their own praises. <BR>&nbsp; On being questioned, he revealed that he felt very distressed by the fact that his children hadnt got admissions to the best schools. That they were studying in an average school bothered him. The manager perceived that he was unable to balance work and home, said Parthiv. I am ignoring my family at the expense of my work. I am a senior manager here and I have not been able to get admissions for my children in the best school simply because there is a tremendous amount of networking and there is nobody to provide any support. How do you expect me to feel good about myself? he asked. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; At Peacock, they believe that if you want to hire top-notch professionals you must provide them with peripheral support. And that is what our administration department did, said Parthiv. They went to the school, got the information required, fixed the test dates and ensured the children were trained and taken for the test. The children performed exceedingly well, they have a good track record and were admitted in due course, said Parthiv. <BR>&nbsp; Performance is sacrosanct and that has to be delivered, said Parthiv, but you must also accept that the environment must help deliver that performance. The HR department must bring about a culture that, in turn, enables people and aids performance. After all, you are working on organisational growth and individual growth. How do you marry the two? People have aspirations and so does the organisation. And you have to match the two, and that can happen only through developing the right culture. <BR>&nbsp; The instances Parthiv had talked about at length were so small in nature, but for the organisation, felt Shardul, they were critical enough for them to create the time and space to handle them. Yet, he couldnt help wondering if Peacock Industries method was far too democratic. If HR had to stay at arms length, wouldnt organisational development be impaired, he wondered. </TD></TR>

<TD width="80%" colSpan=3><B>Atul Kumar</B> i<I>s a partner with Amrop International, a leading global executive search firm.</I><BR>&nbsp; The case presents an interesting situation and, in my opinion, requires discussion on two fronts, which are inherently intertwined but best treated separately for now. One, development or appraisal process thats either empowering or threatening. And second, the issue of balancing tensions. Balancing tensions on the job is one of the prime roles most senior managers perform today. Personal life just happens to be one of them.&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; To give you some more: cultural issues of a new country if you are posted abroad, language barriers etc, all impact the performance of an individual. I have known of managers receiving training on what to watch for and how to do business before being posted to another country as well as a course in a relevant language to help a person perform. Evidently, without much doubt, it may be said that the performance of a manager is dependent on the persons ability to manage the different pulls and pushes in ones life. What else is a burnout?<BR>&nbsp; Typically, it is a case of expending too much energy and time in managing these tensions.<BR>&nbsp; Balancing tensions is also an issue of having the freedom to communicate issues that build and have an impact on stress. The onus of providing a work environment that allows communication of all kinds lies on the firm and is a factor of policies and broader management and individual styles of bosses and subordinates. The specific issue of Kuldeeps non-performance seems to be a combination of company culture not assisting him in communicating personal problems and seeking help, also his boss preventing a relationship that is wholesome. In generic terms, several firms have policies that allow people to spend time on personal issues, that is, a leave policy and holidays (where taking leave is mandatory), flexi hours which are based on trust and individual freedom etc. In my experience, most positive employers, multinationals or non-MNCs, do work towards balancing these tensions at the workplace.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5><A target="_parent" class=punch>One has to understand the competencies needed for a specific role, for it will be a good platform to build performance management systems.</A></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; On a broader framework, it is also imperative to understand the competencies that are required for a specific role, for only that would be a good platform on which to build a performance management system. In our experience, managing stress is one of the fundamental competency that senior managers are required to possess.<BR>&nbsp; Business performance in todays complex organisation is not limited to hard numbers alone. It goes beyond this, into areas like business relationship quality and energy. Evaluation of performance should, therefore, also be by a diverse set of people. Usage of a formal 360-degree process, which seeks feedback from groups of people working under a manager, does seem to be holistic. But the basic process of a 360-degree technique itself doesnt make the tool effective. The winning lies in the manner in which the tool is used and perceived in the organisation by individual managers. A style, which is empowering rather than threatening, is more effective as it breaks down barriers to communication and simply helps rather than hammers. While I would support the involvement of a third party to manage the process of this holistic feedback, I would like to stress the criticality of human resources (HR) in ensuring the success of the process. While HR may not directly control such a process, it must work hard to ensure that the managers understand and utilise the benefits for themselves, their subordinates and peers. In other words, the environment of trust and belief in the process at all levels must be driven by HR and understood and managed by all employees.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="70%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; Another issue that needs to be considered is that a point-in-time process such as 360 degree and any other such tool cant be seen as a panacea to performance and development management. Performance management is an ongoing process and, therefore, communication around it must also be continuous. In Kuldeeps case, I am convinced there must have been enough warning signals for his boss to pick up and set up a process to communicate performance issues early in time and, in the process, understand personal problems. Where was the HR manager all this time and why didnt the firm set up processes, other than the 360-degree technique, to understand and manage these issues? Glenn Industries has larger issues to contend with than just these individual cases  the issue of building an environment of performance and communication. A whole culture that is enabling versus controlling; communicating versus threatening, and a performance environment that is challenging versus stressful.</TD>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="30%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\162.GIF"> </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now the most critical question. Who is responsible for a managers performance? While factors effecting performance may be internal or external to the organisation, the responsibility for performance is that of the managers. The organisation can at best provide the tools and the environment to enable the individual to help himself but it is the manager who needs to take ownership to effectively utilise these tools. Kuldeep needs to own up his performance issues and ensure enough communication takes place at sustained time-frames with his boss or any one else senior in the system to seek resolution and assistance and not let himself completely go down under.<BR>&nbsp; At the end, I would urge you to evaluate the costs of non-performance and replacing managers versus providing them with tools to improve performance and the resultant benefits in terms of money, time, organisational stress and energy. With stress becoming a part of our lives at both personal and professional levels, organisations and managers have to invest in processes and systems to balance life in general. Organisations need to feel equally responsible for an employees success in life and be an enabler to success against taking the narrow view of only the work environment.</TD></TR>

The case isnt also on the culture in multinationals versus other companies.

<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; HR professionals need to increasingly look at how they promote this organisational view, and how they facilitate the right balance for the individual and the organisation. They need to understand that the individual is the sum total of what he or she brings to the organisation and, at the end of the day, there must be give and take to ensure success.<BR>&nbsp; The 360-degree feedback tool is essentially used as a process for opening up the organisation. It is a way of encouraging managers and leaders to listen to other stakeholders in their organisational role: the boss or the peers or subordinates and customers. The real learning happens when they look at the degree of convergence or variance between self-perception and that of others, and the degree of convergence or variance with others in their peer group. The critical success factor lies in how it is implemented and what the results are used for.</TD></TR>

<TD width="100%" colSpan=5><A target="_parent" class=punch>HR needs to know that the individual is the sum total of what he or she brings to the firm, and there must be give and take to ensure success</A></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Organisations that have used the tool successfully began using it as a self-development tool. External agencies are used for design, implementation, assessment and subsequent support for counselling and action planning. This creates a safe environment for the individual and shows the firms commitment to helping individuals make significant behavioural changes to support effectiveness at work. This is what Peacock does.<BR>&nbsp; If the organisation uses it for an evaluation of the capabilities or effectiveness of a manager or leader without ensuring that the culture has the maturity to provide effective and real-time feedback, this is a recipe for disaster. If the results are turned in to HR, which then uses the information to make people decisions, many things happen:<BR>&nbsp;* The selection of raters is based on the old back-scratching principle. This vitiates the purpose of getting effective and meaningful feedback.<BR>&nbsp;* The depth and quality of feedback is limited, and most raters give a perfunctory score without investing time in qualitative feedback, which is critical.<BR>&nbsp;* Commitment to making real progress in terms of development and lasting improvements is relegated to the background and improving perceptions is what the individual works on.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; The most devastating effect is, of course, what happens to Kuldeep  his ratings are seen as the basis for condemning him without really providing a forum for discussion, counselling and helping the individual to address key issues and concerns.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="76%" colSpan=3>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thats about process. The other significant element in this tool is the dimensions on which feedback is sought. The 360-feedback process is designed to augment and reinforce the values and leadership behaviours organisations want to build in the culture. If work life balance is not something the organisational culture actively promotes, then the tool will not provide any way of surfacing this issue. What will, in fact, surface is dysfunctional team and peer relationships, inability to deliver on commitments etc  all attributed to slipping performance. This perhaps happened in the case of Glenn.<BR>&nbsp; The situation is exacerbated by the fact that the analysis and support is provided internally by the organisation  if the culture in the organisation is that personal problems are not to be taken to work and their impact not seen as significant, the individual will never have recourse or even the platform for real improvement and development.</TD>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="24%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\164.GIF"> </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; The real challenge for organisations is to spend time on the design of the process, the attributes they want to evaluate and how much they want to support the individuals to align with the organisation. I know of one organisation, which has developed a strong ethos around the 360-degree process despite an overarching focus on performance. In this organisation, with the help of practising organisational therapists, we designed workshops where managers understood the values of the organisation and how these translated into apparent behaviours. The workshops had structured exercises, which helped managers view their behaviours and how these impacted the work groups in a non-threatening environment.<BR>&nbsp; With this background, they were encouraged to do a detailed self-assessment. They selected their raters who sent feedback directly to the agency. Once the assessment was done, the reports were mailed to the people, and online assistance of counsellors was provided to them for six months. The individuals shared their feedback and action plan with their immediate boss and the consultants were available to facilitate the discussions. Some may say this is a long drawn-out process. Ultimately, it is the effective embedding of culture and behaviours that ensures a sustainable competitive edge.<BR>&nbsp; HR pros need to balance their roles effectively. While focusing on the business needs, they must ensure that theres clarity on the leadership behaviours. Theres sufficient scope for employee advocacy, and that the tools they use deliver value to both the individual and the organisation. Top leadership must understand that real organisational development occurs only when there is thoughtful implementation and a firm commitment to following through on the what the results tell them. Its easy to throw the baby out with the bath water, but the damage this does to individuals and the organisation is irreversible.</TD></TR>

<TD width="90%" colSpan=4><A target="_parent" class=punch>Theres a crisis at consultants bretto india - too many people have been leaving. has the firm been operating for too long in emergency mode, in the buffer zone? </A></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="90%" colSpan=4>&nbsp; Prashant Vira flipped the pages of the India Today, glancing at the bold blurbs that dotted the hijack story. Its the same old target practice, he mused.&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Time wasted, passing the buck, babudom strikes, confused signals, India had no clue, the US did not deliver, flawed perceptions, Vira lazily flipped more pages and finally read, Flaws in our national character make India an easy target.<BR>&nbsp; That was it! Pulling out a black marker, Vira circled the blurb below the article, which read, Before we decry the soft state, let us consider whether we have it in us to really join the battle. Sticking a post-it on the top, he wrote: VD, KS, RJ, GC - just the circled blurb is enough religion for us. <BR>&nbsp; Vira was returning after a six-hour emergency management committee meeting called by three of his senior directors at Bretto India, the firm of consultants where he was the president. He recalled the issues discussed and the agitation in every voice that spoke. The trigger had been the recent resignations of three managers of Bretto. But in those resignations, the directors saw the steady deterioration of the firm. <BR>&nbsp; Not that Vira was unaffected, he too had been anxious and unhappy over the loss. But in the last two years, despite all efforts, Bretto had not been able to achieve the much desired visibility. For one, it faced severe competition from older Indian firms and the newer multinationals. Two, although in its nine years of existence, Bretto had grown a clientele that was impressive and valuable, the spectacular growth of the first seven years had begun to plateau. The response: severe cost-cutting that took away perquisites and liberties, which in turn led to a team of disgruntled managers. <BR>&nbsp; Vira, who had started Bretto nine years ago, had behind him a 30-year career in consulting, both in India and abroad. So he had taken the plateauing growth in his stride, hopeful that revival measures would find support among his senior directors. But todays meeting showed that the unrest and anxiety had percolated up to afflict his most-trusted top management. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="75%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; Vira had heard the agitated ranting of his directors. Its not just the fact of their leaving, said Vipul Deo, one of the directors, referring to the three managers who had resigned, but the reasons they left. In those reasons and other situations facing us, we see the symptoms of a malady - Bretto is going downhill in an era where the only direction allowed is uphill. And, the sad part is, we are doing nothing about it. <BR>&nbsp; Vira heard patiently as Vipul went on, We decided to take a look at all the exit interviews in 1999 - mind you, 12 managers resigned in one year! They all said it is an excellent place to work in, they all liked the culture of openness, friendliness.&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; They enjoyed the variety of experience they got here. But, we dont see any commitment to grow, to excel, to be a winning team, that is their verdict!&nbsp; </TD>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="25%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\167.GIF"></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Everyone wanted to be part of a winning team, but they did not see Bretto as a winner anymore. I dont think we have done anything really spectacular, said Atul Dani. The leadership has not played the role of being an engine for growth, or developing people, or its image, said Vipul.<BR>&nbsp; Others joined in the dissection. Let me tell you what Regrow Pharma India told me last week, said Raghu Jairam. As it happened, Bretto had lost a major account in a competitive pitch. The presentation had been stunning, the opinion was that the account would go to Bretto. But in a personal interview, Regrows chairman Partho Vyas said, I really enjoyed the presentation, but my anxiety is fundamental. Do you have the people to handle this account which will run over two years? I have information that tells me seven people have left your firm in the last six months. I am afraid this will affect the consistency and continuity and even the quality of the assignment. So what kind of team are you promising me? What guarantee do I have that the top-profile team you are promising me will be there throughout? For instance, will you be there? <BR>&nbsp; Raghu looked at Vira and asked, Now, how are we going to grow with an image like this? Good managers leave after we put in years of investment in them. Its our promotion policy, our lack of drive! Others chipped in with their diagnoses - poor quality, complacency, absence of vision, short-term focus, too wide a product mix, not enough manpower... <BR>&nbsp; Vira heard the tirade patiently. Taking off his glasses, he said in his characteristic soft voice, Let me tell you guys a story. A beverage company I know, has a suit slapped against it for releasing date-expired stocks that allegedly caused food poisoning. The MD set in motion a strong damage-control exercise through his PR firms and he also deployed the finest brains in his organisation to get at the root of the episode. We went through the whole process and the first person who got the flak was the sales depot guy. He was amazed. He showed documentation that indicated rejection in October 1999 and despatch to the rejected goods area for onward despatch to R&amp;D for testing. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5><A target="_parent" class=punch>'It's not just the fact of their leaving, but the reasons they left. In these we see the symptoms of a malady -- bretto is going downhill in an era where the only direction allowed is uphill' </A></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; It transpired that the rejected goods were lying in the area for cleared goods. As it happened, when the stockists men came, a helper in the sales depot simply picked up stocks which included the rejected stocks and handed them over. But the supervisor in charge of rejections was emphatic that he had placed the goods in the bay marked for rejects. When they probed some more, the store helpers said that the reject bay had to be cleared to make place for some plant accessories which had arrived that morning, since the plant was being cleaned, and we had to receive it in the rejections bay. But we removed the rejects and placed them in this corner which is not being used anyway as there is some seepage in this part. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Now who is to be blamed? asked Vira. The plant guys for scheduling a cleaning activity on an unscheduled day? Or the rejections man for putting the goods in the cleared goods bay? Or the store keeper of the cleared goods section for not checking who was handing over goods or for not checking what was being despatched? Or the rejections guy for not putting the rejects back where they belonged? How did the system not pick it up when the report showed despatches of stocks that bore reject codes? Every man claims he did his bit - the firm is in trouble, nevertheless. <BR>&nbsp; The point is there will always be snafus and mishaps, changed schedules and unplanned movements. We will have lethargic workers, impatient transporters, lazy staffers, foot-draggers, silent risk-takers, power failures, unscheduled emergencies... Its very sad, they should not happen and we wish they will not happen. But are we going to sit back and finger point and feel sorry for ourselves? Can we move ahead if we all collectively decide to sit back and feel powerless? </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="20%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\168.GIF"> </TD>
<TD width="80%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; Today, you have enumerated 12 flaws. Did you discover all this last night, or have you lived with this feeling the last two years? If that is the case, then on a day-to-day basis what are we doing to gain control? <BR>&nbsp; Control what? asked Raghu. Today we have three resignations, over and above the 12 who left last year. Between those 12 and these three, did we do anything to control the attrition? Did we try and change anything at all here? Sarla Khanna said she was victimised for being a woman, because she took three extra months of maternity leave. But I feel there was more to her cumulative anger and disappointment. Or take Shantam Vij. A quiet, composed man, he never complained; we did not give him his grade last year thinking he will continue not to complain and no harm done if we deferred it by a year. Except, Shantam resigned. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Hey, one at a time, interrupted Ganesh Chitale. Let me tell you about Sarla Khanna. She need not have taken those extra 12 weeks, but she said to me, You have given other women six months, so why cant I? The difference is that when you are a senior manager, I expect you to manage your lives responsibly, commensurate with your seniority. And at the time she asked for an extension, we were bang in the middle of seven assignments and hard pressed for people. She probably thought she would manage, cope and survive and eventually the grade change would be hers anyway. But no, that couldnt happen. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; So, I did pull her off the fast track for that reason, said Ganesh. I dont think her resigning or feeling victimised is any reflection on the firm. In any case, we were not taking away her promotion for good. All I said was, prove yourself. But Shantams case is worth examining. Such a stellar chap! Who stymied his promotion? Our HR policies! Last year he was due to become assistant vice-president. Since the year had been bad, and the year ahead looked worse, the firm took a stance on costs and rewards, naturally. Promotions were granted to just three managers, and Shantam was not one of them! <BR>&nbsp; Karan Sobti now held up his hand to speak. You know there is something interesting here, he said. In every steady state system there is a buffer, a slack to provide for an emergency, but I find people usually end up operating only in that buffer zone. Like Sarla, she operated in the buffer zone of possible additional leave and in Shantams case, I think we as a firm operated in the buffer zone of his tolerance, and pushed him to the brink. We could have considered his promotion last year but for reasons we thought were more critical we deferred his promotion.<BR>&nbsp; Vira grew very interested. This is very intriguing, he said. Tell me more about this buffer-zone syndrome.&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp; Very simple, said Karan. Take our own local area network. When the memory was low, the free memory was 30 MB. But when the memory was increased 50 times or 100 times, within two months, I found the free memory was just 40 MB! Why? </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="75%" colSpan=3>&nbsp;&nbsp; Because our staff had unwittingly moved into the emergency or buffer zone. There is some sort of comfort there. Either you want to stay in limbo, that is, make no decisions, no housekeeping, it is a free zone with no rules.You keep stretching it, till it snaps. Here at Bretto, I think we are all operating in the buffer zone of every area - be it time, quality, people or profits, and in the process pushing the firm to the brink. Its like the railways, went on Karan. A train can arrive two hours late and yet reach on time. How? It requires 1,400 people all along the route to make tweaks to their system which means each one dips into his buffer zone so the train catches up. The flip side is, if a train reaches 10 minutes late, no one asks Could that have been avoided? Instead they feel good that the driver did not exceed his provided buffer time.<BR>&nbsp; How are you relating that to Shantams case? asked Vira. </TD>
<TD width="25%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\169.GIF"> </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; In Shantams case, said Karan, we thought we could delay his promotion by a year, he would still cope. After all Shantam is known for his tolerance. But we did not create a contingency plan to deal with a situation where our decision could cause unhappiness. Did we have a contingency plan that said, if this decision to defer his promotion results in unhappiness, then this is what we will do? But last year, we were at the tail tip of our cash flows, our morale, our profits. Our patience itself was stretched. And Shantam snapped. After all, Shantams promotion was held back not because he was incompetent, but because we took a policy decision to limit promotions. When I create these buffer zones, these slacks in the system, and they all come into play, then an alarm should go off if such a decision results in a crisis. How do we identify the beginnings of a crisis so that corrective action can be taken before we encounter the cumulative impact? That is what we need to identify. <BR>&nbsp; In the same way, said Raghu, if our HR polices are not giving comfort to our managers, where are the alarms in the system? If HR allows Sarla to take three more months of leave, but it created chaos in other sub-systems, why didnt the total system register it? Or if it did, why didnt someone talk about it then and not now? Unless you are now saying that our firm does not encourage communication - but that is not so! <BR>&nbsp; Likewise, said Karan to Raghu, last year when you decided to withhold Shantams promotion and he said he was disappointed, why did the feedback not percolate upwards? <BR>&nbsp; Raghu was annoyed, since Shantam worked under him. Okay, if I had brought it up to you, what would you have done? he asked angrily. Given him the promotion? Anticipate that he would leave? In hindsight everything seems possible. But at that time last year, we, the same people sitting here, had decided that the total promotions for the year would be just three! Out of a total strength of 125 people, we had decided on the three, how many could get 25% increments and how many normal and also how many had to be offloaded, remember?  </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5><A target="_parent" class=punch>'We have thrived on the edge of chaos. Any change we make requires a conscious decision on our part to be prepared to lose sometime in order that we come out better eventually' </A></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; When we took that decision, said Karan, we should have known there would be some unhappiness triggered in the organisation and therefore developed a fallback plan in the event of a crisis. After taking a sub-optimal decision to rein in promotions, we did not change the rest of the system to deal with it. We continued running the business on an as-is basis, after taking some critical non-optimal decision and expecting that everything will resolve itself - sab theek ho jayega! Whereas, if we had also assumed that it is a problem and that such a thing could happen, and gone on to create a mechanism to seek recourse to the president to at least mention the unhappiness... <BR>&nbsp; Suresh Samarth, who had been listening keenly, spoke up. All this points to the very arbitrary, knee-jerk reactions of the firm. And, that has to do with overall attitudes within the firm. Apart from what we saw in the exit interviews, there is this data which you will find valuable, he said pulling out a sheet of paper. I examined various jobs we did in 1999 and the time taken to deliver. Out of 46, only 19 were delivered on the due date. In all the rest, I noticed at the first review we sought an extension. Why? Essentially, it means that in nearly 50% of assignments we overshot the deadline! Is it that we did not enable the client to define the scope of his work, or we did not suggest to the client additional areas that he needs to look at to make his assignment comprehensive and efficient? asked Suresh. <BR>&nbsp; Let me answer that, said Brijesh Singh, another director. Even where we recognise that we need to suggest to the client that he needs to look at additional areas, the point is it has cost implications. That inhibits us! Why? Because, as someone said, we dont feel like winners. Consequently, we feel we cant command the price we want, we become defensive. Even where we realise that the scope of the work is more than what the client defines, we are wishy-washy - hedging, dodging, inhibited, apprehensive, apologetic - so that we at least bag the assignment. So, it is also linked to that interesting observation made by one of the exiting managers, that our image is very poor, so much so that it is percolating into individual perceptions! </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="20%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\170.GIF"></TD>
<TD width="80%" colSpan=3>Tarini Duggal decided to offer her viewpoint. The reality is, in many cases, not defining the scope of the work exhaustively works in our favor. We think we can manage it and we are able to manage it. So we are able to tell the client that he does not need that extended scope of work and he stays with the original brief. In 60% of cases, we havent been able to manage it, because the client has honed in on those areas which you decided not to suggest in the first place fearing a high fee, and consequent rejection. So, when he does push for those additional areas, you have no choice but to offer it to him and that results in a time overrun. In reality, in all our cases we are allowing for that ambiguity in order to cut down price, in the belief that once you have bagged the assignment, you can manage it later. Isnt that also a case of operating in the buffer zone?</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;&nbsp;It went on, each director narrating different episodes that pointed to lethargy, inefficiency, while Vira watched them all even as he heard their views keenly. Then he said, I am glad you called me into this meeting. As I see, yes, there is a lot of pulling up of socks that we need to do. But essentially, I can see in all the issues you brought up that we have thrived on living on the edge of chaos, in the buffer zone, as Raghu puts it. But we must remember, any change we bring about, any decision we take, requires a conscious decision on our part to be prepared to lose somewhere for sometime in order that we come out better eventually. And that requires each of us to become accountable, to be cognizant of losses, errors, slip-ups, sub-optimality... <BR>&nbsp; Thats what winners do. That requires an ability to recognise your mistakes as they happen, not try and cover your tail or feel sorry for your plight. But if you fear a finger will point at you, you could end up justifying your wrong actions. The more you wallow in feeling sorry, the more you will seek to save face rather than find solutions. It will also lead to short-term, patch-work repairs, not long-term sustenance. If you want long-term, enduring corporate success, then we must learn to own responsibility, become accountable. <BR>&nbsp; Yes, as you all say, it finally appears that the culprit is circumstance. Bad year, low profits, attrition, poor image, aggressive competition, deep foreign pockets, lack of people... Perhaps. But then what are we all here for, if not to predict change and manage it? Isnt that what our clients pay us for anyway? Then why arent we using those skills at home? Even the best system is periodically validated. Why? To review it against a changing environment - what you call circumstance. If you are happy to discover that the circumstances add up to predictable failure, then you have one more peg to hang failure on. Markets dont fail, governments dont fail, systems dont fail, people do. Because only people can engineer success. <BR>&nbsp; Before we depart, let me say this - if we focus on transactions, we will only find transactional solutions. Instead, let us focus on our attitudes. Let us encourage a culture that does not condemn mistakes but gives us the space to learn from them, deal with them and share the learning. That will promote what we need in healthy measures - accountability for results! <BR>&nbsp; As his car climbed the flyover, Vira said aloud, What we lack is an organisational character.</TD></TR>

<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;&nbsp;Viras sigh that the organisation lacks character clearly indicates that the finger-pointers have successfully initiated a new member into their midst.And in this case, this seems to be the most sinister issue for the organisation. A theory about character of an organisation or softness of a state make interesting reading but it is of little use to take corrective action. By succumbing to the demands of the hijackers, India has not become a soft state. Painting India as a soft state is aimed at covering up a series of administrative failures in a practically useless theory.<BR>&nbsp; Likewise, talking about the buffer-zone syndrome of individuals and organisations is perhaps an elegant and a very clever way to rationalise the failures of the past without accepting individual responsibility for them. Vira must first come out of this vicious circle of arguments and theories. The symptoms in the organisation are indeed clear and stark. Like a doctor, he has to handle both the symptoms as well as the disease and take decisive steps to bring the organisation out of its stupor. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5><A target="_parent" class=punch>&nbsp; Vira should send clear messages down the line about the accountability and responsibility of senior managers.</A> </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Three major symptoms seem to emerge from the text of the case. First in order of seriousness is that the unrest and anxiety had percolated upwards to afflict his trusted top management. The consulting industry has seen a sudden influx of several global majors in the past few years and the external environment has undoubtedly had an impact on the fortunes of Bretto. The initial growth of the company was demand-led, but competitive dimensions have since changed. For Bretto to consolidate its place in the new structure, it was required to do things differently  be innovative.&nbsp;&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="70%" colSpan=3>&nbsp;But innovations require resources and time to happen  both of which have to be planned for. The fact that resources were spread thin over a wide product range and manpower was inadequate is a clear pointer to the absence of a strategic response to the changed environment. One may venture to conjecture that their quest for getting business in all possible areas is also a clear symptom of insufficient specialisation which is increasingly is an important characteristic of successful consulting firms. While Vira has to bear the cross, the strategy of the company is not solely the responsibility of the CEO  his trusted lieutenants have probably not played their part. Vira will have to introspect and see why they did not play their roles as co-partners in the growth of the firm. Is he adequately delegating? Are the directors adequately empowered? Is the organisation too dependent on him for direction? Being a professional consultant, is he focusing more of his attention on tasks and projects and less on his role as CEO? </TD>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="30%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\172.GIF"> </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;&nbsp; The second symptom, inherently related to the first, is the failure of the organisation to respond to data. Exit interviews provide a mine of information about the organisation. If they have not been acted upon, the process is dysfunctional. Do manufacturing organisations that are cash-strapped avoid preventive maintenance of their machines? In a consulting firm, the assets are consultants. Should cash flow inhibit the payment of incentives to key consultants? If yes, was Shantam adequately compensated in other ways so that the organisation could buy time? More importantly, is the HR department sensitive to the needs of its people? If 50% of the projects had overshot, why was this information not acted upon earlier? The directors and the CEO are collectively responsible for the design and maintenance of these processes. Why did they abdicate this responsibility? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="30%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\173.GIF"><BR><B><FONT color=#800000>G. Balaji</FONT></B></TD>
<TD width="70%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; The third symptom, clearly arising out of Tarini Duggals viewpoint, is that most projects have inadequately-defined scope. In the early years of the organisation, business development processes focused on creating an impressive client list and paid less attention to costs. However, as the organisation grew, it was necessary to modify this practice and pay equal attention to costs. Todays clients are more discerning about the quantity and quality of work and have been successfully out-negotiating Bretto on 60% of the projects. Thus schedules are upset, work-plans of consultants are stretched, cash inflows delayed and probably depressed. &nbsp;&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; All this points to the inconsistency of processes with the emerging realities of the market. Also, process parameters are not consciously tracked, which is probably why this information does not cause top management to be sensitive to these issues. The emphasis is on projects and tasks in both the formal and informal MIS in the organisation  the developments of systems and processes have been neglected.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Collectively, these symptoms refer to a lack of strategic foresight, inadequate resources for innovation, non-adaptive processes, and poor MIS.

<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;The continued application of irrelevant or sub-optimal processes tends to reduce the credibility of the system, thus resulting in a lackadaisical approach to management and operating on each others buffer zone. Data, good or bad, then seems irrelevant to decision making. Organisational character, like individual character, is a function of the processes and programmes that run automatically upon the stimulus from external environment.<BR>&nbsp; To ensure the integrity of these processes, one has to continually reassess and revalidate ones responses. If ineffective management implies the lack of an organisational character then, yes, this organisation lacks character. Besides looking at his own portfolio of activities, Vira might try infusing some new blood into his top management team. Also, he should probably send clear messages down the line about accountability and responsibility of senior managers. Management consultants preach incessantly about the process view of management. It is time Bretto walks its talk. </TD></TR>

In todays era of cyber time, nine years is too long a time to exist without reinventing yourself. A key issue the case brings to the surface is the point of buffer zones. It is important to understand that there are no buffer zones at the top, in an organisation, or in the market place.<BR>&nbsp; Winners and leaders dont live off buffer zones. They focus on the zone of difference, between the leader and the rest of the pack. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Leaders try and increase it, followers try and narrow it down. This is the key dynamic factor that influences the behaviour and performance of companies. This is where the top team of Bretto and Vira are losing out. In knowledge-driven businesses such as consulting, this is even more prominent. If you look at what influences the zone of difference in these companies, it is people. If you dont manage your people well, you dont have a business.<BR>&nbsp; When things go wrong, it is only to be expected that the Im right, you are wrong syndrome takes over. This is when the leader and leadership becomes critical. It seems that the entire Bretto top management suffers from that. </TD></TR>

<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;The first thing they need to tackle and focus on is the question of accountability and then the method of solving problems, especially the people-related problems. Solving a problem entails accepting first that there is one, then identifying what kind of problem it is, the reasons for it cropping up, and then deploying the best resources to handle the problem. In doing so, it is important to understand the strengths and the limitations. In the case of Bretto, for example, there was an overdependence of belief that the strength of their culture would retain employees, even if they didnt get rewarded or if their particular personal problem wasnt dealt with, or they felt discriminated against. You cant do this with people anywhere, much less with knowledge workers. To believe that everyone will make a sacrifice all the time for the greater past glory of the company without much future is to be naive to say the very least. To put it down to lack of character is obfuscation. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="70%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; The chief executive should have taken the initiative to enter into a dialogue with a cross-section of people across the organisation, not just the top management. They should be given a vision of the future and their role in making it happen. It is important to recognise that the WIFM (whats in it for me) syndrome is getting stronger with each passing day. It is very essential for a leader to understand this. Today, people dont want to just follow. They want to lead. It is this quality that winning firms have harnessed effectively.<BR>&nbsp; You can no longer have a philosophy of just follow me, it will be okay, do as you are told and expect that to translate into a winning performance in the market place. Bretto and its leadership needed to involve the people a lot more in solving the problems plaguing the company. </TD>

<TD width="90%" colSpan=4><A target="_parent" class=punch>Patent needed a vendor who would respond faster to its needs, Its present vendor couldn't. should it outsource or revert to manufacture at its own plant? </A></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="90%" colSpan=4>&nbsp; Vaman Vittal cracked his knuckles impatiently. It was 3.30 p.m. and his next shift was about to commence. Work on 175 cars which were due for despatch was nearly over, and seven days before the due delivery, the seats hadn't still arrived from his supplier, Buckle Seats.&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>Vittal had been on the telephone with his operations manager who had promised to send them by noon that day.<BR>&nbsp; Vittal was the operations head of Patent Automobiles, who had engineered the creation of Buckle Seats in a joint venture with Patent nine years ago. According to the arrangement, Buckle would manufacture seats for Patent's cars in accordance with their design specifications. While Buckle could outsource some of its requirements within the cost framework agreed with Patent, it was not allowed to manufacture or sell to anybody else. <BR>&nbsp; Vittal was angry and also helpless. In the last two years, Buckle had let down Patent on a number of occasions. Until three years ago, such a crisis was unimaginable. But at that point in time, Patent produced just two car models. Managing the production and inventory control of two models appeared far easier in comparison to managing four models which were out on the road and a fifth in the design room. Worse, competition was so intense, he could ill-afford to have tardy suppliers. <BR>&nbsp; Buckle was born in an era where car manufacturers believed in in-house, vertically-integrated manufacture. Even so, Vittal had foreseen the future and convinced his management of the need to set up an independent seat manufacturing unit. But now he wasn't sure. The temptation to revert to in-house manufacturing was overwhelming. <BR>&nbsp; But the market was changing, and the changes in other industries were impacting the way the overall economy and manufacturing practices were evolving. Specifically, in the automobiles industry, consumer was demanding variety. Earlier, Patent could be satisfied with producing 100 units of one model, but today it had to manufacture 20 of five different models. If all that activity led to market place excitement, it also made Vittal's life a nightmare. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="75%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; Why Patent, even biggies like Telco which was originally only in the heavy commercial vehicles (HCVs) segment, had added light commercial vehicles to its stable as the HCV market had saturated. More importantly, it had become imperative since the total investment that went into components was enormous. Therefore, catering to one market was not enough. It was necessary to straddle two markets. "You can obtain economies of scale in components, only if you have economies of scope in the final market," said his technical head, Pradip Sinha. "You can make seats in small numbers but you can't manufacture gear boxes or radiators in small numbers. The investment required for research and development and setting up a unit is so large that you cannot be viable and competitive on price!"&nbsp; </TD>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="25%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\178.GIF"></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;Vehicle manufacturers did not look anything like the happy drivers in their advertisements. The dormant industry was suddenly faced with change and the only way they could deal with this change was by exploiting the economies of scope. <BR>&nbsp; For sometime, Vittal too had found his peace in mouthing this manufacturing mantra. Until, the same common sense triggered off a corollary, by challenging the make-or-buy intellectual debate and almost declaring outsourcing as a manufacturing truism, for survival in a fast changing market. Traditionally, most organisations manufactured the entire product -- including its components -- because that was how they sought to bar the entry of competition. However, a credible-on-quality components industry hadn't evolved. Today, that had changed. Manufacturers had become so tuned in to innovation that it made sense to outsource most components. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; But what made that possible was the recognition of a new variable called 'transaction costs' as against the 'traditional production cost', which tilted the balance in favour of domestic production in that era. In the absence of an evolved components industry, third-party manufacturing meant huge transaction costs of stock outs, which were so high that manufacturers preferred to manufacture in-house. But that constraint had disappeared with the emergence of quality component manufacturers and modular components. Consequently, and with the emergence of information technology, transaction costs had plummeted, so that in a make-or-buy decision, outsourcing became manufacturing common sense. While firms like Patent were still struggling with outsourcing seats, others had managed to make outsourcing a competitive advantage, reducing transaction costs significantly. <BR>&nbsp; Only last month, Vittal was speaking to a friend in Ralco Steels, which also supplied steel to Patent. He was unnerved to hear what ground the majors were covering.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Ralco was approached by a large foreign car manufacturer, Luxum, for supply of steel for its cars. Strangely enough, Luxum would not settle for a mere certification of how good the company's steel was. "We want to see what happens to the steel when it is being made, when it comes out from the blast furnace, its properties when it was heat-treated, annealed," said Luxum. "We want to know the entire story, so that we can modify the steel to suit our needs by performing other operations on it when we buy it. The quality of the paint finish is a critical parameter for us. The treatment to steel influences how well the paint responds to the surface." </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5><A target="_parent" class=punch>'With the emergence of information technology, transaction costs had fallen, so that in a make-or buy decision, outsourcing became manufacturing common sense' </A></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; &nbsp; However, Luxum wasn't willing to place one of its employees at Ralco as that would hike its transaction costs. Instead, Ralco could store the data on each process, which was being collected anyway, and offload it on its website from where Luxum would directly access it, thereby creating no storage crisis for Ralco. <BR>&nbsp; "That's how the majors are fine-tuning transaction costs," said Vittal's friend at Ralco. "Globally, the quality drive has become so specific and the demand for variety has gone up; therefore, managing the manufacturing environment and the related costs is what will ensure viability. With the ease of information technology, it is possible for Luxum to reduce its transaction costs and get exactly the kind of steel it wants." </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Plummeting transaction costs made it possible to outsource many things which would have otherwise been produced in-house. "This is one of the new common senses of manufacturing design," said his friend, "especially as far as automobiles is concerned. The attitude in manufacturing has undergone a change. Manufacturers are becoming more careful about the processes that goes into even bulk products. They recognise that different consumers can have different needs and variables in their products. Ergo, if you want to reap the economies of scope, since you now have a larger variety in your portfolio, then you must try and outsource nearly everything and focus on innovation. For that is the dimension of competition in automobiles!"<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Vittal knew that he must look at outsourcing manufacturing. But he shuddered at the very thought as the delays by Buckle surfaced, sending him through another bout of frantic phone calls. <BR>&nbsp; Yet, there was the Telco example. It was known as India's largest vertically-integrated manufacturer of vehicles. But, today, it had spun off component manufacturing to a sister company, Tata Autocomp, doing only the assembly itself. Said Vittal's Ralco friend: "It will amaze you that worldwide 70% of value addition comes from the purchase department. This is the trend we are going to see. Value addition comes only from bringing things together." If these were the emerging trends, he wondered, could Patent design manufacturing strategies in line with these changes? </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="20%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\179.GIF"> </TD>
<TD width="80%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; But that also required an agile and proactive component industry in India, he felt. Vittal knew Maruti had achieved some of that. But Patent? For the moment, he had to overcome his growing problem with Buckle, who he had at one stage hoped would become another Tata Autocomp. But the difference lay in the basic differences between the two companies, he mused. Tata Autocomp had the freedom to sell to other manufacturers. Whereas Buckle was set up by Patent to manufacture and sell only to Patent. At that time, it was a big move for Buckle because none of the other car manufacturers would have thought of outsourcing, for those were days of in-house vertically-integrated manufacture. Naturally, the question of allowing Buckle a free run did not arise.&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Despite all the managerial talent deployed by Patent, Buckle was weighed down by labour problems that created bottlenecks in the way of supply. When pressure was put on the company to speed up delivery, it led to fall in quality.<BR>&nbsp; Vittal now wondered if it was sensible to revert to manufacturing seats at Patent's plant or should he look for an alternative supplier and split the volumes. He was already averse to outsourcing from more than one vendor as in the seventies he had been plagued by variable quality across the five vendors who were supplying components to Patent. But the seventies were different and so were the eighties, and the nineties had let loose a very exacting consumer who now had a host of brands to choose from. <BR>&nbsp; There was the issue of displeasing Buckle, but that could be managed, since it had reached its manufacturing capacity and if fresh investments had to be made for increased capacity, why not look for a new manufacturer, wondered Vittal.<BR>&nbsp; Uniquely, the suggestion had come from someone in the trade. Vittal met Digvijay Dua, who was already running a seat manufacturing unit for another automobile manufacturer. He said: "What I would like to do is to import the raw material and manufacture the foam, but everything else I will outsource. Even the steel components that go into making the seats are available in modular form. Mine will be a pure assembly unit, just like the unit I have for Sensor Motors."<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Vittal now decided to involve his management consultant, Binny Walia, before entering into further discussions with Dua. Walia noted the many points he observed. One, Buckle bought fabric in bales and converted them into seat covers using tailors. Two, it was manufacturing the foam and certain components of the seat assembly at its plant. Buckle itself traded off when it was cheaper to procure a part. But where it had spare capacity, Buckle decided to produce it in-house. "One has to look at the make-or-buy decision, not just the cost angle but also the strategic angle," said Binny. At Buckle, since the initial capacity was built so high, it willy-nilly ended up making most parts itself. Of course, in many cases, there wasn't an external supplier, and it was working on a local cost benefit analysis than a global one.<BR>&nbsp; Thus, if it had 20% spare capacity on a machine, Buckle sought to consume it, but that also resulted in expending some costs of executive time on coordination. "Using spare capacity to spread costs creates clutter value," said Binny. "It takes away energy, focus and attention, design time, production time, and even leisure time." </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="75%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; Binny also noticed that Buckle had people with different skills at its plant. So, there were people working on fabric who were not as skilled as people working on a CNC machine. Or, there were the ITI-trained fitters who were more in demand because the labour market valued them highly. All of them made seats, but had different market values. They were being paid according to the going price for their skills which, in turn, created internal parity problems on wages. "I see a potential industrial relations problem at Buckle, waiting to blow in your face," said Binny. "Making seats is a mix of highly-skilled assembling and machining and also critical but unskilled labour. That's because you have different trades and differing skill levels operating together.&nbsp; </TD>
<TD width="25%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\180.GIF"> </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>And because there is a lot of in-house manufacture. What Buckle needs is a focus in manufacturing."&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp; Vittal processed Binny's observations in his mind. He could straightaway see that Dua's venture would eliminate the problem of multiple trades and skills. What he would have is pure assembly workers. But Dua was pitching for the entire business, not just a part of it. "I will float a separate company named DD Patent Auto Components, where Patent will have an equity stake. It will be a dedicated unit for Patent. You can rate my performance, and based on that, you must agree to raise my share of the business by 10% compounded annually, so that in five years, I have your entire business." <BR>&nbsp; "A vertically-integrated unit like Buckle has its own problems," said Binny. "If a design change is introduced, almost all design changes will have to be managed internally. And that is not simple. It will mean a change in the foam, the fabric design, the steel tubes, and even the button position. It was okay when you had just two models, but today when you have five models, Buckle does not possess the ability to manage variety." <BR>&nbsp; Vittal and Binny then met Sinha. Sinha was certain that the design change response time at Dua's proposed unit would be faster. "It's like this," said Sinha, "when we had just one or two models, Buckle suited our needs. But today with the increasing demand for more and more models, we must have a vendor who can respond faster to change. Managing varieties will be tough. We need vendors who can manage varieties in their supplies because now they will have to manage smaller batches across 10 models. They have to be swift enough to switch between models."&nbsp;&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5><A target="_parent" class=punch>'The whole ethos in manufacturing has undergone a change. Therefore, if you want to reap the economies of scope, you must try and outsource nearly everything and focus on innovation' </A></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Dua, in fact, had greater versatility, for he had three other collaborations with other car manufacturers for windscreens, light fittings and seats. That gave him the experience to straddle different parts, different buyers, multiple suppliers and naturally different models. Of course his asking price was higher, but what he offered in turn was excellence and promptness and a learning which Buckle did not have. <BR>&nbsp; One issue which caused Vittal anxiety, was Dua's desire to set up the foam manufacturing unit as a separate company, which would have the ability to supply to a wider market, not just Patent. And he wanted Patent to invest 20% in the foam company too, almost as a pre-condition. <BR>&nbsp; But Sinha didn't see that as an issue. "Just take that as an investment decision!" he urged. "Earlier, Telco was making radiators. Today, its sister concern Tata Autocomp is manufacturing radiators. If Telco makes radiators, it would add to its fixed costs and break even points would be higher. By outsourcing, Telco's break even point had come down. Second, Tata Autocomp is also a Tata venture. But its decision to remain in the radiator business is a business decision, not a manufacturing decision," pointed out Sinha. "If tomorrow Tata Autocomp, which is manufacturing various components, finds that the radiator manufacturing business is not earning as much as it expected, it can exit that business and outsource radiators for Telco. That will be a business decision." </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="20%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\181.GIF"> </TD>
<TD width="80%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; "Likewise, we can today give our corporate strategy flexibility by modularising the investment and the production strategy. Today, Buckle or even Dua's seat unit is a need, a manufacturing decision. If we agree to invest in his foam company, it will only reap for us economies of scale since he'll be using the foam from that company for our seats. But if tomorrow Dua's foam unit grows too wide, and we find that our 30% equity in the firm is not earning much money, we can pull out our investment and that decision will not change our relationship with Dua as far as manufacture of seats is concerned," added Sinha. <BR>&nbsp; Sinha was confident that an investment in Dua's venture was sound, but he would not recommend an investment in Buckle for the same purpose. "Buckle's major problem is the design of its manufacturing systems," he said. "Over the years, it has become set in its ways and I can't see any scope for change or improvement." </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; "When you look at manufacturing strategy, keep in mind the needs of the changed market," said Binny. "In the automobile business today, model dynamism is very high. In America, for instance, auto companies are talking of one model every six months. Earlier, the competitive edge in car manufacturing meant cost and quality of production. Today, people buy cars based on a segment where they see themselves in. Within that segment, they are indifferent to price. The manufacturer has to, therefore, focus on innovation, aesthetics. In each segment, there is a lot of model dynamism. In such a situation, imagine the impact on Patent, on Daewoo, on Maruti and on all the other component manufacturers down the line and on their production systems. The key parameter in manufacturing is production system agility. And the response time to change!" <BR>&nbsp; Sinha was clear that Patent needed to fine-tune its manufacturing strategy for the future. "It may be seats today, but we have to give it the same attention as we would say, radiators," he said. "We have to make our manufacturing agile and responsive to change. All five dimensions of a product: price, quality, service, flexibility and innovation, are prone to change. But, at any point in time, in any market, one of them becomes the competitive dimension. Today, in the American car market, quality is no more a dimension of competitive edge, because every player has reached that threshold level of quality. Today, it is a question of who can introduce models faster. We are already witnessing that in India. Suddenly, aesthetics, innovation and features have become the basis of competition. <BR>&nbsp; "So, when your competitive dimension keeps changing, is your manufacturing able to keep pace? For long, we have played on costs to remain competitive. But have we responded yet to Santro? Maruti has answered with the Wagon R, but Patent? A world-class manufacturer is one who has got a certain amount of threshold on each of these dimensions and is good at one of them. We need to create agility in manufacturing, and I can see Dua's unit being able to handle one part,'' said Sinha. </TD></TR>

<TD width="80%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; <B>V.S. Ram</B> <I>is the chief executive of Asian Paints.<BR></I><BR>&nbsp; Traditionally, a make-or-buy decision meant an economic choice between producing raw materials or components in-house and buying from an external source. It has now moved into the realm of senior management decisions, under the fancy label of strategic sourcing. Is this another case of wrapping in jargon what operating managers have always done without any fuss?<BR>&nbsp; Not really. To understand this, look at the changes taking place in the business environment. Customers of cars, as indeed of any other product or service, are relentlessly seeking greater value in this age of competition. Quality, service and quick delivery are now universally available and these attributes are no longer perceived as offering distinctive value.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; To retain customers and to protect market shares, car makers are looking for new ways to differentiate their products  by offering a wider choice of models, focusing on aesthetics, speeding up model introductions and adding new features. The sheer magnitude of these changes have resulted in new demands on manufacturing systems.<BR>&nbsp; Vertically-integrated firms (meaning those which made key components in-house), looked appropriate in a slow-paced era in which competence meant making rather than designing, selling or servicing a car. The absence of a dependable component industry imposed a potential vulnerability of market failure. Self-sufficiency was the answer, and it seemed logical for car makers to build elaborate plants with proprietary component-making facilities. While these features were universally true in the course of the evolution of the auto industry there were additional contextual factors that encouraged vertical integration in a range of industries in India. The restricted market size set limits on expansion and forced companies to seek value capture through vertical growth. High tax rates on profits coupled with generous allowances for fresh investments were a virtual invitation to backward integration. A cascading tax structure dictated the setting up of such facilities as divisions of the buyer but often the component unit was a tightly-controlled subsidiary or a joint venture as in the case of Buckle. The essential features of these forms of internal sourcing consisted of captive supply, low value-addition, and a high degree of control.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5><A target="_parent" class=punch>&nbsp;If buckle is unable to respond to change, it will be a pernnial drain on the resources of patent. The solution: transformation of buckle</A></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Today, with the evolution of the components industry, manufacturing components in-house would be justified only if it offered a sustainable competitive edge such as a lasting cost or quality advantage or a unique marketable feature. Honda, for example, restricts in-house production to only those parts which the customer sees, hears or feels, safety-related components and areas where the company has a long-term advantage. Such a clear policy restricting in-house production can help a company maximise returns on resources by applying them to what the enterprise does best.<BR>&nbsp; Outsourcing will free managements time, enabling it to pay more attention to the core of its business. Specialisation, up-to-date technological capabilities and sharper focus help outside suppliers make better quality consistently, and at a lower cost. In-house production entails continuing investments in R&amp;D, personnel and infrastructure. While these tend to be underestimated when firms do a cost comparison, the progressive cuts in transaction costs arent factored in. In a famous benchmarking study, Ford Motor discovered that many of its internal suppliers quality practices and costs were nowhere near those of external suppliers. No matter how competent a firm is, it can be good at performing only a limited set of tasks by itself. The key to market success lies in selecting such tasks carefully so that they yield the greatest contribution to a firms competitive standing.&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="71%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; In-house manufacture doesnt have the potential to confer a competitive edge on Patent. It has no exclusive knowledge in this area. Moreover, outsourcing seats doesnt appear to entail risks associated with an imperfect market. On the other hand, in-house manufacture will fritter away internal resources of Patent in an area outside its core competency with no unique benefit to its end customer. It would reduce flexibility, and delay design changes.<BR>&nbsp; Often, in-house manufacture may seem to be the only protection from unreliable vendors who violate delivery schedules, fail to meet specifications, or do not achieve cost-cutting targets. It is useful to ask if such vulnerability is the result of a market imperfection (too few vendors etc), or if it is merely in the perception of managers trying to cope with delivery deadlines. When there is depth in the market, a potential buyer is unlikely to be more efficient than the best supplier.</TD>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="29%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\183.GIF"> </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Mitigating a vulnerable position through in-house manufacture can render the buyer more vulnerable in a rapidly-changing market. Set in its ways and not desiring change or improvement, Buckle is the product of a captive market, inadequate commitment of resources, diffused management attention and lack of scale. Abandoning Buckle in favour of a new captive supplier without addressing these underlying causes would only create yet another Buckle over time.<BR>&nbsp; The case for outsourcing is thus strong. If Buckle is unable to respond to the changing demands, it will be a perennial drain on the resources of its parent. Over time, Patent runs the risk of getting dragged down with it. The solution: transformation of Buckle from an inefficient captive supplier to an independent market-centred manufacturer supplying to many customers. Such a transformation will call for a massive change agenda and will include Patent relinquishing direct control. The worlds successful car makers are among the most demanding customers. Ceding control over Buckle can, paradoxically, give Patent greater sourcing control by giving its managers the freedom to seek the best.&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD width="80%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; <B>Ravi Bhamidipati</B> i<I>s executive director at PricewaterhouseCoopers.<BR><BR>&nbsp;</I> This case is about two paradigms of manufacturing and the attendant supply chain configurations. We have a choice between Buckle, a fully-integrated seat manufacturer, and Dua, an assembler of seats. On our choice would rest Patents future manufacturing strategy.Some of the issues highlighted in the case are:</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;* Delivery reliability and quality consistency being viewed as success factors: These factors can reduce transaction costs. Vehicle manufacturers stock component inventory to protect themselves from erratic supplies and quality. A reliable supplier obviates the need for this inventory as well as monitoring costs (chasers and people in inward inspection, for example). Therefore, a reliable supplier gains a cost advantage.<BR>&nbsp;* Capabilities and competencies being built up by organisations: It is interesting at this stage to refer back to Taylors theories of management and his stripping down of activities into sub-activities and specialisation. What was true for individuals in Taylors analysis is true for businesses today. Businesses seek to achieve higher levels of efficiencies by stripping themselves of non-core elements and focusing on certain core activities. For instance, Telco becoming an assembler and Duas vision of a seat assembler. By focusing on a clear and well-defined related set of activities, the manufacturer or assembler is able to ride up on the learning curve faster and provide innovative solutions to his customer. He has less to learn and, therefore, learns better. Executive skills do not have to be spread over a larger spectrum.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5><A target="_parent" class=punch>The component manufacturer's climb upu the learning curve would create entry barriers for new entrants in terms of cost advantage</A></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>* Information technology and the Internet being used to build a robust manufacturing process: The example of Luxum is an important point on information sharing  a key attribute. It is leveraging the Internet to build reliability into its production processes. It is also interesting from another perspective. Luxum expects its supplier, Ralco Steels, to be transparent in its operations. For long, manufacturers have held details close to their heart and have been most reluctant to divulge cost and other process data. The break-up of the closely-integrated manufacturing set-up has necessitated the need for sharing of information between all parts of the supply chain. Changing customer preferences mean that the downstream customer interface has to communicate the changed circumstance to the most upstream of the suppliers. The Internet has emerged as the medium for this information transaction.<BR>&nbsp; Coming back to the case, Buckle was the creation of Vaman Vittals vision but the execution fell short. The decision to prevent Buckle from selling to other vehicle manufacturers insulated it from the market and impaired its capability to learn and innovate. Thus, Buckle was born emasculated. The mould into which Buckle was cast was also defective. Low-skilled and low-technology-oriented activities such as tailoring were situated in the same area as CNC machine operations. A process-oriented operation such as foam-making, which would benefit from a larger scale of operations, was built into the project. This outlines the fact that a tightly integrated framework of operations may subserve the objectives of the organisation. Make-or-buy decisions, in the past, had a tendency to be myopic. They have been typically led by rule of thumb, which stated:<BR>&nbsp;* Low value addition or non-critical  buy.<BR>&nbsp;* Cheaper outside  buy.&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; Manufacturing strategy played no part in ensuring that the vendor base capabilities were in sync with evolving customer expectations. The idea outlined by Dua sets out the broad framework of a supply chain web based on capabilities  the model for the future.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="71%" colSpan=3>&nbsp;&nbsp; Duas vision of a seat manufacturer builds on sets of competencies, seeks to marry the different skill sets required in machining, tailoring and foam-making at the final stage  assembly.<BR>&nbsp; Now, the different skill sets needed, suppliers would be free to develop at their own speed and cost, unhampered by the developments in other fields. This is the vision of a multi-tiered automotive industry and modular supplies.<BR>&nbsp; Suppliers would be encouraged to develop their faculties and become experts in their fields. And, like Dua, offer proactive suggestions to problems faced by their customers. In this evolved relationship, there would be service-level agreements between the vendor and the customer (as Dua suggests) and innovation would be the differentiator.</TD>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="29%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\185.GIF"></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; The supply chain web would delegate manufacturing downwards  the customer and the vehicle assembler at the apex of the pyramid, the module assemblers supplying to the car manufacturer, the component makers at the bottom of the supply pyramid supplying distinct components to the module assemblers. The vehicle assembler feeds information on demand through the module assembler to the component manufacturer. In turn, the component manufacturer keeps the vehicle manufacturer informed about production processes and parameters. Information flow would be quick and transparent.<BR>&nbsp; The component manufacturers climb up the learning curve would create the required entry barriers to new entrants in terms of cost advantage and innovation offered to the module assembler. In the next stage of evolution of the Supply Chain Web, component manufacturers would develop into pillars of expertise and would proactively manage innovations for the vehicle assembler addressing latent customer needs.<BR>&nbsp;Thus, the supply chain web becomes the source of competitive edge. Therefore, the choice before Vittal is to grasp at this new model of business and re-orient Patent. There is also another challenge before Vittal and Patent  how to recast Buckle in the image of this new model. Their success in this endeavor will determine Patents standing in the new order.</TD></TR>

<TD width="90%" colSpan=4>&nbsp;<I> This is the second part of the case study on hospital brand management and image-building. The first part dealt with brand positioning.</I> </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Dr Mahi Kunjamma Titus was startled.How long will you stare at that barium meal X-ray? asked her colleague, Dr Satish Pradhan, who had been standing there for the last six minutes. That stomach looks okay to me, so whats on your mind? <BR>&nbsp; Mahi turned around and looked at Pradhan, who was the nephrologist at Karuna Hospital &amp; Nursing Home, where she was a gastroenterologist. Satish, we need to do some serious talking, she said finally. Headhunters have been calling me for a new state-of-the-art hospital coming up in the city (read: Recovery Clinics &amp; Hospital). <BR>&nbsp; Send in your resume, said Satish, Recovery stands for all our dreams. I was expecting this to happen, after all, doctors like you arent easy to find... <BR>&nbsp; This isnt the time for humour, said Mahi. Remember, we joined Karuna to build such a dream. I think its time we did some talking. As Satish sat down, Mahi said: Recovery, I have heard, has hired a team of consultants to look into its marketing strategy. Remember, 10 years ago, this is exactly what we suggested for Karuna? But nothing happened. Now we have no choice, we must initiate some action. Karuna is a good hospital with good doctors, but poor management practices. Unfortunately, that has affected our image. Whats worse, no one even realises it. And when Recovery is up and running, Karuna will be forgotten. We must meet our chief executive, Tarun Arora, and insist on corrective measures to save Karuna. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="75%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; Over the next two days, they managed to get the support of six senior doctors and sought an appointment with Arora. <BR>&nbsp; You must have heard about the progress on Recovery Clinics... began Satish when they met the CEO. We need to work on Karunas image before Recovery goes on-stream.<BR>&nbsp; Arora was annoyed. This is great! he said angrily. A few disgruntled doctors find a rich boy to fund their adventure! How can a hospital be born on that kind of platform?<BR>&nbsp; The point is, said Satish, we must gear up to face competition. After all, they were a part of Karuna and a splinter group setting up competitive trade can be bad for us. </TD>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="25%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\188.GIF"></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Of course, everyone likes a new kid on the block, said Arora. But Recovery will not be able to hold out because a lot is involved in running a successful hospital. You can create capacity if you have money, but to get occupancy you need more. Because the health business is about resilience and quality. <BR>&nbsp; I think its time for us to stop denying the threat from Recovery and accept competition, said Dr Vilas Datar.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What competition? asked Arora angrily.Recovery? Healthcare is not a business where you come in the morning and expect to be cured by evening. It takes time, effort, diagnoses... We have been improvising for the last 10 years, look at our success rate, statistics. We have had important people visiting and staying here, foreigners and top-level corporate sorts. They have only had words of praise for us! <BR>&nbsp; True, said Satish, because there is no other place in this city which they can trust like Karuna. But when a new hospital with credentials and attributes like Recovery comes in... Interrupting him, Arora said: What is the Recovery team saying which we are not? Its not what they are saying, said Satish,<BR>&nbsp; its what they are doing and how they are going about it. Recovery is speaking the language of the times. They have recognised that health services will soon become a buyers market. For example, they have hired a consultant to run it like a business. They have studied the health market and targeted their consumers. Their marketing department is planning to position Recovery as a brand that offers quality service; they are not selling like we do, and they are confident that this is what they need to do. Recovery expects to convert corporate houses to its health system. They are talking of putting their corporate clients on a structured preventive healthcare and fitness plan...&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5><A target="_parent" class=punch>'Recovery is speaking the language of the times. They have recognised that health services will soon become a buyer's market. For example, they have hired a consultant to run it like a business' </A></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;&nbsp; It is working on image-building, positioning and marketing the brand - something we have never done. One year from now, if you ask an average consumer what health service brands he can recall, hes sure to say Recovery. Because there isnt a brand called Karuna.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mahi who had been silent until now, said: Mr Arora, our image is not very good today. We have neither tried to build our image in a structured manner nor are we attempting damage control when things go wrong. We believe we are the best. Truth is, we are not living up to that image. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; We need to look at the agents of our image and work on them, continued Mahi, while simultaneously presenting Karuna as the trusted name in health services. But to get there, we have to accept that we have problems, our staff members are dissatisfied, our doctors are overworked, our systems are sluggish, our customers think we charge more. Also, we have become complacent and our quality is deteriorating. <BR>&nbsp; Rubbish, said Arora. Its all got to do with the newspapers splashing the death of Ajay Sobti. Until then, there was not even a whimper about our image! Lets understand one thing. Sobti died because of an ordinary problem, not neglect, as the press made it out to be!&nbsp;&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; But why did it hit the headlines? asked Datar. Because our hospital is popular, the question asked was If such a hospital could not do anything to save him, what about the rest? It had all the amenities, but still the patient died due to neglect. Karuna is insensitive to patient care, only money matters. &nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp; These are common to all in healthcare, said Arora. Deaths will happen, patients may not get cured, this is a hospital, not heaven, so the success rate wont be 100%. So, to blame us for neglect if a patient dies under normal circumstances is too much!&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="25%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\189.GIF"> </TD>
<TD width="74%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; I agree, said Mahi. But unwittingly, that has tarnished our image. Deaths happen in Charubai Charitable Trust too, but they dont get talked about like Ajay Sobtis death did. And that is because we have a premium image, we charge high fees and we have this aura of exclusivity which naturally raises consumer expectation beyond limits.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Karuna was caught in a high-cost, high-expectation trap. Typically, patients said: We are paying you so much so you should be able to do anything. But what they forget is that this is a hospital and it can have deaths too and unsuccessful treatments, said Arora. The hospital cannot guarantee success, it can only assure good care. We are not Gods. A good hospital does not mean that we can save every patient. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; &nbsp; But then a good hospital does not have ordinary problems like nursing staff going on strike! said Mahi. &nbsp; That was not a strike, it was simply bad behaviour! said Arora. You must understand we also get difficult patients. More difficult than is warranted by their illness, mind you.<BR>&nbsp; As it happened, a patient got annoyed over the temperature of the water that was brought in for his sponging, which led to an argument when the nurse tried to reassure him. But when the doctor did not arrive, things got out of hand. In a fit of fury, he threw away his breakfast tray. Get him here or I will start breaking things, he yelled. The nurse got anxious and called in the security staff while she herself went to see the resident doctor about sedating the patient. The security had to hold the patient, for, by then, he had become unmanageable. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="98%" colSpan=5>Now, please understand that these things do happen, said Arora. So often have we faced difficult patients! <BR>&nbsp; If you believe the patient was being difficult, why was the nurse sacked? asked Mahi. <BR>&nbsp; You know she misbehaved with the doctor in the patients presence! said Arora. Worse, she should not have called in security! That was the worst thing to do. The patient was a senior bureaucrat, what happens to our image of customer care?<BR>&nbsp; The fact is, said Vilas, our nurses are not trained to handle crisis. When the patient starts throwing things around, it was only natural for the nurse to call in security.&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="98%" colSpan=5>She had the interest of the hospital in mind when she did it. She is not trained in human psychology to know what to do. Instead, we ended up having a strike, that was not good for our image either! &nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp; Now, read this instance along with Ajay Sobtis death-by-neglect story - and what we have is a poor image, said Satish. <BR>&nbsp; What does the press know about neglect? asked Arora angrily. What does it know about running a hospital? What do you know about the doctor who took the decision? It is easy to sit back and speculate, that is what media thrives on. Does anyone give credence to our side of the story? </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="73%" colSpan=4>&nbsp; Because we are a premium hospital, a private hospital willy-nilly, the expectations are obviously high, insisted Satish. So, the patients family expects you will heal, since they have paid high fees. <BR>&nbsp; How can you say that? asked Arora. Often, there are situations where we cant heal a person, but that does not mean our medical skills are questionable! The public is being unfair. But as a hospital, how do I do damage control? So, here is a situation where some doctors have left to start their own hospital. And we fear theyll use unfair means to garner sympathy and support and build an artificial saliency for their hospital.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; What frightens me, said Satish, is that in the process of thumping their chests and selling their wares, they will badly tarnish our image. </TD>
<TD width="25%"><IMG SRC="my project_images\190.GIF"> </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Then let us address the issues, said Mahi. We have similar problems that other hospitals have, nothing extraordinary. We have had our share of strikes, deaths, angry patients... Its an occupational hazard. But I also feel that we need to address the peripheral issues. Let us set Recovery aside for the moment. The fact is we have serious image issues and we need to address them. We have serious lapses in our human resource policies. We have serious issues in our marketing effort, rather we have no marketing effort. We need to address all these issues.At this stage, Mahi pulled out a sheet of paper and said: Before I came here, I met some senior doctors. Based on their observations, the issues are as follows: we are high on price and, consequently, seen as very commercial... <BR>&nbsp; Yes, we are high on price and there is a reason for that, said Arora. We are offering a premium quality of service which naturally means we are using sophisticated equipment which requires specialists to manage them. Our methods and processes are sophisticated... therefore, we are high-priced. <BR>&nbsp; Mahi continued: Unduly long hours of waiting and billing time, discharge very often not as planned, no patient management system... <BR>&nbsp; Let me add to that, said Satish. Unstructured delegation of critical tasks by senior doctors. Arora looked surprised. What exactly are you saying? he asked. <BR>&nbsp; I will explain, offered Satish. We have some specialist doctors and surgeons who are attached to us and also work outside. Consequently, their time is at a premium. These surgeons only perform the creative cut, and core surgery. Thereafter, they walk out of the operation theatre leaving the junior doctors to tidy up. We need to look at this again. An operation is not merely the surgical process. It is also about keeping blood pressure steady, monitoring patient trauma, pulse etc, in fact, upto six hours after the surgery. <BR>&nbsp; I feel the total delivery of the value is complete only when the patient has left the ICU. The fact is, that very practice has resulted in a quality problem. In Ajay Sobtis case, a post-operation fever and eventual death has raised a lot of questions. How the infection set in, at what stage it happened, that is debatable. One can go into all that and more, but the bottomline is there has been a perceived erosion of quality, said Satish. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5><A target="_parent" class=punch>'Yes, Karuna is high on price and there is a reason for that. we are offering a premium service which naturally means our methods and processes are sophisticated... therefore we are costly' </A></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Look, its not as if this has happened only to us, said Arora. Go to any hospital, they are facing it much more. It is because we are so quality-driven, we dont have many such instances. It is not because we had junior doctors attending to the case that this happened, although that is what the press reported. The infection could have been caused by anything... <BR>&nbsp; Mahi agreed. We work here, so we are aware how keenly the quality is being monitored. But unfortunately, in the medical profession, success hinges on the performing surgeon. And it is success that stands for quality. The flip side is, non-success is seen as poor quality and the flak for that is carried by the hospital. Since it is the image of our hospital that we are concerned with, you have to put down the questionable practices and quality issues so that it can be developed into key result areas.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Arora now took off his glasses and wiped them in slow deliberate movements while a silence hung over the group. We can go on like this, you will keep asking me questions and I will keep defending, there will be no end to this. But let us understand, no one has been dishonest. Things happened the way they did. It is one perception that we neglected, it is our perception that we have exercised extra caution always. In any going concern there will be a threshold-level of care and concern that is delivered. Occasionally, things may go wrong, but we need to manage such situations too, said Arora.<BR>&nbsp; If this new hospital is going to come in and say it is better and we are negligent, then we also need to show before they arrive that we have our team in place.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Isnt that what you are saying? asked Arora. We need to tell the world all over again what we are all about. How do we market an image in the service sector? We arent in the hotel business where having beautiful girls at the reception matters. We have terrific doctors and a great health delivery system. That is what we need to project. <BR>&nbsp; Then looking hard at the group before him, Arora said: I am not blind to what is going on here at Karuna. Our worst enemies are our own doctors who are saying to patients dont come to Karuna, it is expensive, get your tests done at other labs. That has to change. It is easy for doctors to say that because that does not cost them their revenue, but the hospital infrastructure not getting used means a loss for us! Then again, went on Arora, some of our doctors charge less in their private clinics. As a result, patients prefer to meet the doctors outside rather than here. This is a serious problem which impacts our perceived image, and our revenues... </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="20%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\191.GIF"> </TD>
<TD width="80%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; &nbsp; An embarrassed silence hung over the group, even as Arora said: So, I have seen some subtle competitive games at play. Maybe I am wrong, but there it is. For instance, if you put together the fact that our doctors charge less outside, that they run down other doctors within the system, that they ask patients to see them at their clinics, that they send them out to local labs for tests, what I hear is, We work at this hospital not because we are crazy about it, but because it is valuable to be attached to a big name and, however little, the money is good. But otherwise it is pretty crummy and we can get on with our business by seeing the more distant patients where they would like to see us. Now, what do you say to that? </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;&nbsp; That means four things, said Mahi. One, our doctors are unhappy. Two, they do not see themselves as custodians or stakeholders of the hospital image. Three, they are taking business away. Four, there is a significant segment of customers who are finding it difficult to access Karuna regularly, they would like Karuna to be near their residence. <BR>&nbsp; So, I see a need to examine the setting up of satellite centres and to build team spirit and a cohesive vision among our doctors #and# our support staff. A sense of belonging. Let me give you an example. Someone who was here recently to see me was waiting at reception to be escorted to my room. She asked the lady there - now dont use this against her - who the best dentist was? The receptionist said we have A and B and C, but if you are serious about getting better, I would recommend C. Do you see this? At the point of sale, there is a dichotomy. These are people who have to be ecstatic about every doctor, because they have to be ecstatic about the hospital and what it stands for. Instead, she sends out a message that says, look we are not consistently the best, we also dabble in the mediocre. <BR>&nbsp; The agents of our image are not merely our doctors. Take our security staff who have often been accused of high-handedness. At the end of the day, our customers are not in a celebratory mood. They are either ailing patients or an anxious family. You cant be tough with them. Yelling at them for not having a pass or frisking their bags, or instructing them to leave their bags in the portico... all rankles of autocracy. Hotels dont treat you like that, do they? </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Its all very well to say this, said Arora, but you have no idea how unmanageable the visitors and family are. They sneak in bhelpuri, and then they blame the hospital for neglect! Or they walk in when the visiting hours are over and use pressure tactics to meet the patient. This is not a hotel or a hostel. Patients have fixed hours for resting, examination, investigation, eating... we cant have visitors ambling in all the time. <BR>&nbsp; So, there are numerous issues to look into, said Mahi. If our security staff are also stakeholders of our image, no doubt we need to empower them. But such empowerment must be preceded by training and environmental systems. Therefore, training in customer needs, HR and customer management at the security staff level. Which again brings us back to what we were saying at the beginning: our HR and training must be structured and driven by customer care and service. <BR>&nbsp; Arora nodded. I agree, he said. Theres a lot we need to do on our internal management, but simultaneously we need to draw up an image management programme. How do we renovate our image? he asked.</TD></TR>

<TD width="80%" colSpan=3><B>Ramnik Parekh</B> <I>is director of occupational health practice at Sedgwick Parekh Health Management.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;</I> Karunas monopoly made its growth and survival effortless in the healthcare market. Despite being insensitive to consumer needs, it continued to hold high occupancy, till the news of Recovery shook its sense of false security. It now wants to review its image and relaunch itself. To rebuild its image, Karuna will have to analyse its present system of functioning for deficiencies and take corrective measures.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; The case reveals that not only is the organisational goal diffused but also the goals of departments and individuals working in Karuna. The CEOs vision is limited to high occupancy. Quality of service does not even feature as part of his objective.<BR>&nbsp; He assumes that high occupancy equals high customer satisfaction, not realising that this is only the result of Karunas monopoly. His defensive attitude indicates that he is hiding from reality. Rebuilding Karunas image will have to begin at this stage.<BR>&nbsp; Karuna needs to hire an HR consultant to redefine jobs and goals for every department and employee. It also needs a mission statement that is bought by all stakeholders. Low customer satisfaction reveals that people involved in delivering the service either do not know what service to deliver, nor their goals and roles in the organisation.<BR>&nbsp; Once goals and targets are established, patient service processes and protocols should be spelt out and communicated effectively to patient service staff. Training sessions on communication skills and customer satisfaction will facilitate smooth delivery of service.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5><A target="_parent" class=punch>&nbsp; The marketing cell should transform the 'Commercial' image that Karuna has acquired to that of a caring and quality providor.</A></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>A review of Karunas HR policies will be crucial at this level. It must ensure that it has a happy workforce. No hospital can expect to deliver quality service through striking employees! The management must redefine its policy so that it is mutually beneficial to the employee and the organisation. For instance, the staff should be given an incentive for good performance. Karunas employees will be its strongest marketing tool.<BR>&nbsp; Similarly, the doctors will play an important role in marketing Karuna and building its image. At present, even the doctors are working to serve their own interests. They only wish to be associated with a big name. Management practice has fallen short at this level too. The doctors are referring patients outside, and are not committed to comprehensive patient care, which is explained by the unstructured delegation of critical tasks by senior doctors.<BR>&nbsp; These problems are serious and responsible for hampering Karunas image to a great extent. The management must review its policy about consultants if it has one or form one if it does not. The policy must state that consulting doctors have a business relationship with the hospital. A periodic review by the management of doctor-patient flow would allow it to assess doctors contributions to growth and assist in better decision making.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="67%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; The CEOs diplomacy will help in maintaining a partnering relationship with doctors. He must realise that one of the core competencies of Karuna is its doctors and it would be best to maximise this strength to build a better image. If the doctors speak well about the hospital there is no way that the patient will not get influenced. He must, therefore, not only evaluate the doctors performances but also take their inputs on the functioning of out patient and in patient departments. An open forum should be held to have constructive meetings with doctors, which will allow them to voice their opinions and decide on a plan of action. The open forum should benefit both doctors and management. This will help doctors build trust in the hospital and feel a sense of loyalty resulting in reduced referrals outside.</TD>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="33%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\193.GIF"> </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;&nbsp; Protocol must be established by the director of medical services (DMS) for management of critical cases. Regular reports on recovered and expired cases must be generated to establish an indicator of a doctors success rate. Medical audits of expired cases must be done by a team comprising the DMS, medical superintendent, pathologist, head nurse, admitting consultant and specialists. An infection-control committee should be set up, headed by a microbiologist. A report specifying infection rates among ICU patients should be generated and monitored to control infections and guarantee quality.<BR>&nbsp; Finally, the marketing department should gear up to improve Karunas image. It should actively transform the commercial image that Karuna has acquired to that of a provider who is caring and offers quality. Marketing strategies will have to be designed keeping this objective in mind. It could hold free mobile health check-up camps in the neighbourhood or establish an evening OPD for few hours for poor patients under the CMO and the medical superintendent. The marketing department will have to focus on changing the consumers perception of Karuna.<BR>&nbsp; Additionally, since the media has influenced Karunas image, a public relations officer must be appointed to deal with the media for damage control and publish information that is conducive to Karunas image in a proactive manner.<BR>&nbsp; What will also help Karuna to revamp its image from being commercial to caring is a rationalisation of prices. It must be ensured that pricing is not arbitrary and justifies the quality of service. A utilisation review of expensive equipment may also help in this regard. For, even though equipment and infrastructure are expensive, high volumes would make it easy for Karuna to break even and make a profit. A brand is not built by just talking about how good it is, as rightly pointed out in the case. It is built by commitment to goals and actually delivering the expected service.</TD></TR>

<TD width="80%" colSpan=3><B>&nbsp; Sharanita Keswani</B> <I>is the chief operating officer of Quadra Advisory, a strategic marketing consultancy.<BR>&nbsp;</I> Karuna, first and foremost, needs to recognise that as a health service provider, it too is operating in a market environment. Just as for any other business, Karuna must understand that it has, most importantly, customers whose needs must be satisfied and competition that is emerging rapidly. This needs to be understood and internalised by the top management. Before addressing the issue of image-building, Karuna needs to first reassess its business strategy and open its mind to the fact that there is a world beyond just having good equipment and good doctors.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; It needs to develop a strong proposition and an action plan to deliver the value. It should try to pre-empt competition rather than be complacent and let the latter encroach on its territory.<BR>&nbsp; Karunas chief executive, Tarun Arora, appears to be defensive, even as he denies the threat of competition. He must first hear what his team has to say and then develop a methodology for repositioning his brand. He must realise that Karuna is a brand which has a value, attributes, image, and a position in the consumers mind. Karuna must first focus on building the brand and then communicate its position and build its image.<BR>&nbsp; I would like to suggest a methodology for addressing the problem. Arora should begin by having a brainstorming session with the top executives in the company, asking them to table their aspirations for Karuna. The objective: arrive at a common goal, develop a clear value proposition and then define a desired brand position for the Karuna brand. This means that the team should be able to articulate the value that they propose to deliver to their customers and hypothesise on the reasons why customers should go to Karuna.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5><A target="_parent" class=punch>&nbsp; Karuna's top management would need to modify its brand proposition to ensure that it is compelling and competetive.</A></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Once the team has established the desired aspiration for the business, Arora should appoint a professional to conduct a study among its stakeholders to determine their perception and image of Karuna. Stakeholders include various groups who have an interest in the brand and impact its performance or are important for its perception in the market. These include employees, customers, government and shareholders. A reality check on the stakeholders perceptions is what would be essential to convince Arora that there is a need to initiate action. Arora needs to develop out-of-the-box thinking. He is product-focused and not customer-focused, and hence, is continually talking about the quality of equipment and doctors.<BR>&nbsp; It would, thereafter, be useful for Karuna to have its proposed hypotheses on brand proposition and desired position tested among a sample of customers and employees. The perception of the key stakeholders regarding the credibility and relevance of Karunas proposition must be understood. Based on the differences that emerge between consumer perception and the desired brand position, Karuna will be able to identify the key perceptual shifts that should be focused on in communication.<BR>&nbsp; Karunas top management would need to modify its brand proposition to ensure that it is compelling and competitive. An example of a relevant core proposition for Karuna may be as follows: Karuna is the only hospital that offers total patient care  it promises to offer top-of-the-line patient care which is a combination of world-class treatment, diagnosis and sensitivity in a cheerful environment.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="71%" colSpan=4>&nbsp;&nbsp; Before freezing its proposition Karuna should answer the following questions: is the brand proposition unique and differentiated from competition? Is the brand proposition in line with the managements capabilities? Is the brand proposition relevant and desired by customers?&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; To achieve its desired position, Arora needs to exhibit strong leadership qualities and would need to develop an action plan. This would entail the following: (a) formation of a dedicated core team that is motivated, united and committed to a common goal  enlisting the support and motivating his team would probably be Aroras biggest challenge, (b) reassessing compensation, roles and responsibilities of its staff to ensure that they are motivated, and (c) developing a plan to ensure that the internal product is truly strengthened to deliver the selected brand proposition. </TD>
<TD width="29%"><IMG SRC="my project_images\195.GIF"> </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; This may entail focusing on obtaining specific international technology tie-ups, equipment, processes and training. This should go beyond the proposed offering of patient-teams planned by the key competitor Recovery, (d) redesigning the interiors of the hospital and perhaps providing enhanced recreational facilities to be in line with the core proposition of providing a cheerful and friendly environment, (e) organising training for all medical and non-medical staff to ensure that they are aligned towards delivering the chosen brand proposition, (f) establishing a feedback system to ensure that theres consistency in performance, and (g) planning a communication programme to deliver the desired brand position and focus on the perceptual shift required in the consumers mind.<BR>&nbsp; The communication plan should comprise a public relations programme which focuses on the specifics of Karunas strengths  its core proposition and how it is unique and different from others, specific facilities and equipment; training doctors and support staff; the new interiors and recreational facilities. This should be supported by a focused doctor-contact programme  doctors can be periodically met to update their knowledge on any innovations in the hospital. Karuna can also take the initiative of setting up a website that provides information on innovations in medicine. This would be in line with and support its desired image of technical superiority. Above all, for a service of this nature, word of mouth is the best form of communication. Hence, ensuring that the patients total experience is complete  from technical competency to comfort and total care  would be essential.&nbsp; </TD></TR>

<TD width="101%" colSpan=4><A target="_parent" class=punch>Should Chennur tea look at an entirely new business for growth and move away from its tea business? And if it does, should it set up a new company? </A></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="101%" colSpan=4>&nbsp; Prem Warrier sat up with a start. He was listening to his wife who had just returned from visiting their son in Chicago, even as he was preoccupied with a decision that faced him at work. She said: "The only thing I didn't like was his apartment; he calls it a studio. He cooks, sleeps, eats and even studies in that room.&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; How can you get focus? His books, clothes, soup packets and CDs all co-exist! I wonder if he will get his doctorate in the midst of a whirring washing machine, stale dishes...''&nbsp; Prem felt a familiar confusion return. Everything was somehow linked to his company's new business plans, even the apartment his son lived in. From Chicago to Chennai, it was a long chain of chaos, he rued. Chennur Tea, the Rs 300-crore Chennai-based tea company where he was the head of corporate strategy, was contemplating change. And after last week's meeting with his management consultant, Riaz Latif, the change seemed much bigger than he had anticipated. For not only was Riaz suggesting moving away from the tea business -- something Chennur was reluctant to do -- he was even redefining the business model, almost stating that it was critical to success in the new business. <BR>&nbsp; Chennur had been looking at growth avenues, but couldn't decide between improving its existing tea business with packaging innovations and convenience, and investing in ready-to-eat foods like a variety of microwaveable dals, curries, vegetables and rice. Growing the tea business found immediate favour with most, while managing director Deepak Rai was determined to enter new businesses. <BR>&nbsp; "The question is what kind of growth are we seeking?" asked Prem. "We can innovate forever since 'drinking tea' isn't likely to go out of fashion. But how much will we grow? And where will the growth come from? New users? New markets? Will that be enough?" "Let's understand one thing, we are in the beverages business," said Anup Tandon, the marketing head. "The entry of lifestyle brands has led to some loss of market share. Clearly, lifestyle aspirations are now more critical to the consumer and we need to address that. Growth will come from staying close to the consumer and engineering innovations that will improve the value delivery to the consumer. That's the only way we can align our investments with consumer needs." </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="80%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; As the debate warmed up, it became apparent that the argument was not in favour of entering the ready-to-eat foods segment. Anup suggested that they innovate on tea and take it beyond current blends -- iced tea, flavoured tea, and convenience packaging that would hone their skill sets. "What competencies do we have in foods anyway?'' he asked. ''Haven't we seen enough and more debris by the wayside, of companies that tried to enter foods and are languishing?" "Besides," said Sumeet Panday, the chief financial officer, "how are you going to justify investments in areas where consumer needs don't even exist? Enough and more's going into competitive warfare and fine-tuning the present blends." </TD>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="20%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\202.GIF"> </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; But Prem who had warmed up to the new idea said: "I feel we must leapfrog into areas that address next generation needs." "Tell me, how many people eat out of foil packets?" asked Anup. "Let's not forget Indian food habits. Which housewife would want to restrict cooking to a mere snip of the scissors and pressing a button?" <BR>&nbsp; "As long as you continue fulfilling the needs of your existing consumer set, you won't be able to pull Chennur out of the low performance trap that it is in," said Rai.<BR>&nbsp; It was at this stage that Riaz cast his ballot in favour of an innovative shift. "Attempts at packaging innovation etc will, at best, help you gain some market share and perhaps add to your sales," he said, "but not a quantum leap.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; If we want to take the company up many rungs, you must try and think of innovation in the broader area of foods. No doubt you will fine-tune your strategy in tea, innovate on packaging of and project a demand that will be up 15 times in five years. But what next? Yes, you can keep on nibbling at the competition, converting users -- which you have been doing anyway. And each time sales goes up by a few percentage points, it will give you an aura of long-term success. But you have to start looking at real growth, and that, I feel, lies in anticipating future trends and slotting yourself into the expected or anticipated future needs or lifestyle of your consumer set." <BR>&nbsp; Prem was willing to play along for the time being, but he said: "Whatever future trends you may talk of, it must have some bearing on what the market has revealed," he said. "Therefore, it may be okay to venture into areas like cereals and even pasta or soup, which have been fairly successful with consumers. These are days of intermediates, ready-to-cook or ready-to-use. But where is the market for ready-to-eat foods apart from potato chips and namkeen?"&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; "But where was the market for potato chips when Lehar launched its brand?" asked Riaz. "Even then, the market said why fear. I agree the concept will appeal to few initially and that sales will be limited. Was there a market for garlic paste when Dabur launched it? It is possible that the consumer even today does not rate its performance attributes highly, but we have seen in many cases that the product does improve at a rapid rate and even replaces existing habits or perceptions of a category."</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5><A target="_parent" class=punch>'You have to start looking at real growth, which in anticipating future trends and slotting yourself into the expected or anticipated future needs or lifestyle of your consumer set'</A></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Staying close to the consumer's current needs could blinker a marketer from innovating, felt Riaz. "But once a player decides to look at the future, he sets in motion change, by which time it is too late for existing players to retain their markets," he said. "Take the automobile industry. In an era of least competition, it stayed secure in the belief that it had created sufficient entry barriers and new players wouldn't come in. It didn't even believe that a change was worth the effort. But it paid the price by allowing Maruti to shape the emerging market. And Maruti was offering a better product at a lower price."<BR>&nbsp; Riaz felt there would always be scope for improving the current needs of consumers, but to see that as an investment for growth is where he disagreed. "The past is always a reassurance of what worked well then," he said. "So, you could continue tweaking your packaging, and offering multiple blends. But look at the bigger picture: there is a discernible shift in lifestyle and aspirations. Decode that correctly and anticipate the shape of things to come. So, why not ready-to-eat foods?" <BR>&nbsp; "But there has to be market, a felt demand, a need," said Anup. "After all we have to fit ourselves to consumer needs; that is the best way to have a winning product. The felt need and demand is for intermediates. Salt, atta, gravies, soups etc There is a market, albeit small, but it is possible to estimate a demand, target market potential and revenue streams. But something whose need has not been felt, doesn't even exist -- how do we justify an investment on that? How do we even know if these costs can be recovered?" <BR>&nbsp; "Of course," said Riaz, "a maverick new category which is futuristic will not proffer attractive financial yields. And yes, costs will be huge. But that is the price you have to commit to for real growth.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="13%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\203.GIF"></TD>
<TD width="81%" colSpan=3>"But tell me," continued Riaz, "what kind of information about the market was available to Reebok when it entered India? Was there a market for technically-engineered shoes, to begin with? Who knew? But there was aspiration, there was an interest in fitness. But was it enough to justify an investment of X million rupees which Reebok put in? What, if at all, was available was the size of the total footwear market, which included the market for Hawaii chappals! "And again, if Reebok had stayed close to the existing consumer need of functional shoes at a cheap price, there wouldn't have been a market for its technically-engineered shoes! "Conventional market research is of no use in such a situation, for no market existed for technically-engineered shoes.&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, Reebok had to 'develop' market information such as: 'Who could be the potential consumer? What did such a consumer look for in terms of value or performance delivery?<BR>&nbsp; What were his aspirations and where in that hierarchy could a need gap be identified to step in with a pair of Reebok? 'To my mind, Reebok developed the data by actually going ahead and putting its shoes on the shelves, believing in the compatibility of its value delivery with the aspirations and trends in consumer lifestyles and, importantly, whatever be the product, consumers were aspiring to improve the way they lived. <BR>&nbsp; "And that is how it sought to give shape and contours to a non-existing market and focused on the few variables that were available, albeit without any profile," said Riaz. "But it was one laborious move after another. But in that phase, Reebok learnt what consumers wanted. Uniquely, it was the consumer who came back and said that he did not want high price. But he said something finally: 'Give us good-looking shoes like these that are affordable.' A point of communication was reached. And when the consumer starts talking to you, you know you have a place in the market." <BR>&nbsp; "It was then the second phase began," continued Riaz, "when it redesigned its shoes, did some spectacular value engineering and adapted its product to the evolving mindset of consumers in India. That naturally brought down costs and, hence, the price. At that point, I think, Reebok started setting targets and calculating budgets. Not before it entered the market." "Kellogg's graph is almost identical," said Riaz, after a pause. "It went ahead in a market that gave no clues on its size. But Kellogg put the cereal on the shelves, threw in trial incentives, watched consumption and buying habits, improvised, watched, and created data, which it then set to improve. Now tell me, how could Kellogg or Reebok believe there would be no market simply because there was no market? If consumers were buying age-defiant creams, how was a packet of cereal any different? If you were eating parathas at breakfast, you were also using chandan to preserve your skin. The fundamental truth was that the consumer aspired for improvement."</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="73%" colSpan=4>&nbsp; The following two days, Prem and Atul were involved in intense debate. Yes, they felt, the market lay in anticipating future needs. The idea of entering ready-to-eat foods seemed less daunting now, although they felt the typical anxiety that preceded a vital move. Many new entrants had blazed the trail of new categories, but as Prem said: "I wouldn't go by their examples alone. After all, some were seeking new markets. But yes, we can find encouragement in what Dabur, Lehar and RCI did. These are firms like ours which sought to grow beyond their existing businesses. And, if both Reebok and Kellogg succeeded in breaking the myths behind their expected failure, I'd think it was also because they were multinationals with deep pockets." </TD>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="25%"><IMG SRC="my project_images\204.GIF"> </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; "Wrong," said Riaz, when Atul repeated that argument. "Because they were both start-ups and not divisions of an existing company." Atul was surprised, even as Riaz said: "And that is the other aspect of a new business. If you have decided to enter the ready-to-eat foods segment, understand that its success will depend on the business model too. Because a new product category, one that is pathbreaking or even different from the mainstream product category of an existing company, needs an environment where there are no benchmarks, no history, no common ledgers, where small wins create energy and not invite ridicule, and provide focus and drive." <BR>&nbsp; "That might explain why Cadbury failed in ice-creams, why Marico's fabric care business may be slow. So the point I am leading to is: if you decide to enter the ready-to-eat foods business set up let it be a separate firm and not run it through a division of Chennur,'' said Riaz. And that led to a fresh round of agitation and anxiety in Prem's mind. "Where is the need for that?" he asked. "As it is entering a new category, it's going to strain our bottomline; we hardly need additional costs to render the idea unviable. I am not sure I agree with you," he said. <BR>&nbsp; "Let me explain,'' said Riaz. "It is difficult for established firms to undertake new ventures and sit patiently through the start-up stages. Mind you, the new business is not going to reap revenues in year one or two or three. It is going to be a slow, tedious process of trial, error and repairs. The tea division will not sit back and watch quietly. There will be the tug and pull of resource allocation and you will unwittingly expect the same financial performance standards from your new business which apply to the more successful tea business. What will happen in the process is that you will set tough targets for the new business, harass its every move and curb its independence.<BR>&nbsp; "Maybe," said Prem. "But pre-warned is forearmed. We can bear this in mind and ensure complete independence for the new business. But setting up a separate company doesn't make sense. Firstly, we do not even know if the new business is going to pay for its upkeep. If it is a division, it can readily use our existing market research, and financial services facilities, the administration and even the sales team. Those are huge costs: it does not make sense to duplicate these services and costs. Once the new business starts to reap revenues, it can decide..." </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5><A target="_parent" class=punch>'A division divides vision, and splintered divisions do not sanction success. A new business requires a distinctive vision. Also, it will have lower profit margins than a mainstream business' </A></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; "I agree," said Anup. "After all isn't Hindustan Lever Ltd (HLL) running five distinctive businesses as divisions? It's a question of good company practices and ensuring focus. In fact, that's the reason Walls ice-cream is able to hold out. If it had been a separate company, it would have folded up by now. As a division, the support costs are borne by a common pool."<BR>&nbsp; But Riaz wouldn't agree. "It is risky, let me warn you," he said. "Besides you are not HLL. That company has evolved and grown so many businesses that it has covered a better part of the learning curve. But it has had its share of stumbling too. For example, consider why Lipton did not succeed in its various forays into foods like pasta and fruit-based beverages. <BR>&nbsp; So, it is not just start-ups -- even existing companies planning a different business need the environ of a separate organisation. An established business thinks and behaves differently from a new business. Thus, when it entered ice-creams, Cadbury may have believed it was dealing with an established market.&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; There may have been a market for ice-creams, but to go out there and create a fever for your specific brand, even create a parlour habit, was something new. That attitude of the mainstream business has a rub-off effect on the new division and I suspect that the Dollops team too thought it was there to enhance corporate growth when, in fact, it was there to explore a new product category. Besides when you are on support, you can't feel only for your division, you harbour feelings of anxiety for the support the mainstream business is giving you.'' <BR>&nbsp; The advantage of starting alone, felt Riaz, was the ability to develop a distinctive vision for the new business without the tedium of constant referrals to the mainstream business' success. "A division 'divides vision' and splintered visions don't guarantee success," he said. "Your new business will have lower profit margins than your mainstream business, a different consumer set to cater to, maybe a different distribution strategy. Left alone, it will develop the initiative to look at the market from a zero-base. Combined with the tea business and an access to a common resource pool, it will willy-nilly focus on cost-benefits, resource optimisation and the path of least resistance." </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="13%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\205.GIF"> </TD>
<TD width="87%" colSpan=3>&nbsp;&nbsp; Ready-to-eat foods was an entirely different business with different consumer needs, felt Riaz, which necessarily demanded a separate organisation."Examples abound, but it is for you to learn from their experiences," said Riaz. "Even when there is a market for the new category, you still need to set up a separate organisation. Why did Glaxo eventually exit its foods business? Foods was a division of this large pharmaceuticals company, which was geared for ethical selling and not consumer selling. Reckitt, on the other hand, has set up its pharmaceuticals business as a separate firm -- Reckitt Piramal. It knows there is a market for over-the-counter products, yet it has chosen to set up a separate company. It will work since the visions are independent," said Riaz.&nbsp;&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Does that mean that each time we want to enter a new business we have to float separate companies?" asked Prem. "Well, I suppose as long as they are strategically different from the mainstream business," suggested Anup. "But I also think that once they have grown they should be merged with the mother firm. Because by then, their independent costs will get to be economically unviable and, in fact, an advantage is to be had in the economies of scale the merger will proffer." <BR>&nbsp; Riaz grew thoughtful. "That I am not sure of," he said. "It will depend on the nature of the business. But essentially, the same reasons for their separation will also operate in their merger. Those reasons don't disappear. If sharing resources is the theme, you will be back in the argument room over budgets, share of resources and rationalisation of product lists."&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;&nbsp; Prem disagreed. "HLL has merged its foods and skin care firms into its mainstream soaps and detergents firm. Surely, you aren't suggesting that will be sub-optimal?" he asked. <BR>&nbsp; Riaz dodged that one. It was difficult to answer that, even as he knew that for a multi-product multi-business firm with such a fine-tuned business model, this was unlikely. Instead, he said: "Every business has its own vision and lifespan, its own strengths and weaknesses. Within that, there will always be a re-arrangement of business focus. What is mainstream today may become secondary tomorrow. What if your ready-to-eat foods business outgrows your tea business?" he asked. <BR>&nbsp; This was one big move; the choice of business was no more an issue with Atul; what worried him was Riaz's suggestion that if it was a business clearly distinctive from the core business, it should be handled out of a separate organisation. </TD></TR>

<TD width="87%" colSpan=3><B>Utpal Sengupta</B> <I>is president of ITC AgroTech.<BR></I><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The debate among Prem, Riyaz, Anup and others at Chennur Tea throws up several interesting issues. Before dealing with whether Chennur's new venture should be a division or a separate company, let us look at some other issues: Sticking to the knitting: It is not clear what skill-set Chennur expects to bring to the ready-to-eat foods category. Growth aspirations need to be based on reality. There is no evidence of a SWOT analysis having been done by Chennur, and if at all it was conducted, whether it would support the bold new initiative the company is contemplating. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Arguments that move back and forth are personal viewpoints or prejudices rather than objective facts. A new venture needs to be based on market analysis, consumer research and hard-headed evaluation of competencies. As a matter of fact, when Anup asks for evidence to justify the new venture, his is a voice in the wilderness. By then, the others in the group are 'warming up to the new business idea'. <BR>&nbsp; Staircase vs leap-frog: Dramatic shifts in business strategy may sound exciting but in today's competitive market place, may not make prudent business sense. Deepak and Prem, spurred on by Riyaz, are getting ready to bet on the company based on the unsubstantiated hope that the ready-to-eat food category will change the company's fortunes. Research shows that such dramatic shifts in business strategy are fraught with risk and seldom succeed. Successful growth companies engineer changes in strategy one step at a time. They take the 'staircase' approach to growth rather than hope to seize it in one leap. With each small step, they add to their learning and competencies. Such steps, taken frequently, add up to a giant leap in a reasonably short time. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5><A target="_parent" class=punch>A new business venture needs to be&nbsp; based on market analysis, consumer research and hard-headed evaluation of companies</A></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Riyaz's examples in this context of the new ventures attempted by Kellogg and Reebok are misleading. These are Indian entities of large multinationals that have intimate understanding of their respective businesses and product categories. They have a great staying power and are in the process of creating market positions for themselves in India for the future. The strategy adopted by these companies can't serve as a beacon for Chennur. <BR>&nbsp; There are, however, several Indian companies that have come up with innovative new products and succeeded beyond their wildest dreams. Nirma, Dabur, Ranbaxy are such examples. In today's IT-dominated world, the examples of Wipro, Infosys and Satyam are rapidly becoming legendary. However, it should be remembered that these are examples of companies that succeeded. Several companies with innovative new products sank without a trace even though they may have shown great promise at the beginning. <BR>&nbsp; Does this mean Chennur should not attempt any innovations? Certainly not, but it needs to do its homework first. It should look for ways to reduce the risks of entering a new business by following a more thorough process to understand the new category. This is not the time or place to make a case on the basis of consumer research. However, it needs to be said that it is wrong to suggest that 'conventional market research is of no use in such situations'. </TD></TR>

<TD width="71%" colSpan=4>&nbsp; Division vs independent company: The question of how to structure the new business, as a division or an independent company, puts form before substance. Given the nature of the new venture and its 'fit' with Chennur's existing business, success or failure is likely to be determined by the intrinsic soundness of the business plan rather than anything else. Having said that, it is worthwhile examining the issues raised by Riyaz in support of a separate company. <BR>&nbsp; 'Mindset' is certainly a key factor that determines success. However, to say that the right mindset cannot be created within a divisional set-up flies in the face of accumulated experience. The case itself cites several examples of disparate businesses successfully co-existing as divisions within a single company. </TD>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="29%"><IMG SRC="my project_images\207.GIF"> </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Another celebrated case is that of General Motors' Saturn division. When the automobile company wanted to do something truly radical in what was otherwise seen as a bureaucratic organisation, it created Saturn. Other organisations habitually spin off 'skunk works'. These consist of small, highly creative and motivated groups of people working towards focused objectives, while remaining within the organisational umbrella. They create a separate identity for themselves, distinct from the main organisation. Intrapreneurship is the name of the game. <BR>&nbsp; In this age of mergers and acquisitions, evidence suggests that there are several fiscal and operational advantages of operating within one organisation with a divisional set-up. It has also been seen that it is possible in such a set-up to provide autonomy for each business so as not to adversely impinge on the achievement of its objectives. <BR>&nbsp; As a matter of fact, it can be argued that shorn of administrative responsibilities (which would be inescapable in a separate company), a divisional structure helps in realising goals because it leaves people to focus solely on the main task at hand. Besides, a division of a large company is more likely to attract high quality talent, critical to a new venture, as compared to a struggling start-up. <BR>&nbsp; It has to be recognised. However, the same solution may not fit all. The answer to the question faced by Prem and his colleagues can only emerge from a dispassionate evaluation of the benefits and risks of a truly liberated mindset in a separate company. This will need to be weighed against the synergy benefits that can be achieved in a divisionalised structure in their specific case. </TD></TR>

<TD width="87%" colSpan=3><B>SANJAY SEHGAL</B> <I>is vice-president (marketing), Nestle<BR></I><BR>&nbsp; The Chennur Tea case throws up issues pertaining to how an organisation should plan and engineer long-term growth. As the saying goes: "The art of progress is to preserve order amid change and to preserve change amid order." This is, essentially, the dilemma that Chennur faces. <BR>&nbsp; Two fundamental decision points emerge in the case of Chennur: </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; How should the organisation ensure growth? Should it focus on its current operations and competencies or does it need to enter new categories to ensure long-term relevance? <BR>&nbsp; What business model should it follow? Should it operate in the current set-up or should Chennur be split into two distinct companies? <BR>&nbsp; Has the current business reached saturation levels, offering no opportunities for growth? This is unlikely. The product category may be mature but Chennur has to examine its operations in the light of its competitive position. It seems to be a small or medium-sized operation in a huge category. While rapid growth is unlikely for Chennur, it must retain its interest in tea or face loss of consumer franchise and share erosion. Innovation and renovation can help Chennur freshen up its product offering(s) within the tea category and drive growth through share gains and expansion into new locations or segments. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5><A target="_parent" class=punch>It is important for chennur to create an environment and a mindset that encourages growth within the organisation.</A>&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;Remember: "There are no mature brands or products. Only mature managers." What should be the basis for determining new opportunities? Business opportunities can't be determined in isolation of the organisation's ability to tap them. An in-depth understanding of the organisation's strengths or weaknesses and core competencies must be carried out before entering new categories. The consultant forgets that before diversifying into new business, Chennur has to go through mild introspection. <BR>&nbsp; The management needs to consider what Chennur's current competencies are. For instance, does it have brands that can be extended naturally into other segments? What kind of distribution muscle does it have? Does it have an edge in understanding consumer needs in certain business categories? Does it have technical expertise or buying muscle in handling certain raw materials or commodities? <BR>&nbsp; It needs to identify which "high potential" categories it is best equipped to enter. Next, it needs to look at the current players operating in that segment and whether Chennur will have the financial strength to grab or develop business. Is the opportunity identified by the consultant -- ready-to-eat foods -- realistic and relevant for Chennur? Food, in many ways, reflects the core of society's value system. While the Indian consumer is willing to experiment at the periphery, the core meal remains unchanged -- more-or-less traditional, relying on fresh produce, not packaged convenience foods. <BR>&nbsp; Ready-to-eat foods offer convenience, but at the same time, expect a change in mindset of the economy, and freshness-conscious Indian housewife. Moreover, ready-to-eat food products often threaten her role as the family's provider and efficient manager of the kitchen.&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="67%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; Hence, the evaluation of this business appears impatient and does not look at some of the larger issues at play. Second, on what area of competency will Chennur enter ready-to-eat foods? The more logical choices would be other commodity food products (Chennur might be adept at handling low value-added, high volume, low margin products) or beverages (it may have consumer insights or distribution strengths through long-term experience). What it perhaps doesn't have is the technological expertise or consumer insight in the area of culinary products to move into ready-to-eat foods. <BR>&nbsp; Given all these issues, one is almost tempted to rephrase the question: "Why not ready-to-eat foods?" to "why ready-to-eat foods?" Chennur will be able to generate long term, sustainable growth only by leveraging its current organisational strengths and expertise. </TD>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="33%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\209.GIF"> </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;&nbsp; First, Chennur must innovate and renovate within its current business area to ensure that it remains competitive in tea and drives real internal growth. <BR>Within its existing business territory, it needs to identify changes and trends in consumer behaviour that will offer growth opportunities (for example, ice tea or flavoured tea). When it comes to expanding its operations, the cost of entering a new category can't be left undefined. New business should strengthen the parent firm by offering operating synergies. In short, Chennur must stay focused on where its competencies lie. That doesn't mean it should only market tea. It must continue to innovate or renovate its tea business and enter areas where it can leverage its experience. Is a separate company necessary to provide focus and the environment for growth? The consultant's view that when it comes to entering a new category we need to carefully nurture the new business venture is well taken. However, we must not swing to the opposite extreme wherein we increase complexity of operations and risk the core business. <BR>&nbsp; What is critical is to create an environment and a mindset within the organisation that encourages growth. In order to ensure that new business is given the opportunity to grow, we need to develop an independent vision and business structure for it. But its vision must be derived from the larger vision of the parent organisation. The relevant business model, therefore, is not the creation of an independent company but setting up an independent operation within the parent company, and a change in organisational mindset to one that supports growth and nurtures the new operation. That means: <BR>&nbsp; * A revitalised organisation that exploits its current strengths and is focused on its core competencies. <BR>&nbsp; * Is governed by a clear vision that defines its goals. <BR>&nbsp; * That invests in its future by drawing on its past. </TD></TR>

<TD width="90%" colSpan=4><A target="_parent" class=punch>For Recovery to make a mark, it has to be positioned as a hospital brand which is customer-responsive. But then how does one position a health service?</A></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="90%" colSpan=4>&nbsp;<I> This is a two-part case study on positioning and image management in the health sector. In this issue, we look at the positioning issues of Recovery Clinics, while the next case will examine the image problems at Karuna Hospitals, some of whose doctors have left to set up Recovery.</I> </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Pulin Kayastha was simply amazed. He had seen all forms of hostility and marketing warfare in the consumer goods industry, but to see similar warfare in the health industry fascinated him. Clearly, he told himself, doctors had found consumers in their patients. At least, that's what the concept note sent by Dr Ajit Varman, country manager of Recovery Clinics &amp; Hospitals, seemed to indicate. Varman and seven other senior doctors had left Karuna Nursing home and hospital to set up Recovery, which, as the note said, "...would be entirely devoted and dedicated to customer responsiveness." <BR>&nbsp; Pulin was a management consultant and was recommended to Recovery by the marketing director of Regrow Pharma, a large pharmaceuticals company in Mumbai. In fact, the suggestion to set up Recovery came from a non-resident patient, Dinesh Shah, who was undergoing treatment at Karuna's large speciality hospital in central India. It was in the course of his interaction with the doctors that Shah sensed their unhappiness with the system. This prompted him to suggest the idea of Recovery. Varman had joined Karuna 10 years ago, assured of a challenging career in a hospital that was promising to be different and driven. But over time, disillusionment set in as Karuna's image and response to the environment diluted its equity. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; &nbsp; "Now that we have decided to do this, we do not want to repeat old mistakes," Varman had told Pulin during their first meeting. "Having worked at Karuna, we can see its weaknesses and why it's losing saliency. Ten years ago, when it was established, we believed it was going to add value to our careers. We became a part of it because we were told that we were specialists who would bring exclusivity to the hospital. But soon, the focus shifted to fetching business and revenues. The management started hiring specialists and private practitioners, offering them cabins and consultancy arrangements at Karuna. The strategy was that these doctors would bring in their patients and use the infrastructure so that the hospital would start earning money."&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; The Karuna management wanted to derive short-term benefits, than gradually build up clientele. But the strategy, it appeared, did not pay off. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="78%" colSpan=3>&nbsp;As Varman said: "Because there were many doctors and the business was not large enough in the first few months. Consequently, competition for business became cut-throat between doctors.'' <BR>&nbsp; Despite modern amenities, state-of-the-art systems and numerous doctors, the image of the hospital was that of being too commercial -- a fallout of the stigma of being a private hospital. It was common among doctors to slot every hospital under either category -- a place where you get neglected to death or a place where you get researched to death. Karuna earned a new label -- a place where you got cross-referred to death, for doctors at Karuna slowly took to enhancing each others' earnings as they sent patients back and forth to doctors and specialists. At the end of his diagnoses, the patient ended up paying a huge amount of money for his treatment. </TD>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="25%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\211.GIF"> </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; According to Varman, the high-cost, high-expectation syndrome hit the hospital. The initial promise of exclusivity and quality was lost. Karuna had the best doctors, but after-care was abysmal. With a view to keeping costs low, nurses, housekeeping staff and even the front office staff were hired cheap, training was virtually absent, and no attention was paid to end-user needs. <BR>&nbsp; Kayastha could see Recovery trying to be all that Karuna was not and desiring not to be all that Karuna was. If Kayastha thought Varman was hiring him for routine systems design and a patient management manual, he was mistaken.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; For Varman said: "We want to get Recovery's positioning platform right and work on a sound marketing plan. What we want you to do is to help us build this brand, help ordinary doctors like us understand what brand-building entails and how it is managed in a service industry." <BR>&nbsp; The following day, armed with his primary understanding of Recovery's concept, Kayastha met Varman. "There are a number of issues that have cropped up since I sent you my concept note," said Varman. "While we have an overall strategy in place, I feel our success will hinge on two key factors: a) our organisation structure and b) our marketing strategy. <BR>&nbsp; "As I mentioned earlier, Shah has taken three buildings of a charitable hospital trust where his father is the chief trustee. Fundamentally, the buildings are okay, we have renovated the plumbing and electrical systems. The equipment has been ordered and we have already hired a top drawer bio-medical engineer. In another six months, the place should be ready to function. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5><A target="_parent" class=punch>'For recovery to avoid the mistakes that karuna made and build its brand, it will have to get the positioning platform right and work on a sound marketing plan' </A></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; "But we are faced with a dilemma on what our organisational structure should be. The one at Karuna was not delivering. I have been reading modern management thinkers, but I still have some issues to contend with. At the very outset, who should be the CEO of Recovery? Should a doctor be at the helm or a professional manager, or like most hospitals, should he be from medical services? Then again what should be the role of the director of medical services (DMS)? I believe their roles overlap and may create problems. So, do we need two functionaries or can they be rolled into one?" <BR>&nbsp; "What is the role of the DMS?" asked Kayastha. <BR>&nbsp; "A DMS decides on the equipment, medical services to be provided, deals with problems that doctors confront," said Varman. "In short, he is a strategist and a business manager. At Karuna, the DMS has the medical department heads like pathology, radiology etc reporting to him, while these men also have a dotted line to the CEO. <BR>&nbsp; "The CEO is the man the DMS reports to, as do all other functional heads, like the head of foods and beverages, marketing and finance. Some hospitals have also created a super head called the managing director to whom the CEO reports. Will this structure help? Because I do feel that having a DMS and a CEO creates two parallel power structures and disharmony, not to mention unnecessary approvals and sanctions." "Why do you say that?" asked Kayastha.<BR>&nbsp; "Let me explain," said Varman. "At Karuna, we had a DMS who was a doctor, a CEO who was from the hotel industry. What we found was that if the doctors wanted a new medical service in place, and the DMS did not approve, they would negotiate with the CEO, the system allowed for that. Once he said yes the DMS had no say in it. If you look at their roles, both have a different orientation. The CEO looks at numbers, not consumer needs. Numbers should not always be the criterion for setting up a new department. For instance, number logic will tell you that the investment should go into cardiology for that is my profit centre, whereas the DMS, based on his knowledge of health needs, might feel that money should go into, say, orthopedics -- so if you leave it to the CEO, you might get what is good today, and not what will be needed in the next 10 years. So, there were always these clashes." </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="20%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\212.GIF"> </TD>
<TD width="80%" colSpan=3>&nbsp;"Should doctors," continued Varman, "manage departments or should professional managers do it? Should the F&amp;B cell have a doctor above the F&amp;B manager, for instance?"Karuna, explained Varman, had an F&amp;B man who was brought in from the hotel industry. "He comes from an industry where creativity and imagination is the USP, but for hospitals, it is nutrition. I am wondering whether it was a bad idea to take someone from an industry where the function has such a radically different slant, rip all that learning off him and ask him to focus on nutrition! He isn't prepared for that. So, should we get someone who is a dietician?<BR>&nbsp; "Then again, in the hotel industry," said Varman, "F&amp;B is a profit centre. In a hospital, F&amp;B is a no-profit, no-loss department and the F&amp;B head doesn't get spoken about. It is really the difference in the trades, but where do we strike a balance?" </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Karuna had adopted the hospitality industry model, probably because its managing director was from the hotel industry. "That may be one model," said Varman, "but it has its downside. The department managers of the hospital were managers from hotels, from banks, other companies etc. But none of them had any knowledge of the hospital business. While both hotels and hospitals symbolise care and comfort, hospitals are also about compassion and tolerance." It was worse in the case of marketing, explained Varman. <BR>&nbsp; The marketing team was chosen from the pharmaceuticals trade -- which was trained to sell products to doctors. "Here you are selling neither to doctors nor to organised customer groups," said Varman. ''The marketing team used the tried model of the doctor route, whereas the doctors aren't the only opinion leaders for a hospital," said Varman. "If you look hard, you will find that the true opinion leaders are the users themselves! So Karuna's marketing men became sales guys without a vision of where the brand should be or its positioning. They came from pharmaceutical firms and there you don't position a drug. You sell a drug for a specific illness. There is no positioning involved. You get the doctor to prescribe your brand and if he does, the patient will necessarily use it. "But when you are looking at the health industry you have to talk about positioning, make the branding focused. And that is what they did not do. Instead, they went to doctors and corporates and said, "look, we have MRI scans, we have so and so doctor", but what they did not talk about and, therefore, not sell, was the service aspect. They were talking about features, but not brand benefits! What they forgot or ignored was that those features could be easily acquired by anybody who can spend money!" <BR>&nbsp; Kayastha heard intently, as Varman continued: "So what they ended up selling was a product, whereas they needed to sell a service. As a hospital that claims to be a specialty unit, you're expected to have X-ray machines, MRI scanners and blood oxygenators. What's your USP is the way you administer healthcare. Does a toothpaste firm say we have automated tube-filling machines? That's only a part of how the product is produced, isn't it? In just the same way, our machines and equipment are only about how we produce our service, but it isn't the service itself. Having said that, how should we market or even define our service, based on all that I have said so far?"<BR>&nbsp; Kayastha could see Varman's anxiety clearly. "What is service?" he, therefore, asked. "You pick up a need that people have and fulfill it. In the case of Recovery, you must address how you will fulfill it. For that you keep talking about the consumer's need all the time. That's how Airtel sells its service. Airtel sells you your need to talk to people.&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="75%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; It says, 'use our service and this is why...' It will never sell you airtime without selling you your need. Therefore, airtime is the means to fulfilling the service. But what it sell is your need."<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Varman was delighted. "The problem at Karuna was," he said, "the marketing people sold the product without highlighting the need. The need those days was, 'I should not be investigated unnecessarily, I should be diagnosed by courteous doctors, I should be informed about my illness.' Although that need was being fulfilled at Karuna, it was not being sold! Karuna even has a mission statement on customer care, but where in all this do you see it being realised? It was not exemplified either in the selling or in its behaviour. That was the USP which was not communicated and eventually lost. </TD>
<TD width="25%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\213.GIF"> </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; "Instead Karuna's care level came down to this, 'Sit down, fill this form, you will have to wait, pay in advance, bring your doctor's reference...' Because we did not have competition we behaved like a monopoly -- take it or leave it. In fact, I'd even say that we got that attitude early on when suddenly everyone was talking about us, everyone wanted to consult at Karuna, everyone wanted to even get their common colds treated by us. We peaked suddenly... and plateaued equally fast,'' said Varman, wistfully. <BR>&nbsp; Kayastha was curious. "What caused this?" he asked. <BR>&nbsp; "I think it was the nursing staff strike last year," said Varman. "A small situation blew out of proportion. We had a patient, who was very ill, also very wealthy. So naturally, he came with the expectation that his money should be respected and value must be delivered. A nurse who came in to sponge him, inadvertently brought in water that was not warm enough. The patient was annoyed, he yelled at the nurse, the nurse was curt and abrasive, that made the patient madder, he called the doctor on his cellphone and let out his grievances. The doctor, of course, took his own time to come, he didn't think it was an emergency, but when he did come, he called in the nurse, blasted her and later suspended her. The next thing we knew, the entire nursing staff went on strike. It shook Karuna's management, they had not expected this!" <BR>&nbsp; Varman felt the situation was a result of poorly defined jobs, roles and authorities. "We need to craft our HR policies on lines of corporate entities, so that there is no role that is nebulous," he said. "In that case, they made the nurse the scapegoat, when, in fact, it was the doctor's fault for not being there on call. So you can see how HR functioned at Karuna." </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5><A target="_parent" class=punch>'Recovery can derive its equity from its doctors and the after-care. also, like any other product, it too will need a good distribution network to deliver its services' </A></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Varman was clear that Recovery would derive its equity from its doctors and the after care, which he said was very high on their list of key result areas. "Our equity will be the doctors and our care givers -- the nursing staff, so we will headhunt and hand-pick our professional team," he said. "But yes, like any other product, we too will need a good distribution network to deliver our services. We will not indulge in franchising like Karuna did. That leads to dilution of quality. Karuna gave its name to some 15 clinics and nursing homes and called them 'recognised by Karuna'. That was foolish because none of those doctors are from the clinic, they don't even know what comprised quality.&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Two, their diagnosis methods and treatment may not be in line with how we would do it. Patient handling cannot be handled like a computer institute. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But we will set up feeder units in far-flung places or even around the city which will be #our# clinics and the doctors will be #our# paid doctors who will conduct the initial examination and primary treatment at the clinic."&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp; And that was where Varman derived the USP for Recovery. "We want to be more customer-responsive," he now said. "We believe that is what the consumer needs. As doctors, we can no more concern ourselves with the ailment only to the isolation of the patient as a human being with needs. But you have to take that apart and detail its constituents for us, so that we can convert them into actual features. For instance, if we want to be humane, we must not talk about bills first, but address the admission issue first. At Karuna, when a patient is being wheeled in, the staff ask for a deposit or mode of payment. Naturally, we will build in our own checks and balances. Therefore, you will also have to design for us a comprehensive system which will handle patient management capably.&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="20%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\214.GIF"> </TD>
<TD width="80%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; "Thus, we want to decrease the number of days' stay in the hospital without compromising on treatment. Neither do we want patients to go through meaningless investigations. Our promise to people will be a conjoint examination, which will reduce investigations."<BR>&nbsp; "And what do you have in mind?" asked Kayastha. <BR>&nbsp; "We plan to set up conjoint clinics," said Varman. "Which means, rather than have departments of this or that, we will look at the composite service. Thus, in case of a heart problem, you will be seen by both the cardiologist and the cardiothoracic surgeon, as also the dietician and the lifestyle-change specialist -- all in one room, they will evaluate you and present a conjoint treatment.So, it will be a comprehensive solution-based treatment rather than one by trial and error. Yes, you will pay slightly extra to be managed by a team, but look at what you get. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; &nbsp; "We are planning to introduce the patient management concept, which is what a patient really needs. At Karuna, what we find are a lot of specialists but when a patient is admitted he has usually more than one problem." <BR>&nbsp; Explaining this, Varman went on to detail a case of patient mismanagement filed against Karuna. This cancer patient was going through chemotherapy, dialysis, had undergone a stomach surgery for cancer, apart from which he was also a heart patient. "So he had a kidney doctor, a chemotherapist, a cardiologist -- each with an orientation skewed to his area of expertise. As a result, no single doctor knew his case and each doctor was making suggestions that were not compatible with the other treatment. And when he died, no one could pinpoint the cause. But I do believe that there should be one overall patient manager doctor who can understand what the specialist is recommending and audit it against other complications." <BR>&nbsp; Kayastha had by now understood the broad aspects of Recovery's product. Varman was saying, "Karuna made the mistake of not positioning its product. In fact, I didn't think their product had a definition. Nor was there a marketing effort. What there was, was a frantic revenue drive, which resulted in loss of credibility. Now that I have told you our proposed profile, how do we go about positioning our product so that our uniqueness and our customer responsiveness stay salient as attributes in the minds of customers?" </TD></TR>

<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;&nbsp; Fame and revenue are both important for a good enterprise and are not mutually exclusive with customer care and medical excellence. With proper planning and sound marketing the prospect of establishing such an enterprise is bright. The case focuses on Varmans worry with regard to the positioning of Recovery. The problem can be tackled on multiple fronts by Varman, namely, through the marketing department, by way of internal marketing and administrative systems.<BR>&nbsp; The marketing department can play a crucial role in portraying the image of Recovery as a hospital which provides excellent medical treatment and complete customer care in an exclusive environment. The image is sure to strike a chord with the consumer. Having achieved the quality of services targeted by Varman, the focus will rest on communicating this to the consumer. This will entail designing appropriate marketing strategies. The strategies may include organising continuous medical education programmes aimed at doctors in cities to reinforce its image as an excellent medical provider, launching schemes for eye or kidney donation which will project its humanitarian outlook and render a caring image to the hospital. Recovery must also have a strong public relations department. Patients feedback must be obtained on a daily basis and their grievances attended to. </TD></TR>

<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; The hospital staff will play an important role in reaffirming the profile promised to consumers by the marketing department. To ensure that right message is communicated to the patient, it is vital that the staff understand and internalise the hospitals mission. Internal marketing is crucial in the service industry and every employee whos interacting with the consumer must market its services. This will help in building brand image. Courteous staff, particularly in the frontline departments, nurses trained not only in clinical management but also in patient interaction must be able to meet patients demands and convey the feeling that the hospital exists for the patient. If satisfied patients are to be made opinion leaders they may actually assume an important role as Recoverys salesforce.<BR>&nbsp; To ensure that the hospital staff look after patients, it has to be empowered to meet patients demands. A system of administration designed by keeping the patient as the central focus, and not the facilitation of internal processes will enable the staff to deliver what the hospital promises. For instance, the extent of authority given to an admissions executive to accept a night admission without the mandatory initial deposit will leave an agreeable impression on the patients mind.<BR>&nbsp; Also, Recovery must regularly train the staff. This will equip staff members to deliver services in a customer-friendly manner. For example, behavioural training and understanding the value of teamwork are suitable programmes for the staff. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="70%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; The other issues raised in the case relating to the organisation structure and staffing pattern can be resolved by understanding that the hospital industry like any other industry the requires professional management. People trained in the field of hospital management should be hired to manage a hospital since they understand the unique nature of its services. The question of having a CEO and director of medical services (DMS) is not an either-or question. A hospital needs technical medical and professional management input, which can be delivered when the CEO and DMS function in coordination. In order to balance the power between the two, the hospital can appoint a technical committee for decisions relating to upgrading any particular department. The committee will be responsible for cost-benefit analysis and determining the feasibility of the suggested plan for starting a new department, or buying expensive equipment. </TD>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="30%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\216.GIF"> </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Recovery can have a managing director who will coordinate the activities of the CEO and DMS and concentrate on strategic planning for the hospital. His function is, thus, distinct from that of the CEO, who is responsible for all non-medical areas and day-to-day operations.<BR>&nbsp; The other issue raised by Varman is the management of doctors. Taking a commission on doctors fees often works adversely, leading to confrontation. The best solution: have a partnership with doctors, which would ensure doctors commitment to the hospital. Similarly, the organisational problem of running an F&amp;B department can be solved by recruiting an F&amp;B manager from the hotel industry who will be responsible for preparation of food as per the dieticians plan. The quality of food will be his responsibility. The hospital also has a choice of outsourcing F&amp;B services. However, even in such a situation, the dietician will remain indispensable.<BR>&nbsp; Varmans idea of having conjoint clinics is ideal and will require a high level of coordination. If coordination fails it could turn into an administration nightmare. Patient management will acquire top priority to ensure patient satisfaction. It would be a good idea to admit the patient under one doctor who refers the patient to other specialists if need be. The specialists must give a feedback in order to ensure comprehensive care. In conclusion, one can say that Recovery can position itself for its customer responsiveness by ensuring commitment by all concerned to the organisational goal and by delivering not only what it promises but more than what it promises. </TD></TR>

<TD width="80%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; <B>Sharanita Keswani</B> <I>is the chief operating officer of strategic marketing consultancy Quadra Advisory.<BR></I><BR>&nbsp; The first thing that I would like to emphasise is that medical services have reached a stage where they need to be treated as an industry. Having said that, the focus for Recoverys CEO is to perceive it as a business, which has been set up to satisfy specific consumers at a profit. My observations are:&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;* Identify the target consumer&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;* Define a clear value proposition<BR>&nbsp;* Develop a unique brand positioning<BR>&nbsp;* Define the structure needed to implement and support the above&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; This analysis will focus on value proposition and brand positioning, which are critical for the clinics strategy. Value proposition: Based on the target consumer, the CEO needs to define a strong value proposition. It is the template that drives all activity in an organisation. It defines the organisations reason for being.To quote Michael J. Lanning, a business or a value proposition is conceived and managed as the intentional delivery of a chosen scenario of resulting experiences to a group of potential customers. The resulting experience includes a series of related (physical or mental) events that happen in the life of the customer due to the action of the business organisation.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; If the enterprise can deliver a superior value proposition at a total cost that is below its revenues, the business succeeds. Varmans first job is to explore value-delivery options; make a choice of a profitable superior value proposition. Thereafter, all functions, departments, specialties teams etc must be designed. Finally, the communication will be delivered through the marketing team and delivery of the proposition by specialists and support staff in the clinic.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5><A target="_parent" class=punch>&nbsp; What recovery needs to do is to strengthen its proposition so that the entire organisation is aligned to delivering the chosen value.</A></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;&nbsp; I think Varman already has a winning proposition in mind  that of a conjoint examination system for patient management. The concept is relevant to consumers, is unique and differentiated from competition. What Recovery needs to do is to strengthen its proposition so that the entire organisation is aligned to delivering the chosen value. Recoverys value proposition can be strengthened by answering the following question: who is my customer? What best alternatives does he or she have? If they do not do business with us, what will they do? We can see that in the case of Karuna, the value proposition had not been defined. There was inadequate consumer understanding, hence, the clinic was not delivering any significant value to its consumers.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the CEO has defined the value proposition, the marketing director needs to translate this into consumer language and develop a unique brand positioning statement. Both value proposition and brand positioning mirror each other and are linked by one common element  the organisations customers. They both draw inspiration from a deep consumer understanding that is focused on satisfying consumer needs in a unique manner and both drive organisational activity. Value proposition is broader, covers all organisational functions, helps to develop a total value delivery system, and is driven by the CEO. The brand positioning will further serve the purpose of defining inputs for communication and brand activity at every point of consumer contact. We define brand positioning as the target consumers reason to buy a brand in preference to others.&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="70%" colSpan=3>&nbsp;The team would need to understand the consumers needs in detail, their motivations, and need gaps, what would truly delight them. Based on the data available, I would like to define some of the elements of Recoverys brand positioning in the following manner:<BR>&nbsp; <B>The target consumer:</B> The Recovery consumer is a male or female, is discerning. The patient is fed up of being cheated by other medical institutions, which bring in specialists who dont have a forum to confer the right treatment.<BR>&nbsp; <B>Core proposition:</B> A holistic, patient care system with well-coordinated patient management teams.<B><BR>&nbsp; The patients functional reasons to buy:</B> The Recovery clinic has a well-coordinated facility for patient care, it has strong patient management teams, which take care of each patient as a separate client account. It has world-class facilities and equipment, and has trained doctors.</TD>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="30%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\218.GIF"> </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; <B>Emotional reasons to buy:</B> When I go to Recovery, I have total faith that the treatment will be holistic. I wont be neglected, I feel reassured that the staff truly cares for my well being. Brand supports or reasons to believe the brand claims: The clinic has been set up by experienced professionals, it has world-class facilities, trained doctors and nurses, very conducive environment  top-class hygiene standards; pleasant surroundings, patient recreation and recovery facilities.<BR>&nbsp; <B>The brands personality:</B> Recoverys personality is knowledgeable, efficient, transparent and, above all, soft and caring.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; We can see that by defining these brand elements, the marketing director will be able to link these up to define the brand positioning statement. These elements will form the basis for all brand activity. Recovery must have a strong public relations and a focused doctor-contact programme.<BR>&nbsp; The starting point should be the vision statement in the form of a value proposition, developed by the CEO. This, in turn, should be translated into specific brand elements, which would serve the purpose of clearly positioning the brand. The CEO must develop the vision and define a strong value proposition. The CEO must have top management abilities and must be (a) customer-driven (b) highly people-oriented (c) must be both topline and bottomline driver. A medical director who drives the technical function in the hospital must support the CEO. All relevant technical departments must, of course, be manned by medical specialists while support departments like accounts, F&amp;B etc, can draw from other industries. </TD></TR>

<TR>
<TD width="90%" colSpan=4>&nbsp; Jatin Pandya rolled the ad copy line over and over in his mind. Something rankled. "The best fitness and health plan for you from Ambrosia fruit juices -- real fruit, real juice and no sugar!" went the main copy line. Jatin felt uneasy. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; "Something is wrong here," he said to Armaan Arya, the marketing manager. "Can we say 'best for health' when we know it contains preservatives and food colour?"<BR>&nbsp; "What's wrong with that?" asked Armaan. "It ceases to be the best, that is what is wrong," replied Jatin. <BR>&nbsp; "But that is hyperbole," pointed out Armaan. "All the detergent brands say 'best washes'. It is a manner of communicating the superiority of your brand." <BR>&nbsp; "You are talking about health, not fabric," said Jatin. "You could say 'a great way to plan your fitness drive' or some such thing. You are saying real juice, real fruit, no sugar... but you have not said 'and preservatives and food colour'. All you need is for a consumer to contest your claim."<BR>&nbsp; Armaan thought, then said, "Let's get a legal opinion, if that is your fear." <BR>&nbsp; Their lawyer Chetan Kaul said: "Advertising is a means of giving the consumer information, promoting competition in a market, thus offering alternative choices to the consumer. False advertising is when you say x=y and that isn't true. But if the ad is misleading, that falls in the ambit of unfair trade practice."<BR>&nbsp; Pointing to the ad copy for Ambrosia, Jatin asked, "Would you say this statement can mislead a consumer to believe that Ambrosia is best for health?" Armaan interrupted. "We are not saying Ambrosia is best for your health. The words are health and fitness plan. That is different."<BR>&nbsp; "Hyperbole like best, fairest, are permissible," said Kaul. "This is something a consumer will not take seriously -- and that is the issue. When Brand X says its television is the best, the consumer knows it is in a manner of speaking and he does not truly believe that Brand X is the best. But when a company tries to give credibility to its claim, it goes beyond mere hyper. Like if you say I am the best toothpaste because I score 98% whereas others score 80%, then that is a claim you are making and it goes beyond mere hyperbole. Then you are trying to give it a scientific basis. That enters the realm of false advertising. It is a misrepresentation under the MRTP Act.''<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; ''Ambrosia may pass the legal test," said Jatin, "but ethically speaking, it won't be correct."<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; "But you are not making a claim," said Kaul.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="75%" colSpan=3>"Then see this," said Jatin, pulling out another campaign for Ambrosia which showed a fitness instructor of repute, holding a tetrapack of Ambrosia Orange, and his words were, 'I trust Ambrosia for my fitness and good health...' "Now isn't that a claim on behalf of the brand?" asked Jatin.&nbsp; "Depends... if he is an expert," said Kaul. "If he was a doctor, a nutritionist or a dietician, then those words could be deemed a claim made by an expert and could be contested. For example, if a doctor says Ambrosia is very good for health, the point is, has he really conducted a test? If he has, then has he conducted it in an independent manner? Has he done the test to deliver a certain result, was he financed by somebody? That will be considered an unfair trade practice. If a consumer complains that the ad is misleading or damaging, the MRTP Commission could grant an injunction that the ad be withdrawn." </TD>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="25%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\220.GIF"> </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;&nbsp; Armaan thought for a while. There was another campaign which lauded tetrapack drinks, stating that drinks in bottles stood a greater chance of contamination. At its heart, the campaign was part of Ambrosia's fitness and health positioning. But now he wondered if that could be contested by manufacturers of bottled drinks.<BR>&nbsp; "Comparative advertising is healthy, but you must be clear about the claims you make," said Kaul. "Clearly, you are saying Ambrosia is good because it comes in a tetrapack and bottled drinks are not as good. This is a direct attack on bottled drinks. Companies do not reveal all the parameters they have considered in arriving at their conclusion of 'best'. You may select some major ones. But the company may choose to highlight the trivial ones and ignore the major ones. These things happen and these are not strictly speaking provided under the law. To establish unfair trade practice, there must be prima facie evidence of damage or misrepresentation." <BR>&nbsp; "We are legally safe," said Armaan. "We will re-word this campaign, but our other campaigns have passed muster."<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; But Jatin felt the other ads were misleading too. "We have to also take an ethical view," he said. "Legally you may not be making a claim, but please hear what your ad says." The Ambrosia TV commercial showed an ailing old man. His wife gets ready to extract juice from some oranges, but the daughter-in-law sweeps all that aside and pours out Ambrosia.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Said Jatin, "This ad says to me: 'Ambrosia is convenient, Ambrosia is as good as fresh oranges, Ambrosia is good for the ailing.' That misleads."<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't be absurd," said Armaan, "The proposition here is convenience." "Don't forget your primary platform is health and fitness," pointed out Jatin. " And in this convenience campaign you are creating an impression of 'also good for health'. I believe that as responsible advertisers, we have to be more concerned about the ethical than merely the legal. Many advertisers are resorting to this ploy. Take the ad for Signor Hair dye. The TV commercial shows a lady in a white overcoat, sitting behind a huge glass table, telling a consumer, 'But Signor is good for your hair...' </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5><A target="_parent" class=punch>'The use of an expert lends credibility to an advertisiment's claim and comfort to the consumer. It is this sense of comfort that persuades the consumer to use the product' </A></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;&nbsp; "What they have done is created an 'impression' of the lady being a doctor. That is misleading. You may be educated, literate, but if you are lulled into believing it is a doctor, then that certainly does give you comfort. And it is that sense of comfort which persuades you to use the brand."<BR>&nbsp; "But tell me," said Armaan, "where do they say she is a doctor? Did she carry a stethoscope? Did you see a red cross? So many people wear white coats! Scientists, lab assistants..."<BR>&nbsp; "Let's be fair Armaan," said Jatin. "The intention was to give you comfort. Otherwise why the white coat? In this ad the frame showing the lady appeared for exactly four seconds, during which time you saw a huge glass table, a white overcoat, a sterile sort of environment, not a boutique, or a school or a playground. You see a person who has the bearing of a person in a position of authority.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now how does the viewer's mind work? The whole power of persuasion, which is what advertising seeks to play on, works on certain set images we have developed over time about doctors, teachers, housewives and white coats. Why do all toothpaste ads use men in white coats? The white coat creates an illusion in your mind that this is coming from a position of authority, from an expert.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then again, look at the overall presentation. There is a diffident consumer, shy and inhibited who asks, 'but what about my skin, eyes?' And this lady who is shown in a position of authority says, 'Brand X is good...' The whole thing was a flash of three seconds and done so expertly that you were left with the impression that the medical opinion is that that dyes do not harm you."<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Jatin had by now won the interest of both Kaul and Armaan. He went on stating his point, "Now can you see how it misleads? From a legal viewpoint, 'Signor is good ...' does not make a claim. But it is a response to 'but my eyes...?' Sit on the viewer's chair and listen to the message that comes through. What you hear is 'as for your eyes, no harm will come if you use Signor'. And the point is viewers receive messages from the words, visuals and the general environment in the ad. It is the message that persuades and that message has to be ethically correct. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="20%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\221.GIF"> </TD>
<TD width="80%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; "Then again, by putting that woman behind the table and lending an antiseptic aura to the environment, you have tried to pass her off as a doctor or researcher. Of course legally there is nothing there that indicates she is a doctor or that it is a clinic. But when you see that frame which lasts 3-4 seconds, sure enough the feeling is she is a person of medical authority. Again, legally safe, but ethically damaging. You have tried to create an impression of authority, of a clinical environment.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's like this: in a court of law you will lose if you try to claim damages for being misled. But the fact is you tried to persuade the consumer with the use of an amiable voice behind a glass table, which person is clearly not your Vim-using housewife, not your Dove-using beauty... So who is she? </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly a credible voice of authority. Believable, because she is advising the use of the brand in the manner of an advisor. Isn't that enough? Then again why address eyes if you did not already think that was an area of consumer resistance? By replying with 'Signor is good...' you have sought to pass that off as an answer to a nagging consumer anxiety. It's blatant!&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; Have you put a vast sample of consumers under test for six or seven years to validate the claim that your dye is not harmful? If they had, believe me they would not have made covert references. They would have screamed from the rooftops that we researched and we now have conclusive proof that it does not harm you.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are so many such instances. Take the ad for Relief tablets for painful joints. They show this lady who is presented as a doctor. Again, there is a white overcoat. She says she has a backache. Another doctor says, 'then you must have a Relief'. She does, and she is soon feeling very good. Then the camera moves back and you see a person with a bandaged leg, on crutches, walking across the frame, helped by someone in white. Now, what impression are you left with? That this is a medical environment, that these people who are conversing are doctors, after all an advertiser would not show two artists or photographers or jewellers talking of painful backs in an environment where there are people in bandages? What is the message that you get from the collage of visuals? 'I am a doctor and I am the one who is using the product'." Armaan's mind was in a whirl. Yes, an attempt was being made to 'create an impression' of comfort and safety with authority. But Ambrosia wasn't doing any of that. "Where is Ambrosia misleading, Jatin?" he asked.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's not 'where', but 'how'," said Jatin. "For that, let us answer the question, who is your ad targeting? Who is watching that ad and receiving messages? Kaul, you and I may discount a white coat. But look at the general viewer. Take a student who has yet to gain the maturity to say 'that ad is trying to overstate an issue'. Or take a clerk in a school. When he watches the hair dye ad he will say, 'Achcha, yeh to doctor saab keh rahen hain. So it must be right.' His worldly experience will lead him to accept the white coat as that of a doctor. Now take Ambrosia's ailing old man ad. My driver or even clerks in our office will see that as an endorsement of 'good for the ailing'." </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="75%" colSpan=3>&nbsp;Jatin's anxiety also stemmed from a recent encounter with his dhobi's wife. She had had a baby after 11 years. Naturally, she and her family wanted to shower it with the best. She said to Jatin's mother, "Bibiji, I have seen an ad, I am giving my baby Brand X health drink. It is supposed to be very good."<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now what do you say to that?" asked Jatin. "That is the segment of the population which is being misled. Don't forget income levels and earning potential have shot up, so a lot more people are using branded products and are being impacted by these ads.&nbsp;Just as you and I aspire to own an LG multiple system refrigerator, they are aspiring to give their kids the best in foods for that is the first level of aspiration in their income class.&nbsp; </TD>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="25%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\222.GIF"> </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;&nbsp; Then again when ads are produced in regional languages, what are you doing? You are targeting the not-so-educated, the not-so-literate. When you say Yeh dil maange more, you are not just targeting the Hinglish-speaking executives, but also the Hindi-speaking belt which covers just about every class and creed of consumer across varying income and education levels. And why not, after all they are today earning much better, however their earning is not matched by a commensurate awareness. So my driver gives his four kids Brand X health drink because it is supposed to be a complete food, little realising that it is so only in a manner of speaking and that a child needs much more.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; "As far as the company is concerned, it may have complied with the rules, but there is an ethical issue here. We may have a very narrow objective of increasing market shares, but at what cost?" he asked. The law needed to also look at the ethics of communication, he felt. Kaul could see the point Jatin was making. "The action that the law can take is not about the dhobi's wife getting misled or confused," he said. "Action is taken if the company makes a wrong claim or a misleading statement. Now the firm can very well say I did not mislead you, you got misled. So, there is a difference between the confusion in the mind of the consumer and willful deception by the company.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; What we are concerned with is positive deception by a company. Now we can have a number of consumers who can say I was misled. I thought this is what the brand does. So what? But has the company given you an impression that this is the claim they are making about their product?" </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5><A target="_parent" class=punch>'A consumer receives messages from words, visuals, and the general environment projected by an advertisement. This message must be ethical because it persuades consumption' </A></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Turning to Armaan, Jatin said, "This is where we come to the line between what is legal and what is ethical. You may be legally on the right side, but your act could be unethical if your ad in words or pictures could lead the consumer to believe something about the product which is not true. Like the bandaged man in crutches in that ad. Or the aura of a doctor in the hair dye ad. Was the bandaged man adding value? The fact it was put there was meant to create an impression that this information or opinion is coming to you from an environment where there are usually people whose opinion you trust as being medically correct. Otherwise why use visuals?" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Armaan agreed. "Ads should have certain parameters," he said. "If it is a quantification ad then the firm should be asked how the numbers have been arrived at. That code for advertising should be validated upfront. Why should the commission not question purported research and numbers even without a complaint being lodged?"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jatin mentioned a food advertisement that showed a PTA meeting discussing the influence of nutrition on a child's intelligence. The headmistress introduces the school nutritionist, a Dr Ravi Khera, who says he has researched four brands and displays his ranking: Brand W 89%, Brand X 72%, Brand Y 66% and Brand Z 50%. The ad which was for Brand X rated it the best because it contained the highest level of fortified vitamins and proteins.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; On probing it was found that the expert had in fact not conducted such a detailed research. Besides, the manner of giving weightages was found to be arbitrary. "That is misrepresentation," agreed Kaul, "To make a tenable claim, your results have to be published in periodicals so that scientists can challenge the validity and then it must be accepted by the body that must also accept the scoring system." </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="20%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\223.GIF"> </TD>
<TD width="80%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; "The point is not about right or wrong only," said Jatin. "It is about making limited claims in a short span of television commercial time and creating an impression that intelligence and mental faculties were dependent on the usage of Brand W. It is about parents who believe in the opinion of a projected expert and feed their children the brand, believing in the authority of the 'expert', and his expertise, in the ranking, that such tests were conducted and finally believing that what they are seeing is the universal truth on foods! In reality, no consumer calls in to ask, 'Now tell me what kind of parameters were tested and what sort of ratings did you use?' No, that does not happen. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; "Likewise, when you say my brand can turn you fair, help you become slim, you are targeting a vulnerable section. Their vulnerability will persuade them to try the product. A young man who is balding is emotionally vulnerable. You can say this product will make his hair grow. He will try the product. The sad part is that he will deny he is trying it, and if there is damage he will not talk about it fearing ridicule. Because it is exactly to stop the ridicule that he is using these nefarious products! Please understand that advertisers who mislead you belong to the same genre of people who ridicule or look down upon baldness. They know you are vulnerable and they will cash in on that mental state. So what view does the law take in these situations?" asked Armaan.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; "You must also consider the environment in which the commission is operating," said Kaul. "Very often marketing warfare has led companies to 'put up' complainants against their rival. The law is aware of this, hence, it does not readily take an extreme view. But in comparative advertising, if Brand X's claim that it scored 98% and Brand Y 70%, is again disputed, it is not enough. Sometimes, the court may not want to go into the details of 'is X better than Y?' After all, they will see if on the face of it such advertising is misleading or damaging. Moreover, when the ad uses an expert like a doctor, usually the MRTP Commission would feel 'they are experts, it is a matter of evidence -- if they say they have conducted these tests it must be true, we cannot stop the advertising'. So, the injunction could be denied. This prompts marketers to use 'experts' in their ads. It is unethical, but there it is.''<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; "I feel the responsibility lies at our doorstep," said Jatin, "to ensure that our ads and communication are ethical. The consumer is not just the literate urbanite anymore. He is also the rural TV watcher. Companies are intelligent bodies. There is underlying consumer faith when you make a statement or create an impression. That trust cannot be abused. Ethics is paramount, even if it passes legal muster. And ethics has to be the driving force behind every organisation." </TD></TR>

<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Can the brand genuinely deliver those benefits or are the claims superficial?<BR>&nbsp; Is the advertising and the brand's intended position being retrofitted to suit an existing brand as happens in most cases, or has the brand been developed with the goal of satisfying real consumer needs?<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Situations in which products are force-fitted into the consumer's life qualify as the seller's approach despite the organisational belief that it is marketing the brand. These are potentially more vulnerable to adopting deceptive communication since they are profit-driven as opposed to value-driven. A true marketing approach which is based on developing products to satisfy felt needs among consumers is intrinsically designed to deliver honest and meaningful value. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5><A target="_parent" class=punch>The best way to ensure that your brand delivers honest value is to show its terminal value, which defines the philosophy behind the brand&nbsp;</A> </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; As a marketing manager, this is the first question Armaan should address. Is Ambrosia truly offering health and fitness benefits, and how? The use of tetrapacks for packaging could certainly be one of the substantiators to allow for retention of freshness and superior hygiene. However, this in itself is, at best, only a peripheral support to the position. It is not central to the formulation or recipe of the product or its performance, and hence, cannot be the only lever on which the fitness and health position rests. What Armaan should be exploring is alternate positioning options rather than developing different executions of advertising if he wants to deliver honest value. Ambrosia could well deliver refreshment or exciting taste more honestly than promising health and fitness. While Armaan might argue that neither of these positions is unique in a growing category environment, there are still several ways in which differentiation can be created on both platforms: by satisfying higher order needs, employing alternative segmentation strategies or using interesting target imagery. Honest value can emanate only from honest performance of the product.<BR>&nbsp; The best way to ensure that your brand actually delivers honest value is to articulate the brand's terminal value, which defines the philosophy and source of inspiration for the brand's existence. If Armaan were to actually attempt writing the brand charter on Ambrosia fruit juices, he might find himself in dialogue with his product development team rather than seeking a legal opinion from Chetan Kaul. Leading from the fitness and health position, it is logical to assume that Ambrosia's terminal value lies in the realm of creating a healthy world. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="72%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; If so, the firm should design and develop products that truly deliver fitness and health-related benefits or else give up that position.<BR>&nbsp; Often the desire to lend competitive advantage to a brand in the absence of real differentiators results in the search for superfluous supports that can lend authority to the brand as in Ambrosia's case. Since the brand is intrinsically incapable of delivering honest value, the marketer is challenged to invent a competitive edge that may or may not exist, but one that will undoubtedly motivate, persuade and even compel unsuspecting and vulnerable consumers to buy the notional benefit that the brand appears to be offering. Absence of a strategic branding approach that results in retrofitting relevance and gainful meaning to a brand lies at the very heart of deceptive advertising.&nbsp; </TD>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="28%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\225.GIF"> </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;&nbsp; It isn't the intention to mislead the consumer that motivates advertisers and marketers to employ subtle verbal or visual 'persuasion boosters' in their communication but rather the lack of something worthy or different to talk about in their product that drives them to adopt such means.&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I must mention that such deception is rarely unintentional. It is carefully crafted to leverage the brand's position in the consumer's mind. As in the ad for Signor hair dye, where the consumer's key concern about the negative effects of hair dye on the eyes is sharply brought into focus, and indirectly addressed to create an implicit impression that Signor is safe for the eyes while others may not be.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; White coats are used to lend authority to the brand in its area of expertise. Unfortunately, the urge to compete in a highly dynamic marketplace where speed of response governs the fortunes of many brands there is little or no time to validate the claims and perceptions being communicated either explicitly or implicitly. Even well-meaning organisations that are research-savvy sometimes succumb to the less arduous route of being legally safe than being guided by ethics in order to ensure that they outperform competition on pace.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; An interesting paradox in the argument that Kaul brings to attention is that "consumers do not take hyperbole seriously". Strangely, that is precisely what any brand employing puffery is trying so hard to achieve. Perhaps, it is this dichotomy that has given birth to the white-coat solution where the marketer hopes to persuade the consumer to take its brand seriously through the silent testimony of the expert in its advertising. It goes without saying that clearly this is an attempt to manipulate consumer action and belief.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; But in the final analysis, the decision about whether or not brands should employ deceptive communication must mainly be governed by organisational culture and brand values. </TD></TR>

Shroff &amp; Co.<BR></I><BR>&nbsp; The present case raises vital legal and ethical issues on product advertising. Today, advertising has become the most important means of empowering consumers with information, giving them alternate choices and promoting healthy competition in the market. Ads reach the most remote parts of India via various media. This reach entails an obligation of responsible advertising. But recently, there has been a growing tendency to exaggerate -- sometimes grossly -- as also to convey half-truths giving responsible advertising the go by. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said this, one notes that there are different kinds of ads and the potential for harm depends on the type of product that is being promoted in the advertisement. For instance, advertisements lending a medical assurance must be based on objective and credible testing because the potential for harm caused by misleading the consumer here is the maximum. The same is true for any other item like food and medicines which may affect the health of the consumer. There is a high ethical and legal obligation on the part of the company to guide and inform the consumer. Misinformation negates information. Ads should not cash in on the gullibility of the general viewer.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Branded products, whether soap or milk products, carry with them an assurance of quality and desired result. There are also comparative advertisements, where one brand touts its superiority to that of rival brands as seen in the toothpaste advertisement of Hindustan Lever Ltd (HLL), which claimed New Pepsodent was superior to Colgate.<BR>&nbsp; The claim of HLL that its product had 102% anti-bacterial superiority was not found to be true. The MRTPC held that the injury caused to public, in general, could not be compensated in terms of money as the feeling of being duped could not be evaluated in monetary terms. (This matter has been referred to a body of experts to verify the claim made by HLL.) Such advertisements must be based on adequate scientific data. In quantification advertisements, the figures and the numbers mentioned in the advertisement must be authentic. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5><A target="_parent" class=punch>&nbsp; Companies have a high ethical obligation to guide the consumer. Advertisements should not cash in on the consumer's gullibility</A></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ethical aspect of an ad is as important as its legal aspect. Ads use the media to persuade consumers and enable them to make a choice in the open market. That is why it is incumbent on the company not to mislead even by silence or omission.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Legally, a false statement regarding a particular standard, quality, grade, composition, model, is an unfair trade practice under section 36A of the Monopolies &amp; Restrictive Trade Practices (MRTP) Act. As laid down by the Supreme Court in National Lakhanpal's case, the object of section 36A is to introduce honesty in the relationship between the manufacturer and the consumer. When a problem arises as to whether a particular act can be condemned as an unfair trade practice, the key to the solution would be to examine whether it contains a false statement and is misleading. What effect does such a representation have on the consumer? Does it lead buyers to wrong conclusions?<BR>&nbsp; In the US, the law under the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914 has declared 'unfair methods of competition' as unlawful. The US courts in various cases have held false and unsubstantiated advertising claims to be unlawful. The Perrier group was prohibited from falsely advertising that its sparkling mineral water was not processed or filtered before being bottled and from making false claims regarding the manner in which the water was carbonated. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="72%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; The issue can't be resolved by merely examining whether the representation is correct or incorrect in the literal sense. The position will have to be viewed with objectivity, in an impersonal manner. It is the impact on a viewer that is decisive.<BR>&nbsp; This case deals with the ad campaign of Ambrosia which contains information that is misleading: "The best fitness and health plan for you from Ambrosia fruit juices -- real fruit, real juice and no sugar." The hyperbole exaggerates the quality and credibility far beyond the reality. Equally, its claim that it is superior to freshly-extracted juice, by calling it real fruit, real juice and no sugar, seeks to conceal that it contains harmful ingredients like preservatives and colour. This advertisement, therefore, squarely attracts the provisions of unfair trade practice under the MRTP Act. </TD>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="28%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\227.GIF"> </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;&nbsp; The second advertisement shows the fitness instructor of repute holding a tetrapack of Ambrosia Orange which reads: "I trust Ambrosia for my fitness and health.'' The advertisement is certainly designed to induce a consumer to rely on Ambrosia in preference to "natural fruit juice" for fitness and good health. Prima facie, this advertisement is contrary to the legal and ethical obligation required in a fair advertisement. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;&nbsp; The third ad on the TV showed an ailing old man. His wife gets ready to extract juice from some oranges, but his daughter-in-law sweeps that aside and pours out Ambrosia for the old man. Convenience for a consumer is important but the efficacy of the product is more important. Clearly, the advertisement assures an ailing man that Ambrosia is a healthier drink.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case of the advertisement for Signor Hair Dye, the advertisement suggests firstly that the hair dye is effective. Secondly, it is safe both for the skin and the eyes. It dodges the question of safety of the skin and the eyes by saying that it is a good brand. The advertisement conceals more than it reveals, clearly attracting the mischief of unfair trade practice. What is important is that the companies promote campaigns conscious of their legal and ethical duties. Is a consumer who purchases a product not entitled to fairness from the company?<BR>&nbsp; Companies marketing products like hair dyes, vitality pills etc., are not aware that they have a captive market and a vulnerable consumer. If these companies misrepresent facts, it would amount to unfair trade practice. </TD></TR>

<TD width="90%" colSpan=4><A target="_parent" class=punch>Three years and Rs 17 crore later, mebrisk India discovered its system revamp was a completely futile exercise? But was it so profitless after all? </A></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="90%" colSpan=4>&nbsp; Adip Arya was disconsolate. Plan Revamp, the system he had partly engineered, and put in place painstakingly four years ago, was today being torn to shreds by the new director of operations of Mebrisk India, Kevin Mathais. To make matters worse, Kevin had asked Adip: "Why have you done this? What did you save?" </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; They had debated it for three days. The verdict was that Rs 17 crore which the company had spent on Plan Revamp was unnecessary. Uniquely, at the end of the three days, Adip could not fault Kevin's arguments. Worse, he even conceded that the old system could work, albeit with some changes. <BR>&nbsp; Confused and troubled, Adip met Hemant Trivedi, his boss and general manager (commercial). "How is it that I did not think about it?" he lamented. Hemant smiled. "Such is change," he said. "Three years ago, could we have even thought about getting yesterday's sales and stocks position in by today morning and at every location? It was unimaginable! Today, you have forgotten what it was like not to have information in real time." <BR>&nbsp; The events of the last four years flashed before Adip. It all started in 1997 when operations and finance was taken over by Parthiv Vyas. Parthiv was bothered by the climate of competition that had seized the environment. More than that, Parthiv, who came from an entirely commercially-driven environment at Delaware where he was general manager (operations), was irked by the virtual inertia of commercial at Mebrisk. The tug-of-war that raged year after year between sales and production could have been prevented if only commercial had been proactive, he felt. <BR>&nbsp; Almost immediately Parthiv told his team: "I am going to change you from being bean counters to businessmen. First, I am going to question everything that you have been doing. What is our working capital doing for us?"<BR>&nbsp; They went through a nerve-wracking exercise, at the end of which, Parthiv declared, "I want a zero or negative working capital. And this is how: one-month credit from the suppliers, a business cycle that is less than a month, and before you have paid for the raw materials you should recover money from debtors, thin stock positions say, three to four days, to allow for transit time and you will be making money out of thin air." </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="75%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; Parthiv ran a fine toothcomb over every activity in the supply chain. Arduous debates later, he said: "I will ask my vendor to supply me on a just-in-time (JIT) basis. Every morning, every factory must be able to tell the vendor what it plans to make in the next three days, and that is what the vendor will supply. But at every factory, the mantra for inventories will be JIT. On the distribution side, he found that the production plan was not in sync with the sales plan. Parthiv blamed the performance parameters of the factories: man hours per tonne, machine hours per tonne and idle capacity reduction.&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; So, the factories produced what they desired irrespective of what the market needed, while proudly displaying never-before rates of man hours per tonne. </TD>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="25%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\229.GIF"> </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;&nbsp; And how did they do this? Irrespective of stockpiles in their stores, they produced what was good for the health of their performance indicators. "No wonder your closing stock of finished goods is made up of mostly large packs, while sales demand stands unmet for smaller pack sizes," pointed Parthiv. <BR>&nbsp; Annoyingly, no one would take ownership for the unsold stocks. The sales team said they had not asked for it. The production department said it was exactly as per plans. And the difference between sales forecast and actual sales was usually 60%. <BR>&nbsp; But these forecasts became the template for everything that transpired at Mebrisk, for production planning, ordering inventories... The whole pipeline got disrupted, and consequently, everybody pitched for higher safety stocks. "Can you see?" asked Parthiv. "One frantic phone call from Dibrugarh for 1,000 1-kg packs of cooking oil invariably sent the whole system into convulsions, resulting in frenzied stock movements from one depot to another, from one factory to another and unscheduled ordering of raw materials. And the unbeatable explanation for forecasts? 'But the markets are so dynamic!' '' mimicked Parthiv. <BR>&nbsp; "And you commercial men should have blazed your radar on the factories and examined why they did not carry stock as per forecasts!" said Parthiv. The resistance to changing the production plan was endemic in the system, from the factory manager who watched his machine hour per tonne to the workers who watched their bonus for delivering a certain productivity, which was measured in man hours per tonne. So, everyone resisted change. </TD></TR>

<TD width="100%" colSpan=5><A target="_parent" class=punch>'Early man didn't wait for James Watt to fire the steam engine to cover distances. He used a crude version of an angular plane, the wheel, the horse, and i'd say that's what powered watt to think steam' </A></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Parthiv was demanding a paradigm shift. "What I found is, if the sales forecast reached on time, it was incorporated into the production plan. If it did not reach by the fourth or fifth day of the planning cycle, production plans went ahead on their own. Naturally. So the first thing to do is to connect everybody -- factories with depots to regions to head office."Permissions and sanctions simply fell in place as Parthiv ordered every location to be provided with V-Sat connections at a huge cost, wiring the entire company across the country. The result was unbelievable. The information on stock levels reached head office every morning.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Parthiv went on: "If I have to plan production for tomorrow, I must have data today." There were gasps blew across the length and breadth of the company. The men's room mantra went, 'Parthiv has flipped it.' <BR>&nbsp; Truth was that he hadn't. Data flowed in miraculously, much to the amazement of the team which slaved on it night and day. Parthiv's vision stayed: everyday's production had to be planned. Nothing would be produced if it was not planned. In other words, he was going to reduce the production planning cycle from one month to one week, and eventually, to one day. <BR>&nbsp; He did not stop at that. The company had a mix of products and pack sizes that were either slow moving or fast moving. Since demand varied erratically for its hygiene products and ready-to-cook products, it created bottlenecks in the production and trucking plans. It was worse in the case of small volume items like talcum powder. Thus, for instance, if he had 15 stock points in the country, then talcum powder had to be stocked at these points. The transport logistics demanded that a full truck be sent. As a result, the factories dispatched 150 tonnes of talc, when, in fact, the annual sales was just 22 tonnes. "That means we produce and stock eight times!" said Parthiv.<BR>&nbsp; Parthiv declared that it made sense to manufacture the entire year's need of slow-moving products and dispatch it to the zonal stock points (ZSPs), which he was about to set up. That way the production set up and re-set up runs were minimised. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="20%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\230.GIF"> </TD>
<TD width="80%" colSpan=3>&nbsp;&nbsp; Rather than ship the entire production to the various depots, which usually resulted in uneconomic trucking loads, or large stock piles at every stocking point, Parthiv suggested the setting up of ZSPs which would carry each zones' needs of the slow-moving items. If such items were sent to the stockist, he would end up carrying more than his weekly requirement of the item and that was deemed cost ineffective. Therefore, such items were sent to the ZSPs and held in stock from where the dispatches could be made to the stockist based on his demand. So, ZSPs were set up and systems put in place. These would operate on a replenishment basis. <BR>&nbsp; The same system was put in place for faster-moving items like hygiene care. Whatever the stockist sold of these high-volume items each day was replenished the next day. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; As for the factories, one single objective was placed: 'everyday in the morning you will get a dispatch plan. You will merely dispatch and plan your next day's production plans.' The sales branches were assigned a volume target, but he also demanded accuracy of forecasts. <BR>&nbsp; And, thus, it went on for two years, to everyone's joy and profit. The plan was successfully executed, stocks were in sync and the old tussle between sales and production stopped. The factories got used to several changes to their production plan and, in fact, enjoyed the challenge.&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; Better still, working capital, which was 33% of turnover, came down to 3% and soon nil. In short, the new supply chain system was a work of art. &nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp; Then came January 2000, when Parthiv left to join the dot.com bandwagon. Kevin took over and the unexpected happened. After a month of patting the boys for winning the Y2K war, Kevin turned his sights on Plan Revamp. Soon after joining, he said to the commercial team: "This is too high a cost to pay. Additional space cost of the ZSPs, and the entire system management cost is prohibitive. I don't think anything has been achieved." <BR>&nbsp; "But look at the working capital savings!" said the commercial team. <BR>&nbsp; "That is manageable in a different manner," said Kevin. "Can the production logistics not be changed? Can't the truck loads be rationalised differently? Let the factory worry about what to produce and when to produce, let it do the logistics, the dispatch mixes. For example, if the factory at Pune is supplying jams to Nashik, then typically, the Nashik stockist's godown could be a conduit for dispatches to the stockists in Maharashtra. It should be the point at which load mixing takes place for other depots in western India. So why have ZSPs?" And he went on to detail a very complex but tenable argument for his case.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Likewise," he went on, "factories can produce the low-volume items in bulk, that's okay, but there is no need to stockpile these items at the ZSPs. Move it to the stockists directly and hold them there." In short his objective was: shift stock- keeping back to the factories or to the stockists. Move production planning back to the factory, which will decide what and how much, and accordingly, shipments will take place, it will not work backwards. Sales will not tell production what to produce. In essence, Kevin was reverting to 1997. Sizing the mood, he said: "Plan Revamp is pointless. Moving stocks from factory to zones is pointless. Stocks can be produced in bulk, but should be stocked at factories. In fact, if I have reduced working capital, stocks, I should also reduce space." Turning to Adip, he asked: "How did you agree to Plan Revamp? What have you saved? </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="75%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; What had changed was the comfort level that IT had brought into Mebrisk. It had changed the whole paradigm of running the business. "Then you discovered IT," said Kevin, "and put together a change. It may have reduced the chasm between sales and production plans, but your working capital savings are illusory. For all it had done was shift the stocks from the factories to the zones."<BR>&nbsp; Now in less than three years, they were moving three steps ahead. As Hemant now said to an agonised Adip: "Today, a factory and a depot are so well-connected, despite some being in remote places, that we don't need anyone either from Bangalore or Uttar Pradesh to speak to each other. The system will tell them what to do. </TD>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="25%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\231.GIF"> </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You don't need a manager in UP to monitor it, you don't need an officer in Ludhiana to chase trucks, you don't need the marketing cell to grope around watching slow-moving items. The factories and stockists today are well-connected and wired, they can handle it independent of head office sleuths!&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is we have never used IT at this level. Certainly, not in the sales and stocks system," ended Hemant.<BR>&nbsp; But for Adip, life was changing so fast that he was unable to even stop and evaluate his iterations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp; Hemant went on, "1997 was when e-commerce came to us from a foreign consultant. So we said, to internalise the value of e-commerce, we must do all this. But what we missed was that it is not the new system that is reaping results, but a new way of managing via e-commerce. We have just stepped on the learning curve from an era when we did not have the tools to put a viable system in place. <BR>&nbsp; "Creating a system which can capture sales, stocks, churn out data and information is possible for most organisations. But only when it is woven into a communication system that can network all the data points and move the data back and forth that we have intelligent, useful, actionable information everyday. As a result, we can create a more meaningful and result-oriented supply chain system as is being suggested by Kevin. Yet, who knows? Three years down the line, even this may appear inefficient! <BR>&nbsp; "Today, things have become so dependable, easy that you can revert to the factory-driven planning and production system. But that is viable only because you have a communication system which is so strong that you can make sure that factory and sales do what they are expected to do. Today, your information system and network is so intelligent that when a stockist sells something, the data simply goes and sits in the factory system. You don't need any of the old intermediaries to hound, watch and holler. Everything is online and immediate. So, we have the software, hardware and the communication networks to make it possible." </TD></TR>

<TD width="100%" colSpan=5><A target="_parent" class=punch>'The difference between kevin's amazement and your embarrassment is infotech. It's a difference of more than two years. Without it, managers at mebrisk would have moved on without the learning'. </A></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Adip was not consoled. "That makes me look like a joker!" he said. "Kevin's argument is fair, but how do I justify my 1997 decision? For me to explain to him the situation that was prevailing in 1996 was difficult. I told him we were producing one thing when we needed to sell other things. He was amazed. Here is Kevin, five years younger, 10 years smarter, speaks in bytes and chips, takes one look at my Plan Revamp and gasps! <BR>&nbsp; "He has come to Mebrisk when everything is available. He has come after the entire country has been wired. He finds it difficult to comprehend that as recently as the late 90s, fundamental stuff like daily sales, daily stocks, who is sending what and how much to whom etc., was not possible. That until 1997, we had seven managers chasing truck routes, looking for trucks that had left the factory four days ago and not reached the depots! Yet, there was always tremendous activity. But no optimality," said Hemant. <BR>&nbsp; "The difference between Kevin's surprise and your embarrassment is IT," said Hemant gently. "And it is a difference of just two and a half years. This change is terrific for organisations. Maybe Rs 17 crore went into it. But are we saying this was a waste? If it hadn't happened, would this whole revolution in IT have happened at Mebrisk? These are what I call step changes. You can't reach level three without traversing level one or two. If the 1997-2000 period had not happened, we wouldn't be at this stage of evolution today.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the 80s, when we hired a consultant to devise a system, we expected it to last 10 years at least. That was because the environment did not change a great deal, did not demand so much agility from companies, competition was not so sophisticated and intelligent.&nbsp; </TD></TR>

<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="20%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\232.GIF"> </TD>
<TD width="80%" colSpan=3>Today, smaller companies have the nerve to invest Rs 15 crore to wire up the whole country and every retail outlet, just to be able to know who sold how much.<BR>&nbsp; "Recall 1984 when the first batch of computers came in, what did we say? Rs 1.8 lakh per PC? No, no, too much money! Don't forget that too was an opportunity to move over to more sophisticated methods, which we bypassed. Yes, we had a 1406 mainframe, but it did not proffer the ability that we could have had with PCs. Again, that was an era when it was not even conceived that PCs could lend sophistication and agility. By the time we invested in PCs it was 1990. We lost five years of learning, because it was only in 1990 that we started experiencing a more agile and efficient operation in a number of areas. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; "So it is like this: the difference between having made this change three years ago and not having done it, is similar to what we lost by not embracing the PC culture in 1984. You must change with technology, that is how you learn to appreciate the change and decide in what direction you want to grow. I'll say the direction of your growth becomes a choice available when you are willing to enter the tide and be tossed around. Not by standing on the banks and waiting for the tide to change. <BR>&nbsp; Even today what are they telling me? 'Listen, wait, naya package aa raha hai, it will be Y2K compliant, it will be all comprehensive,... abhi ruk jao.' But you have to jump in at some stage, spend the money, learn, reiterate, spend more money, modify, revise... only then the learning takes place. Early man did not wait for James Watt to fire the steam engine so that distances could be covered. He used a crude version of an angular plane, the wheel, horses and I'd say that's what powered Watt to think steam. <BR>&nbsp; "Today, we are wiser. Having done it four years ago, we have realised what is possible. But if we hadn't done that, a generation of people would have moved on without the learning. And they would have reached a stage in their evolution when the change would not have impacted them. And as many people who participate in this start appreciating it, start thinking like James Watt and contribute to new thinking. <BR>&nbsp; "The environment is never going to be static. You have to start somewhere, either 1997 or 2000. Those who adopted the change in 1985 made wise changes in 1990, those who made the change in 1995 will make wiser changes in 2001 and those who didn't will battle those who have adopted change, then concede, then start learning in 2001 by which time others have covered bigger ground." <BR>&nbsp; Patting Adip on the back, Hemant said: "Don't fret. It's the price we pay for evolution. If this opportunity had not been participated in, it could have created serious lapses in our strategic thinking. Today if you can ask, 'why didn't I think about this?', it is because you energised your mind once to think differently. If you hadn't, you would not be perceiving the difference today." </TD></TR>

<TD width="80%" colSpan=3><I><B>Saurav Adhikari </B>is the president of HCL InfiNet, an ISP operating in the B2B &amp; B2C space.&nbsp;</I><BR>&nbsp;The ecommerce era arriveth. Poor Adip Arya. Little did he know that operation revamp would cause a turbulence that would reverberate across Mebrisk. Actually, there is little to fault Adip Arya for. Nor Hemant Trivedi. Nor Parthiv Vyas.<BR>&nbsp; In fact, I would fault Kevin Mathias for his roughshod ways in introducing his e-commerce initiative. In fact, had Mathias seriously dwelled on the historic basis for operation revamp, he would have found little conflict between Vyas's initiatives and what he was setting out to do. In fact, it is my contention that Vyas laid the basis on which Mathias could subsequently build on.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Let us quickly look at the issues in this case of operations revamp at Mebrisk:<BR>&nbsp; First is the critical issue of the production -- sales conflict and the wide variance in the sales forecast -- plans.<BR>&nbsp; Second is the issue of productivity measures at the factory level and, importantly, lack of inventory level measures at the sales end.<BR>&nbsp; Third is the issue of the Rs 17-crore investment in V-Sats and communication infrastructure to drive operation revamp.<BR>&nbsp; Fourth, the immediate benefits of a tight process re-engineering covering the entire supply chain.<BR>&nbsp; Fifth is the change of guard from Vyas to Mathias, coinciding with the e-com revolution.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; I will attempt to answer these issues not necessarily sequentially, but in support of my previous contention that Vyas laid the basis for the e-commerce initiatives to follow.&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; The e-commerce wave has rolled out at a relentless pace worldwide. Unlike physical assets and technology which require long lead times and absorption rates, IT can be more easily configured into a company's operating structure, subject of course to the willingness to change. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5><A target="_parent" class=punch>The paradigm shift that vyas engineered was significant. He shook up a lethargic system and made it an accurate forecasting base model&nbsp; </A></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Too much has been made of the mystique of e-commerce. In reality, e-commerce is nothing more than commerce transacted over the Net using all the capabilities that existing hardware, software and connectivity that comes with it, which enables business to be more responsive to the entire business cycle.<BR>&nbsp; Today, a business is no longer seen as individual elements comprising sales, marketing, production, logistics, finance, as part of the internal enterprise. Nor are suppliers, transporters, warehouses, distributors seen as distinctive elements of the external enterprise. The concept today is of an integrated extended enterprise where all elements, both upstream and downstream, are linked into one chain using a host of IT applications such as enterprise resource planning, supply chain management and customer relationship management (CRM). Even the consumer today gets linked into the extended enterprise with CRM, thanks to the power of the Net to seamlessly do all this. This phenomenon even in the mid-90s was not forecast by many enterprises. Witness the moves by many large corporates including General Motors and Ford, who are Web-enabling their business so as not to be washed away by the tide of e-commerce. Yesterday's decision for many of them seems irrelevant, if not antiquated, in the context of the Net economy.` </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="72%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; So what did Vyas do right ? First, he brought a sense of discipline into Mebrisk's planning cycle. A difference of 60% between sales forecast and actual sales is unacceptable and reflective of lax management. The fact that the production team could go ahead and produce irrespective of market needs just to meet man-hours-per-tonne criteria is patently absurd.<BR>&nbsp; Second, Vyas introduced productivity and incentive measures in tune with the requirements of business. Producing to plan and forecasting accuracy within plus-minus 3% was essential. Without this basic alignment between production and sales, two commonly antagonistic departments in every corporation, no progress could be made.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, vendors were put on to just-in-time as an integral basis for planning and working capital reduction. </TD>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="28%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\234.GIF"> </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourthly, he invested Rs 17 crore in V-Sat connections. This linkage allowed free and easy flow of data leading to high accuracy in the planning process. In fact, this laid the basis for the e-commerce data flows that Mathias was to inherit in Y2K.<BR>&nbsp; Finally, and most importantly, the paradigm shift that Vyas engineered at Mebrisk was his most significant contribution. He shook up a lethargic systems and made it work. And what did Vyas do wrong ?&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; The only accusation could be that he did not automate Web-enable the sales, logistics and production systems. But logically this had to happen over time and only after the business process had been reengineered.<BR>&nbsp; Today we take Virtual Private Networks and enterprise- wide software for granted. At the time Vyas was trying to introduce his changes, it may have been inappropriate to introduce these without a sense of discipline. Despite wide availability of software, forecasting still remains the domain of sales managers, as subtle changes in market trends and demands cannot be forecast with accuracy without the correct inputs by software. As we know, good input leads to good output.<BR>&nbsp; What Mathias shook Adip Arya with was a historical progression from the era of system-driven to software and e-commerce-driven enterprises. If only all of us have the ability to forecast the future with great accuracy we could all be visionaries.<BR>&nbsp; Vyas, in my opinion, laid the basis for the e-commerce initiatives that Mathias found so easy to initiate in a more disciplined Mebrisk. Bravo Vyas! Good luck, Mathias! And Adip, you don't need to fret. Enjoy the e-commerce era. </TD></TR>

<TD width="80%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; <B>V.V.S. Mani</B> <I>is asssociate vice-president (management consulting) at Siemens Information Systems.<BR><BR>&nbsp;</I> In a large number of organisations, when decisions pertaining to information technnology taken a few years back are reviewed in today's context, many appear to be wrong or inadequately appraised. This is largely due to significant growth and changes in technology, combined with substantial reduction in prices of IT products, brought about by intense competition in the market place.&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;Perhaps, what is required is a shift in the traditional way of appraising investments in IT<BR>&nbsp; The "engineering" mentality of appraising projects has to give way to one that evaluates, inter alia, non-quantifiable benefits that accrue from investments in information technology. Decision makers in most organisations are neither sensitive enough to understand IT -- its capabilities and limitations --- nor are the IT personnel savvy enough to comprehend business requirements and their nuances.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mebrisk has not been an exception. Three years ago, while reeling under competitive forces in the market, it felt the need to improve its operational efficiencies. The supply chain, the backbone of Mebrisk was handicapped by an inefficient forecasting system (which was the basis for production, procurement and stocking decisions), delayed availability of data on products and stocks, a misaligned performance measurement system for the factory (the measures had no relevance to satisfying customer needs).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; Surely, considerable amount of time and effort would have been spent on resolving inter-functional conflicts. The results were there for anyone to see: significant forecasting error, mismatch between market requirements and inventories and an inflexible attitude at the factory. What was required for Mebrisk was a system that provided information on all the relevant supply chain parameters, perhaps, on a real-time basis, which would provide:&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; A common database for all functions / departments to aid decision-making and resolve inter-functional disputes.&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; A flexible manufacturing set-up that reacted fast to the market and is not constrained by manufacturing efficiencies.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; A shortened planning horizon which would reduce the ill-effects of forecasting errors, and allow managers to concentrate on value-adding activities rather than 'chasing' data.</TD></TR>

<TD width="100%" colSpan=5><A target="_parent" class=punch>The experience of integrating infotech into the main business, is the most valuable benefit that has been gained from earlier investments </A></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Parthiv Vyas, the man who took over the operation and finance function in 1997, recognised the needs of the company correctly. As a pre-requisite all the depots, factories, regions and the head-office were networked. Vyas changed the method of planning, realigned the factory performance measures to be market-oriented, created buffer stock points to take care of product-mix variations. His decisions were proved right by the fact that stocks were in sync and the working capital reduced from 33% of turnover to 3%, which is very significant, and the production function became flexible enough to meet market requirements.<BR>&nbsp; The decision about creating separate zonal stock points may be questionable but the project was definitely a success. The investment in IT for this project was quite significant (Rs 17 crore). But then, the benefits justify it. Looking back after three years, the investment in the project appears to be high. The price of enterprise resource planning, for example, are about 50% of what prevailed four years back. Should this mean that organisations need to wait for three years to take any IT initiative?&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="72%" colSpan=3>&nbsp;Three years for an organisation in a rapidly changing market environment is a long period. The benefits that have accrued in terms of improved supplies to market and reduced inventories have justified the investment in IT. While these are quantifiable benefits, it is important to understand and appreciate that Mebrisk as a company has built the capability to become market-oriented (and not manufacturing-dictated), to use new technology and weave IT into the main fabric of its business.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now Mebrisk is capable of further forays into the use of IT. It is the experience of introducing, familiarising and integrating IT into the main business, which is the most valuable benefit that has been gained from earlier investments. IT has not been left as a standalone cell engaged in processing data.&nbsp; </TD>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="28%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\236.GIF"> </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; The next initiative will be to look at e-commerce based on Net technologies which offer a exciting cost-efficient supply chain models where trading on the Internet is child'splay with benefits of speed and almost zero cost of transactions (barring physical movement of goods). Unlike most firms, Mebrisk has the experience in dealing with organisation-wide changes, and e-commerce is one of them.&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; E-business helps organisations to operate at a never-imaginable rate of agility. A critical question: when should a company go in for e-business? Option one: market is highly dynamic and hence, the responsiveness of an organisation requires e-speed. Option two: The market is not that dynamic but company e-enables the processes to set new rules in the market and gives customers more than what they expected. Either of the alternatives requires a high level of change management, more so the second option. With experience behind them, Mebrisk has developed the capability to manage quantum changes. Hence, it can leap into the future with a high level of optimism.<BR>&nbsp; Could Mebrisk have adopted e-commerce initiatives had they not gone through the first phase of change? Difficult to answer with certainty, but based on the experience of large and mature (old) organisations, one can boldly say the risks of failure would have been far higher and hence, the costs too. The leadership organisations are those that set the trend, albeit at a higher initial cost, but that is a small price to pay for long-term success. </TD></TR>

<TD width="90%" colSpan=4><A target="_parent" class=punch>The Signboard Advertising The New Pasta From Chef's Choice Must Be Placed In The Right Place To Attract Shoppers, So, Where Exactly Would That Be?</A></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="90%" colSpan=4>&nbsp; Pramod Ahuja stood long at the entrance of Shop Point supermarket and scanned the store, looking at all the signboards around. Fifteen days ago, he had commissioned a signboard for Chef's Choice's new pasta, Dente -- a tubelit colourful four by three -- which he had asked to be positioned strategically at Shop Point. But the signboard was nowhere in sight. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Pramod, the sales director of Chef's Choice, then sought the attention of the store manager, who led him to a spot next to the alley that stocked rice, wheat flour, lentils, spices and sugar. He was numbed. There stood his signboard, lost in a corner, where the lighting was not exactly beckoning attention. Worse, right in front of it lay two huge stacks of wheat flour. All that could be seen even from up close was the top two feet of the signboard -- certainly not the message line. Annoyed, he asked for the flour bags to be removed. Meanwhile, he called Anuj Patki, his assistant sales manager and asked him to reach the store immediately. <BR>&nbsp; The space now cleared, Pramod viewed his stunning signboard with pleasure. He adjusted the stand, cocked his head on one side, viewed it again, walked back 10 steps, surveyed the board, turned left and surveyed the supermarket area that led to the signboard. <BR>&nbsp; Yes, that was where the shoppers came in from. But no! The signboard faced the alley at an angle, which meant the shoppers entering the store would not see it, or even if they did, they would have to turn around to study it. <BR>&nbsp; Pramod walked away and stood near the cosmetics counter which ran perpendicular to the grains alley... and watched. Shoppers walked straight into the alley without even glancing at the signboard. Pramod went up and turned the board around, so that it now faced the entering shoppers. <BR>&nbsp; Next, he decided to go into the alley to see if the signboard impacted the shoppers. He ambled down, trying to appear like any shopper, glancing at the shelves, eyes darting now and then to study the shoppers... until he reached the very end of the shopping alley. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="75%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; Dente was not among the wares. For that matter neither were Maggie, Top Ramen, Bambino or Spiro. <BR>&nbsp; Pramod was looking around for the store manager when Anuj strode in. "This is absurd!" said Pramod in a half-whisper. "That signboard has been stuck in an obscure corner and you didn't even think of the clutter. Have you been monitoring it? And where is Dente? It's not even on the shelves!" <BR>&nbsp; Anuj was confused. He had personally placed 30 packs of Dente only two days ago. That's when he realised Pramod's mistake. "You're looking for it in the wrong alley.&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; Pasta is over there, with all the ready-to-cook foods," he said as he began to lead Pramod two alleys away. &nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp; Pramod was annoyed. "Then why is the signboard here?" asked Pramod. "Shouldn't it be where the shopper finds pasta?" </TD>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="25%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\238.GIF"> </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;&nbsp; "But there is no place there -- no wall space," said Anuj. <BR>&nbsp; "Find a solution!" said Pramod in a low growl. "The idea behind having that signboard announcing a new product is to convert the message into interest and interest into purchase. And that means placing the product within two minutes of the product announcement. For that is how long a message remains fresh in a shopper's mind. His mind says Dente, Dente, Dente, and bang! he sees Dente and picks it up." <BR>&nbsp; "Let's take a look at the pasta alley," he said to Anuj. As they walked past the two alleys, Pramod noticed some stickers on the dividing walls: Soon arriving, Chef's Choice range of healthy soups -- Cup-a-day'. <BR>&nbsp; Pramod winced. Cup-a-day was launched eight months ago, but the stickers remained. What was worse, it was likely to confuse and even deter prospective shoppers of Cup-a-day, he thought. Turning to Anuj, he said: "This is real absurd. Don't we have a system that also pulls off old point-of-purchase material (POP)?" <BR>&nbsp; By now, both men were facing the pasta shelves. The top two shelves were piled high with Maggie on one side and Burly's on the other. The third shelf was an assortment of Top Ramen, Bambino and a few packs of Dente, while the fourth shelf was entirely Dente. Pramod watched the shoppers pick up multiple packs of Maggie. That was natural, he thought to himself. Just then a lady came up, accompanied by her teenage daughter. "Let's buy Top Ramen," urged the girl. "Remember the ad? Shahrukh was too good!" The mother picked up four packets of Top Ramen noodles. <BR>&nbsp; Pramod nudged Anuj. "Go on!" he said. Anuj walked up to the lady and asked: "You just chose Top Ramen. Not Maggie?"<BR>&nbsp; "We always buy Maggie. When these kids are studying for an exam they are perpetually hungry. Maggie is easy that way," she said. Smiling, she said: "My daughter likes the new Shahrukh ad so much, she wants to buy Top Ramen." <BR>&nbsp; "Since you eat so much pasta, you must have tried Dente?" asked Anuj. The lady looked thoughtful. "No..." said the lady. "Never heard of it." <BR>&nbsp; "Oh, I just saw a signboard for Dente, fortified with vitamins and all that," said Anuj casually. "What signboard?" asked the lady. No, she hadn't seen the signboard. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD vAlign=center align=middle width="20%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\239.GIF"> </TD>
<TD width="80%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; "That's what I mean," said Pramod later. "She remembers Shahrukh so she buys Top Ramen, but had she seen the Dente signboard she may have reached for the Dente packs and read it. Even bought it. Shoppers are strange animals. There is no saying why they buy. Supermarkets are a marketer's delight. It's a sure-fire vehicle for impulse purchase." &nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp; Anuj wouldn't agree entirely. "See, many are walking around with lists. They know what they want," he said. "Therefore, if a shopper has come to buy Flora cooking oil, she will buy just that, not Saffola."<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sure," agreed Pramod, "There are some products, typically cooking medium or toothpaste where brand loyalty is high and rarely does a shopper switch over. But in casual food or snack food items, you will find a high level of adventure. So, there is a list and much of the list is bought. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;But examine their cart and you will find at least 40% of the contents don't feature on their list. They buy what they see -- a product or some message that has just been introduced into their database which keeps ticking till they encounter the product. Want to test it? Okay, this lady is stopping at the soaps section, go, ask her 20 questions." <BR>&nbsp; The lady picked up two each of Rexona and Imperial Leather. "So you are a Rexona family?" said Anuj. "Nothing like that," said the lady, a trifle self-conscious. "I just picked it up." <BR>&nbsp; "What brand did you come to buy?" asked Anuj. "I change my brand once in a while," replied the woman.<BR>&nbsp; "Okay, let me ask you that differently," said Anuj in a friendly manner. "What brand were you looking for? Why Rexona and not, say, Liril?" <BR>&nbsp; "Oh, there is this offer on Rexona. Buy two, get one free..." said the lady with a grin. <BR>&nbsp; "That's nice," said Anuj. "But you must have a family brand..." The lady laughed. "Not really, just Cinthol. Over the years our bathroom has smelt of Cinthol, somehow one gets used to things like that. But we also use Lifebuoy Gold, Lux..."Pramod smiled at Anuj. Walking back towards the pasta shelves, he said: "See? She saw all the soaps, surveyed, decided on Rexona. It's not even her brand.<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; So, you see how the psychology of buying works? It's fascinating Anuj -- there is a lot to learn by just watching these shoppers. This place is like a virtual TV screen. Try and hear what is going on in their mind. Watch their eye movements. At what point in their browsing are they pausing, getting distracted? Isn't that the point where your POP and signboard should come in? So, where can we place the signboard so that it is noticed? Now, standing here, can you see the signboard?" he asked. <BR>&nbsp; "How can you, Pramod?" asked Anuj. "It is two alleys away." "Precisely!" replied Pramod. "This is the foods alley, the place where new food products signages must appear regularly. But our Rs 1.5-lakh signboard for Dente pasta is sitting next to Annapurna Atta! What's the point? Or it should be the first enormous thing you see when you enter the store!"<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Anuj examined the signboard area. Shoppers came in from the west end of the store, picked up their trolleys from the right side alcove and rode into the first alley, the nearest one -- cereals, milk food, cooking oils, ghee... Zigzagging through seven alleys, they emerged at the exit of the eighth alley where the bulkier items like rice, wheat flour, lentils and sugar were stocked. It was the point where Dente's signboard stood, bold and bright, but right in the way of the overloaded carts and exhausted shoppers.&nbsp;&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="75%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; "Well, they see it as they are leaving," said Anuj. "That's pointless, isn't it?" said Pramod. "Why do I want a Rs 1.5-lakh signboard at a place where shoppers are not going to be impacted? At a point in their buying process when it does not matter anymore? If they are going to see it while leaving, if you can't get their attention as they are entering, you may as well make a bonfire of the signboard. More likely they will see it then!"<BR>&nbsp; "Please understand supermarkets are designed for impulse purchases, for spot decisions," he went on. "It is not a place where you collect information, store it and say, 'Okay, next time I will buy Bristo's pet food.' The decision to buy happens on the shop floor, on the spot... tadaak, like that! You see, you decide, you buy."&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; Pramod was by now unhappy at the way the whole store was laid out. "Did you notice where Dente was placed?" he asked Anuj.&nbsp; </TD>
<TD width="25%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\240.GIF"> </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;"Fourth shelf..." said Anuj, ready for more outbursts from Pramod.<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; "And didn't I say it must be right at the top? At eye level?" asked Pramod. "It must be the first pasta you see as you hit the section. No-no-no-no-no! This is a waste of all our efforts. Fourth shelf! You know when you see the fourth shelf? When you haven't been able to make a decision on shelves one, two and three. When a shopper has made her decision on shelf one and left, your brand sitting on shelf four has just died. And it will rest there in peace till our bankers retrieve it to recover our loans! And where were our POP danglers?" <BR>&nbsp; "At the head of the alley," said Anuj, hopelessly. <BR>&nbsp; "What's the point?" asked Pramod. "If you have the POP at the start of the alley, why didn't you place the product right there? The point where you inform must be the point of display and sale. That's the role of merchandising. You can't have product information at one point and display at another. Shoppers don't cause such connectivity. The buying decision is more random than linear in a supermarket." <BR>&nbsp; Pramod and Anuj, talking in low voices, had by now reached the head of the first alley. "Hey, that's Maya. Let's see if she saw the signboard," said Pramod. <BR>&nbsp; Maya was the legal head of Chef's Choice and she was standing at the head of the first alley, browsing among the cereals. "Hi!" said Pramod, startling Maya. "Let me watch you buy," he teased. <BR>&nbsp; Maya laughed. "In that case, I must disappoint you," she said. "I came for cooking oil and I have finished the buying act. Sorry Mr Sales Surgeon, you must look for other prey," she said, dropping a packet of wheat germ into her basket. <BR>&nbsp; Pramod retrieved the packet of wheat germ from her basket and read: "Bagry's wheat germ -- big health trip! Good stuff?" <BR>&nbsp;"I have no clue," she said. "I'm buying it for the first time." <BR>&nbsp; Pramod and Anuj laughed. "Do you women ever buy the same brand a second time?" asked Pramod. We just met another lady who was buying a soap she had not used in 30 years. Say, why are you buying wheat germ if you don't know anything about it?" <BR>&nbsp; "Time-pass," said Maya. Then after a pause, she said: "Actually, I am waiting for my husband. He is at the ATM downstairs." <BR>&nbsp; Pramod was intrigued. "Now this is interesting, tell me, what cereal do you usually eat?" <BR>&nbsp; "I don't eat cereal, Pramod. I am a diehard alu parantha fan," said Maya. <BR>&nbsp; "No? Then why wheat germ?" he asked. <BR>&nbsp; "Look, I wasn't looking for wheat germ, I wasn't looking for anything save my cooking oil. I told you I was waiting for my husband," said Maya. <BR>&nbsp; Pramod noticed the cereal shelves were close to the main entrance to the store. "This is fascinating!" he exclaimed. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="20%" colSpan=2><IMG SRC="my project_images\241.GIF"> </TD>
<TD width="80%" colSpan=3>&nbsp;"Shut up, Pramod," said Maya. "I go and buy wheat germ and you react like I wrote The God Of Small Things." <BR>&nbsp; "Maya, you won't understand," said Pramod, even as Anuj laughed. "Look, you came to buy cooking oil, you don't eat cereal, yet you have bought wheat germ." <BR>&nbsp; Maya looked incredulous. "Is this what they pay you for?,'' she asked. Anuj laughed and said: See, this point is strategic to Maya. From here she can see when her husband returns. It's incidental this shelf has cereal. If it were shaving creams, she would have bought shaving creams." <BR>&nbsp; "Don't be absurd," said Maya laughing. "See that?" she said, pointing to a hand-drawn poster above the cereal shelf. It was an A4 size sheet with a handwritten message -- Get your fibre, get rid of cholesterol'. <BR>&nbsp; </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;&nbsp; "That proves my point conclusively," said Pramod. "A forceful message at the point of purchase enables purchase..." <BR>&nbsp; "Pramod," said Maya, "I am not one of your archetypal shoppers who is armed with lists, has brand preferences, makes decisions and cost benefit analyses... I told you I came for cooking oil..." <BR>&nbsp; "But nevertheless, you bought wheat germ Maya," said Pramod. Then surprised at himself, he said: "No, you won't understand. You are arguing this legally'. Anuj, pay attention to what is going on. Shoppers can't be put into slots. They do crazy things, like Maya and that Rexona lady, that's my point. You have to punctuate their shopping craze with deft, well-placed, well-timed messages, and capitalise on their unpredictable behaviour. The supermarket is a virtual TV screen. In fact, better than that, it is a live commercial, even better, for it has a ninth dimension, feelings. And mind you it isn't even the usage situation, like in a TV commercial. That Rexona lady wasn't bathing. She was imagining a bath, her granny, her childhood, and in a moment she has bought a soap she has not used in 30 years!" <BR>&nbsp; Maya was by now staring at the two men with a look of extreme concern. "Is this how you spend your Sundays?" she asked. "This boy should be out on a date, not studying women who use Rexona." But Pramod went on: "Ditto in the case of Maya. She does not eat cereal, yet she has been made to think of fibre, cholesterol.. and she is soon saying to herself, 'why not?' And she buys wheat germ. That little poster, that message was the enabler. Now, think about Dente. What value did we get putting that signboard in a corner, at an exit point?" he asked. <BR>&nbsp; "Okay, it was the only available space," he went on, "but is it leading to purchase? Is it enabling purchase? And who is noticing it? The shopper heading for the cash counter. And what value is that at that point? Zero!" <BR>&nbsp; Anuj was making a lot of connections in his mind. He was beginning to see Pramod's drift. "But you need to ask," Pramod was saying, "where in this whole 6,000 square feet store can I get the biggest bang for my buck? Where will this signboard make sense?" <BR>&nbsp; "You know, we need to look for gaps in people's lives and put messages there," Pramod continued. "Like the elevator, where 20 people stand staring at the ceiling. Now, I would like to put a message for deodorants or oral care there . Like If you brush your teeth after every meal, that is at least 50 visits to the dentist saved, or Rs 20,000. Try Colgate.' These are great situations for selling a product usage habit which is otherwise difficult to imbue in people. Even an office toilet is a great opportunity for say, Reckitts to say -- Remember to pull the flush, the Harpic ball in this flush tank will ensure a bacteria-free toilet before your next visit.' '' <BR>&nbsp; Maya despaired. "Bye guys," she said, spotting her husband. But Pramod was possessed. "Look at that cafeteria there," he said, pointing to the store's fast-food counter. "There are six people waiting to pick up their colas. Just watch, three whole minutes of staring, while that man fills one glass at a time, then goes looking for straws... That's where you need a dangler which says, 'Our floors are swept with Domex so that you have a bacteria-free environment as you shop and eat... Imagine the value of a sign like that in a place like McDonald's. How many people will read it!" <BR>&nbsp; Anuj looked around. There were at least 150 shoppers walking around, lingering, hastening, browsing, choosing, rejecting, turning back, changing decisions... How was he to catch their attention? Or even know what grabbed their attention? </TD></TR>

<TD width="80%" colSpan=3><B>Suresh Narayanan </B><I>is executive vice-president at Nestle' India.<BR></I><BR>&nbsp; A well-known phrase in the trade sums it up: what is seen is what will sell! Pramod and Anuj are confronted with a serious, albeit controversial, question of sales and marketing at FMCG (fast-moving consumer goods) companies: What does it take to grab a shoppers' attention, and how do you implement and measure the impact of merchandising and display? </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Numerous theoretical constructs offer relationships between the power of branding, providing stimuli for reminders and translating it into the marketer's bonanza -- purchase. Pramod and Anuj are indulging in similar gymnastics of logic, observation and processes in consumer behaviour to ensure that the Dente signboard does the Superman' act of herding shoppers to grab the brand, set the cash registers ringing and make big brands bite the dust. If the process of consumer choice was so simple as well-placed signage, we would be literally eating, sleeping and drinking colas! Obviously, there is more to strong brands than resplendent signages. A look at the issues: <BR>&nbsp; The Power Of Branding: If your target is the educated, urban consumer in the supermarket ambience nothing can substitute for the trigger of a strong brand. You can remind shoppers of your presence, put up the POP (point-of-purchase) and debate the size, aesthetics and position of the signage -- none of this helps if the brand is a dodo.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Shelf Presence: Assuming Dente gets its branding right to combat its competitors, Pramod is dead right on his shelf observation. There is science and art in putting your brand on the shelf and keeping it in large quantities, neatly stacked at eye-level. It reinforces the trigger to purchase. Ensuring constant stock pressure, clean stocks and branding upfront get you a plus. I recall the drill when I began my career at Levers: wipe clean every Dalda tin on the shelf because a dirty tin is lost sale! </TD></TR>

<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;&nbsp; Role Of POP: Designing outstanding POP material is the art of blending relevant aesthetics into the corpus of singular brand focus and reinforcing the "reason to buy". One often finds, in many companies, that the sales and marketing teams ignore the need for simplicity to create material neither fish nor fowl, pandering to the ego of its creator but of little interest to the consumer. Maya has endorsed, in terms of her purchase of wheat germ, the tacit principle of good POP -- get more of the fibre of branding and get rid of the cholesterol of irrelevant aesthetics!<BR>&nbsp; Triggers To Impulse: With a multiplicity of brands, yesterday's market leaders getting toppled and the reality of large stock-keeping unit inventories, I wonder whether Pramod and Anuj are right in rationalising purchase behaviour in terms of "steady state" brands and "impulse" brands. Notwithstanding the merits of the logic that the Rexona lady has defied, it remains a truism of shelf management that "eye-level" or "hand-level" (if kids are involved) displays, and breaking shopping monotony with "impulse" brand counters with attractive consumer offers does help. Any FMCG marketer of reasonable standing in the impulse category at supermarkets has designed such triggers and benefited from this. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="70%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; &nbsp; Measuring Merchandising Impact: The Achilles' heel of most evaluations of marketing is the impact the merchandising effort has had on sales or market share. Amidst acrimonious debates on whether branding or shelf presence with in-store merchandising yields higher sales, it remains important to strike a "balance" in resource allocation (if at all we have one!). I suspect that in the current environment, a lot of what Pramod and Anuj would say about merchandising impact on sales would be anecdotal. However, "measurement" of merchandising with reasonably robust parameters and giving a syndicated feedback to marketers could be the next bonanza for market research agencies once the Y2K business thins away! </TD>

<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; In-Store Buying Behaviour: While the imagery of a "virtual TV screen" is evocative and worthy of kudos at a presentation, a lot of Pramod and Anuj's rationale is pure logic punctuated with glimmers of psychological insight. Understanding the jigsaw of branding, merchandising, promotions and determinants of buying behaviour for various product categories is a huge area of learning for marketers. Maybe Pramod should commission a quick study on what will get Dente off the blocks in the supermarket. It is too simplistic to pull up Anuj on the placement of a signboard at the store as the cause-effect for Dente's performance, even if Rs 1.50 lakh is at stake. <BR>&nbsp; Innovation In Merchandising: With the race for share of stomach, share of throat and share of virtually every element of the human and his environs, we have added share of shelf and share of air space. More and more ambiences are becoming receptacles of a brand slogan -- the issue again is the relevance of ambience to the promise of the brand. <BR>&nbsp; Innovation and using new materials and media are the lifeblood of merchandising. The only point is to draw the line between any "opportunity to see" and relevant "opportunity see": So, Colgate may like consumers to look up to its brand (in an elevator), I am not sure if Harpic would enjoy being flushed out! </TD></TR>

<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;In Turkey, for instance, in less than a decade, an estimated 80% of a similar market was converted to supermarkets. In India, it is likely to be lower and take longer, but there is no doubt that the day of the supermarket is here. As always, the advantage will go to the first movers who understand this. <BR>&nbsp; Supermarkets are a paradise for brand marketers. Indeed, in this environment, even many non-impulse products benefit from impulse rub-off', as Maya clearly demonstrates. It is the one arena where even a small budget brand can take on the biggies of TV, if it is innovative and savvy enough with its PoS (point-of-sales) materials. Research in Germany has shown that upto 80% of purchase decision is influenced at the PoS. In-store communication must be crisp, captivating and, if somehow possible, interactive. It is even more essential that it be placed strategically. A customer's mind needs to be engaged by the brand immediately, while it is fresh. Yet the communication must not be far from the product itself, as brand memory does not travel well.&nbsp; </TD></TR>

<TR>
<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp; Similarly, a special offering, positioned a little before the shopper reaches the category shelf itself, could easily pre-empt competition. PoS material itself must be innovative and engaging, to differentiate itself from the clutter. In the USA, for instance, Gold Seal Indus Valley basmati rice used a talking shelf strip, with an audio recording greeting shoppers, immediately attracting their attention. Even at the otherwise dead end of the shopping experience, the check-out counter, there are possibilities. At Nanz, in New Delhi, many shoppers actually went back and purchased a Nivea product, after putting their purchases into the plastic carrier bags provided, being reminded by the bold Nivea branding on them. Shelving at the correct height can mean life or death for a brand, especially a new or weak one -- people rarely stretch beyond comfortable arms reach. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width="70%" colSpan=3>&nbsp; Among all the sophisticated techniques, the single most important one is simply common sense. One needs to see the shop floor through the eyes of the shopper, and understand that it is a hectic battle with hundreds of other brand messages, vying for a share of the customer's mind, with no intermediary. Capture her attention and interest, and her purse will not be far away. However, it is remarkable how few field personnel, such as Anuj, take the time or trouble to appreciate this simple truth. The most critical development in today's market is the change of the focus of the sales pitch' from the shopkeeper to the customer herself. This is a whole new ball game, with its own rules. Only those who quickly understand this paradigm shift will triumph in the new era. </TD>

<TD width="100%" colSpan=5>&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a lonely furrow that Pramod has to plough, and his biggest challenge will be to educate, and motivate his own sales force in the ways of the new millennium. The winners will be those able to bring to the battle for this new marketplace, the thrill and passion of a football match, coupled with the logical, analytic mind of a scientist. The winning sales director will be the coach who can create, inspire and sustain such a team. More power to you, Pramod ! </TD></TR>
