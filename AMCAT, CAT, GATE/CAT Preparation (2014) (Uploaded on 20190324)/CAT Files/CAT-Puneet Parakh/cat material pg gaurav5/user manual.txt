Folks I know this is pretty late, as CAT is round the corner , but you will find these extremely useful anyway.

  Here are two  simple applications ADD.EXE & SUB.EXE written in C++. These applications can be used to  practice the  the operations of mental addition & subtraction, thus saving the valuable time on the D-day. Thus as you can practice to mentally perform these calculations, it also tells you the average time per question taken by you , thus you can also improve your speed .

How to use:
____________________________________________
Here as U invoke  any of the program, you are first asked to enter the limit. Limit is nothing more than the level of Qs you want to practice . A limit of 2 means the numbers  will be under 100 , limit of 3 means numbers will be under 1000, & so on.

If the answer given by you is wrong, it on the spot gives you the correct answer.Press any key for next question. Also, time lapsed in displaying the correct answer & then in pressing the key is not considered. Remember that only that time is  taken into account till the moment  you hit the ENTER key, for entering your answer.

Whenever U want to stop calculating & see your results , all you have to do is enter a negative answer(any negative number, like -6) to that question asked. Press any key  n the results are displayed; then press any key to terminate the program. ( Keep in mind that answer & time taken for the last question, to which you entered the negative answer , will not be taken into consideration for evaluating the results i.e. that question will be simply ignored.) For any more query mail me at my id.
The result is displayed in this format:
___________________________________________
Total Qs: XXX
Correct : XXX
Wrong  : XXX

Total time taken: XX sec
Time/Question   : XX sec

 I have also got a same application for mental multiplication(MULTIPLY.EXE) with a color interface . All of us (specially all the IMS students) already know the shortcut method to multiply two numbers under 100. Now this program gives you chance to practice whole method mentally , and improve your speed, as we all know that multiplicatuion is the most time consuming of all. But it is feasable only after you have mastered a good speed in mental addition, coz the trick involves addition.
