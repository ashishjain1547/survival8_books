    <u>Passage &#150;1</u><br>
    <br>
    Ian Fleming&#146;s evil globe-fish &#150; also known as puffer, blowfish,
    swellfish, or in Japanese, fugu &#150; is one of the most mysterious creatures 
    of the sea. It is perhaps the world&#146;s most deadly fish, yet in Japan 
    the honorable fugu is the epitome of gourmet dining.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">About 100 species of puffers in several closely
  related families can be found throughout the world. Their most obvious characteristic is
  their ability to balloon out from a reasonable fish shape into a sphere two or three times
  large. When frightened, excited, or annoyed, they gulp water, or even air, into a sac on
  the belly. It swells inside their tough, elastic skin, like an inner tube inside a tire,
  so as to discourage predators or intimidate rivals. When the fish feels safe, it squirts
  out the water or releases the air, deflating to its normal shape.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In japan, eating fugu has been the gastronomic
  version of Russian roulette for centuries. Sometimes a diner stills losses the gamble. His
  chopsticks clatter to the table from nerveless fingers; he pales; his breathing
  labours.
  It is often the subject of traditional senryu verse. Last night he and I ate
  fugu;<br>
  Today, I help carry his coffin<br>
  &quot;It&#146;s a terrible death,&quot; a Japanese restaurant owner told me. &quot;Even
  though you can think very clearly, your arms and legs become numb. It becomes impossible
  to sit up. You can think but cannot speak, cannot move, and soon cannot breathe.&quot;</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Why the Japanese, who venerate hygiene, should
  make a ritual of eating deadly poisonous fish, is difficult for foreigners to comprehend.
  fugu ovaries, intestine, and liver can be so deadly that if even a tiny touch of them is
  left in the flesh, the gourmet dies, often within minutes. About 60 percent of puffer
  poisonings prove fatal.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">When eating fugu, the diner puts his life in the
  hands of the chef. Before practicing their risky art, all fugu cooks must be licensed and
  must take intensive courses, extensive apprenticeship, and written exams.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">To eat fugu liver is the height of exotica. It is
  one of the most poisonous parts of the fish, and techniques for detoxifying it are not
  dependable. Chefs are prohibited from serving fugu liver, but they sometimes relent under
  the impassioned pleas of gourmets. Mitsugoro Bando had four servings and paid the ultimate
  price.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Despite the danger, demand for puffers is
  increasing so fast that the Japanese fishing grounds are being depleted. Today the
  Japanese are successfully culturing the fish.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Every year from October through March, millions
  of diners bet their lives on not getting fatally poisoned. Thanks to strict regulation of
  restaurants and wholesalers, the number that loses decreases each year. But this droll and
  perposterous fish with the goggling eyes, swollen belly, and floppy fins remains the
  world&#146;s most deadly feast. The enigma of the fugu is summed up in the traditional
  verse:<br>
  Those who eat fugu soap are stupid</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But whose who don&#146;t eat fugu soup are also
  stupid.&nbsp;</font></p>

  <br>
  A majority of scientists now agree that the &quot;ozone hole&quot; developed over the
  Antarctica due to the greatly increased use of Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). Though they
  were regarded as chemically inert materials, under conditions in the atmosphere with
  intense solar radiation CFCs have reacted with ozone. As the chlorine oxide amounts
  increased,, the ozone amount in the stratosphere (which protect the earth from the
  sun&#146;s ultraviolet radiation) fell. A wide range of effects through &quot;ozone
  hole&quot; was expected: skin cancers, damage to crops and animals and changes in the
  worlds weather patterns. Some international agreements including the Earth Summit (1992)
  contain provisions to reduce the release of CFSs and other harmful chemicals drastically
  by 2000 AD. The limit set by the European Union include complete phasing out by 1994 of
  Halons, the range of compounds containing Bromine used in fire extinguishers, as these are
  considered very harmful to atmospheric ozone. The heightened awareness in recent years
  keep earth&#146;s environment free of pollutants has produced one salutary effect in the
  form of two innovations: (1) the first CFC-free refrigerator made by a German firm DKK in
  1992, using propane and butane as the coolant and pentane for the insulating foam (2)New
  engine fitted to jet aircraft to generate less oxides of nitrogen (NOX) which are damaging
  to ozone.</font></p>

<p align="left"><u><strong><font face="Verdana" size="2">Explanatory answers to
paper III</font></strong></u></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">1. Para 1 states that eating puffer
fish is a gamble where sometimes the diner may lose his life. Hence, the answer
is [2].<br>
<br>
2. Not being able to speak, move and breathe are symptoms of fugu poisoning. Not
being able to think is not a symptom of fugu poisoning because para 1 states
that one can think but cannot speak, etc. Hence, the answer is [2].</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">3. Ovaries, intestines, and liver
are stated as being the most poisonous parts of a fugu. Hence, by a simple
process of elimination, option [3] is the logical choice.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">4. It is stated in para 4 that about
60 per cent who eat the puffer are poisoned to death. Therefore the rate of
people who survive puffer poisoning is 40%. Hence, the answer is [4].</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">5. The last para states that
millions of diners gamble their lives by eating puffer fish from October to
March. In the Northern Hemisphere, where Japan is situated, it is winter during
this period. Hence, the answer is [4].<br>
<br>
6. What the traditional verse actually implies is that the choice between eating
or not eating fugu is like choosing between the devil and the deep sea. You lose
out on the gourmet experience if you don’t eat it and if you eat it you may
lose out on your life. None of the 3 statements explain the correct meaning of
the quotation. Hence, the answer is [4].<br>
<br>
7. Refer to line 10 of the passage. Hence the answer is [2].<br>
<br>
8. Except for citric acid which is an absolutely harmless acid and not mentioned
in the passage at&nbsp; all, the harmful effects of all the other chemicals are
laid out clearly in the passage. Hence, the&nbsp; answer is [4].<br>
<br>
9. The very first sentence of the passage states that the ‘ozone hole’ over
the continent of Antarctica was caused due to the increase in the use of
chlorofluorocarbon in the atmosphere. Hence, the answer is [1].<br>
<br>
10. The author enumerates the harmful effects of the ozone layer as cusing skin
cancers in human being and damage to crops and animals. Its destructive effect
on climactic conditions is not mentioned to all, for changes in weather
conditions do not automatically imply storms and cyclones. Hence the answer is
[4].</font></p>
