Puzzle !
-----------------------------------
Junta can post puzzle in this section, here is from my side.

You are in a room with 2 doors leading out. Behind 1 door is a coffer
overflowing with jewels and gold, along with an exit. Behind the
other door is an enormous, hungry lion that will pounce on anyone
opening the door. You do not know which door leads to the treasure
and exit, and which door leads to the lion. In the room you are in
are 2 individuals. The first is a knight, who always tells the truth,
and a knave, who always lies. Both of these individuals know what is
behind each door. You do not know which individual is the knight, or
which one is the knave. You may ask one of the individuals exactly 1
question. What should you ask in order to be certain that you will
open the door with the coffer behind it, instead of the hungry lion?

Hmm.........i wud have asked anyone of them that...if i ask the Next person that from which door i may exit....then in all cases the answer will point to the same door..

let us see How.......
1) if i ask the Knight that " if i ask the next person ( knave) abt the door which leads to exit then what wud be his answer?" 
and his answer will be the wrong one...the door which has lion behind it.

2) if i ask the same Q to knave then also.....as he tells lie.....he also wud have pointed the wrong door.


so our result will be the next door.........

solution no.:1
the two boys are half-brothers i.e. born to two different wives of the same man

solution no.:2
you have specified the same day of the year and not the same day of the same month of the same year.this may be interprated as being two different mondays of say,january and december properly separated by the gestation period of 270 days for human beings.

here goes the puzzle:
The director of a circus has decided to add a new performance, the monkey dance, to his show. 
The monkey dance is danced simultaneously by 21 monkeys.
There are 21 circles drawn on the ground, and in the beginning, each monkey sits on a different circle.
There are 21 arrows drawn from circle to circle in such a way that exactly one arrow starts and exactly one arrow ends in each circle. No arrow can both begin and end at the same circle. 

When the show begins, the monkeys dance in their circles until the ringmaster blows his whistle. At each whistle blow, the monkeys simultaneously jump from their circles to the next, following the arrows. The dance ends when all the monkeys have returned to the circles where they initially started. 

The director wishes the dance to last as long as possible. What is the maximum number of whistle blows he can make before the dance ends?

BUT WITH A PRIZE THIS TIME :mg: 
"You've been placed on a course of expensive medication in which you are to take one tablet of medicine A and one tablet of medicine B daily. 
You must be careful that you take just one of each because taking more of either can have serious side effects. Taking an A without taking a B, or vice versa, can also be very serious, because they must be taken together in order to be effective. In summary, you must take exactly one of the A pills and one of the B pills at one time. 

Therefore, you open up the A bottle, and you tap one A pill into your hand. You put that bottle aside and you open the B bottle. You do the same, but by mistake, two Bs fall into your hand with the A pill. 

Now, here's the problem. You weren't watching your hand as the pills fell into it, so you can't tell the A pill apart from the two B pills. The pills look identical. They are the same size, same weight, same color, same everything, and they are not marked differently in any way. What are you going to do? You cannot tell which pill is which, and you cannot afford to throw them away and start over again. 

How do you get your daily dose of exactly one A and exactly one B without wasting any of the pills?"

soryy for the late posting but came up with another ans:
this question could be posed to any one of them pointing to one of the doors, "If I had asked you whether this door leads to the lion what would you have answered?"

the ques's quite similar to the one in 'Shakuntala Devi's puzzles', abt 'red men' and 'green men'.

Here's one from me:
There are 3 students A, B and C sitting in a circle. The teacher has 5 dots(sort of bindis) with her, 3 white ones and 2 black. The teacher asks all of them to close their eyes and then she sticks one white dot each to each of their foreheads. Now they are asked to open their eyes. 
They are sitting such that all of them face each other. Each one can watch the dots on the other two's foreheads but not on their own. Neither are they allowed to know of the color of the dots the teacher is left out with. 
Now if they are to prove themselves clever they are to say the color of the dot on their own forehead. After a while one of them(let's say B) proves herself clever by being able to rightly ans the color of her dot, i.e. white. The ques is what was the train of her thought? How could she logically arrive to that conclusion?

Re: Puzzle !
-----------------------------------
Here's one from me:
There are 3 students A, B and C sitting in a circle. The teacher has 5 dots(sort of bindis) with her, 3 white ones and 2 black. The teacher asks all of them to close their eyes and then she sticks one white dot each to each of their foreheads. Now they are asked to open their eyes. 
They are sitting such that all of them face each other. Each one can watch the dots on the other two's foreheads but not on their own. Neither are they allowed to know of the color of the dots the teacher is left out with. 
Now if they are to prove themselves clever they are to say the color of the dot on their own forehead. After a while one of them(let's say B) proves herself clever by being able to rightly ans the color of her dot, i.e. white. The ques is what was the train of her thought? How could she logically arrive to that conclusion?

See,
1. if two of them had black dots the third one will know that he has white instantly
2. if any one of them had a black dot at head, then the other two should have concluded togethar after some time...(coz they will wait for the other white dot to conclude...) as if the case is 1 the other white dot will conclude instantly else he will wait....
3. if all of them have white, then they will take more time....as all of them will think that case may be 2....and after some time...they will realize everyone has white....

PS : The prerequisite for the occurance of the solution is that not only B but all have to be clever enough to realize this solution :mg:

B might have seen 2 black dots on the foreheads of the other two ppl, so she must have concluded that she has a white one on her fore head :mg: 
By the way, do the three know that the teacher originally had 3white and 2 black dots??

The prob clearly states that the teacher sticks a white dot on each of their foreheads.

I forgot to mention, the students knew that the teacher had 3w and 2b dots with her. I thought that went unsaid. anyways....

Here's another:
There are 'n' number of factories producing 'n' different kinds of products. One factory produces only one single kind. The products of a kind are identical to each other in all respects(weight, size, color, etc... ). Now it is known that one of these factories produce a faulty product whose weight doesn't match with the original weight the product is supposed to be having. You are given a digital weighing machine and asked to find out the factory producing the faulty products in just 2 weighings.
Assumptions:
1. u know the original weight the products are supposed to be having.
2. the digital weighing machine is large enough to be capable of weighing infinitely heavy objects.

This one's actually quite famous but just in case u guys haven't heard of it.

Now a Puzzle from my side...

PRIZE MONEY : BUMPER BONUS === 10,000 Points

the problem is to join 8 points lying on a surface to one another using lines ( straight or curvilinear) so that none of the joining lines intersect any other.

as the prospective solvers will note immediately, this is not possible on a plane  or on the surface of a sphere( which can be opened to become a plane).so the first part of the problem goes in finding the suitable surface. <<< 8000 Points >>>> upto this mark.
 :mg: 
2000 points for actually joining the 8 points on that surface .SURFACE

I'm sorry I'll have to differ with u.
If that is what we do we'd get the resulting value as =>   i(x-x')  [x being the weight of the original product and x' being the faulty)
But we wouldn't know which i's multiple the product is. For example if the product is 15 it could be 3(5) or 5(3) or 1(15) .....
Nevertheless, u are very close to the sol. give it another try.

QUESTION

You are in a room with 2 doors leading out. Behind 1 door is a coffer
overflowing with jewels and gold, along with an exit. Behind the
other door is an enormous, hungry lion that will pounce on anyone
opening the door. You do not know which door leads to the treasure
and exit, and which door leads to the lion. In the room you are in
are 2 individuals. The first is a knight, who always tells the truth,
and a knave, who always lies. Both of these individuals know what is
behind each door. You do not know which individual is the knight, or
which one is the knave. You may ask one of the individuals exactly 1
question. What should you ask in order to be certain that you will
open the door with the coffer behind it, instead of the hungry lion?


ANSWER

Ask the knight *OR* the knave which door would the other individual
point to if I asked him which door led to the lion and I would step
through that specific door.

If I ask the knave which door would the knight say is the door with
the lion, I would through the door that the knave said the knight
said is the door to the lion because that is actually the door with
the treasure.

If I asked the knight, the kniwght would know that the knave would
lie about the door with the lion behind it and point to the door with
the treasure.

Either way it is the treasure that is pointed to.

There is a monkey hanging by a branch of a tree. And there is a hunter
with his gun looking for a kill. The hunter spots the monkey, takes aim
with the help of the laser pointer on the gun, and fires at the monkey.
At that very precise moment (the moment that the shot is fired), the
monkey lets go of the tree branch and starts his free fall towards the
ground. Will the monkey dodge the bullet and survive this incident?

Height of monkey from ground - h, distance of hunter from base of tree -
d, Velocity of bullet - v, and acceleration due to gravity - g. Can
assume monkey to be point object, or of height h1, whichever way you
prefer your monkeys.

The moment that the shot is fired = the time when the bullet starts its
motion, and is not to be interpreted as the time when the monkey heard
the shot. So velocity of sound does not come into play.

hey luckynawabs,

the monkey cannot escape the shot, even though it leaves the branch and falls down..
b coz the force of gravitation is same on both the bullet and the monkey and the bullet doesnot take a straight line path, but a parabolic path.....

so, the monkey cannot escape

i guess no, the monkey will not survive the incident cuz. the speed of bullet is very very very much higher than the speed of the monkey.

No the monkey wont be able to escape at as both the bullet and monkey are being dragged down by gravity and also bullets are always aimed higher than the actual target, since they have a tendencay to hit below the aimed target.

quite simply, the efect of gravity remains the same on both the bodies. so the monkey is dead. it might have stayed alive if it hadnt jumped. ironic.

monkey problem
1. The gravitational force acts only in the vertical direction
2. Acceleration due to gravity is the same for both monkey and bullet

So, in the vertical direction, monkey and bullet fall by the same
amount in the same time (for the bullet the falling is superimposed
on the straight line trajectory it would have taken had there not
been any gravity) and the bullet therefore hit the monkey.

It was Einstein who originally showed that being accelerated is equivalent to
being in a gravitational field (apologies to any mathematicians and physicists
present - this is simplified but basically correct!).

Ans for the puzzle 
There is a car with a very flat roof, on a level road.  ..Assume windows are 
closed, and ...the wind from outside.

So just as on the Earth a helium balloon will rise UP (i.e. opposed to the force
of gravity) because the surrounding air is heavier, so too will it move to the
front of the car, for the same reason.

Banana Puzzle...?


there were three guys and a bunch of banannas from
a tree that they all picked together. they were tired at the end of
the day and decided to sleep first and then divide the bannannas
equally between them. in the middle of the night one guy wakes up and
says "i dont trust them, i will divide it myself and take my share
now." so he did. but when he finished dividing into 3 evenly there
was an extra banana so he gave it to a monkey and took his share. the
second one woke up and did the same thing. again there was an extra
banana. again he gave it to a monkey. the third one woke and same
story happened. in the morning when all 3 woke they all dicided to
keep what they did in the middle of the night quiet and divide the
bananas again. so they did and again there was an extra banana which
thay gave to a monkey. how many bananas were there?

A sportive young hare and a tortoise raced in opposite directions around a circular track that was 100 yards in diameter. They started at the same spot, but the hare did not move until the tortoise had a start of one eighth of the distance (that is, the circumference of the circle). The hare held such a poor opinion of the other's racing ability that he sauntered along, nibbling the grass until he met the tortoise. At this point the hare had gone one sixth of the distance.

How many times faster than he went before must the hare now run in order to win the race?

A sportive young hare and a tortoise raced in opposite directions around a circular track that was 100 yards in diameter. They started at the same spot, but the hare did not move until the tortoise had a start of one eighth of the distance (that is, the circumference of the circle). The hare held such a poor opinion of the other's racing ability that he sauntered along, nibbling the grass until he met the tortoise. At this point the hare had gone one sixth of the distance. 

at the pont where hare meets the tortoise it has to go another 5/6 of the distance while the tortise has to go just 1/6 of the distance so hare has to move at a speed of greater than 5 times the speed of the tortoise to win the race.

The radius of the base of a right circular cone
is 1. The vertex of the cone is V, and P is a point
on the circumference of the base. The length of PV is 6 and the midpoint of PV is M. A piece of string is attached to M and wound tightly twice round the
cone finishing at P. What is length of the string?

Re: Puzzle !

Hi Guys,
These are some puzzles from shakuntala devi which I wasnt able to solve as well as unable to understand the solution,maybe I am missing some easy trick.Please show the detailed steps for solving the following probs.

1A,B,C,D,E,F and G  are supposed to play a game,in which the player who wins the game is supposed to give the players just as much money as they had already in their pockets.
They all palyed seven games and strangely,each won a game in turn in the order in which their names are given.But what was more strange was that when they had finished the game each of the seven had exactly the same amount,Rs 32 in his his pocket.
Can you find out how much money each person had with him before they began the game.

2.I entered a store and spent one-half of the money that was in my purse.When I came out I found that I had just as many paise as I had rupees and half as many rupees as I had paise when I went in.
How much money did I have with me when I entered?

there is no unique ans as it is a ratio prop prob how ever to find min ans find the eqution
here it is

(100x+y)/2=x+50y where x is the no of Rs and y the no of paise
solvin we get

98x=99y hence the min such val as x&y r relatively prime r 99,98

hence ans is 99rs 98 paise

the first prob can be solved using back propagation or bottom up principle though very time cons so not solving

You have 13 balls,all of the same size and color. One of the 13 balls is of abnormal weight ( either light or heavier). You do not know which one. In max 3 weighings, how can you tell which ball is of abnormal weight. Also you do not know the weight of each ball.

[quote="luckynawabs"]How many students do you need in a class before the probability of having 2 ppl with the same bday exceeds half?

*** You require 22 people. (For probability = 0.5). 23 people to be on the safer side. 

You have 13 balls,all of the same size and color. One of the 13 balls is of abnormal weight ( either light or heavier). You do not know which one. In max 3 weighings, how can you tell which ball is of abnormal weight. Also you do not know the weight of each ball.

*** You cannot find out the ball in 3 weighings unless you are given a ball which can be used for reference. This can be proven mathematically.

 yup u can..

 Divide the 13 balls into 2 sets of 6 each and weigh them against each other

 There are 2 possibilities:
 
 1) One of the set is heavier which means tht set has the abnormal ball .... so divide the set with the abnormal ball into 2 sets again this time 3 balls in each set and weigh them against each other

  2) The sets are equal in weight and thus the 13th ball which doesnt take part in the weighing is the abnormal ball

  1A)  if the ab. ball is in one of the sets divide that set into 2 sets of 3 balls each and weigh them against each other .. continue the same way by sub-dividin into 2 sets of 1 ball each ....

 thus in atmost 3 weighings the odd ball can be found

 There is a general formula for this if sumone cud highlight it...

But u do not know whether the ab ball is heavier or lighter than the original ones. In that case u cannot say whether the ab. ball is in the heavier set of balls or the lighter ones.

divide the balls in to groups of 4,4,5 balls each
weight 4,4 groups

case 1:The sets are equal in weight  
1a)thus the abnormal ball lies in the group of 5
1b)weight 3 correct balls in one pan n 3 from the group of 5 balls. 
->if the scale tilts then the fake ball is among the 3 and u'll get to know if its heavier or lighter
put 1 ball from those 3 balls in each pan. if they balance, the abnormal is the one left out . or if the scale tilts,  the fake ball is the heavier one or the lighter one as the case may be.
--> if the scales do not tilt then the fake ball is among the 2 balls left out 
 put then one each on the pan, n find out 

case 2: the scales tilt. 

put 2 balls from the heavier side and 1 ball from lighter side in each pan, and weight them.
--> if the scale doesnt tilt,the abnormal ball is out the two left out lighter balls. weight them n find out 
-->if the scale tilts,the abnormal ball is the heavy one on the heavy side or the light one on the light side. 
find that out by measuring the two heavy balls, if they balance , the abnormal ball is the lighter ball on the lighter side
if they tilt, then abnormal ball is the heavier of the two heavy ball

whew !! it was a good one

I can see some flaw in your reasoning. Light and heavy interwined too often to confuse the reader :-)

Well, on second thoughts it seems correct to me. Had been better if u use numbers on balls.

Good solution!

Re: Puzzle !
-----------------------------------
Hi,

Formula to find out if you can find the odd ball in a given set of balls :

If n weighings are allowed, we can find the odd ball among (3^n - 3)/2 identical balls.

So, for 3 weighings, the maximum number of balls can be 12. If you want to add another ball to the set, you require a reference ball. 
So, if you have a reference ball, in n weighings, we can find the odd ball from a set of ((3^n - 3)/2) + 1 balls.

You can check this formula for other combinations of these type of problems.

So, the solution will not be possible without the reference ball.

I will post the proof later. 

Regards

Solve them :-

1. There are 25 horses and in what min no of races can u find top three of them
The constraints are that in one race u can race 5 of the horses and u dont have a timer...

2. A camel has 3000 banans, he has to take those from A to B and B is 1000 miles away from A
The camel can take 1000 bananas with him at a time and for every mile it needs one banana to eat...
What max no of bananas can it take to B...

Do it like the olympics...have heats and then a final.
6 races!

2. A camel has 3000 bananas, he has to take those from A to B and B is 1000 miles away from A; The camel can take 1000 bananas with him at a time and for every mile it needs one banana to eat....What max no of bananas can it take to B...

ANS: The camel may carry bananas part-way, drop off a supply of bananas, walk back to start (make sure the camel still has enough bananas to do this!), re-boost his supply, and so on. Following a method of this ilk it is possible to get OVER 500 bananas to market. 

EG. Take a 1000, go 250 drop 500 and back x 2 times
The third time, take 1000, drop 750 and eat 250 (bananas = 1750)
now, take a 1750, go to town, youve got 1000 left. Enjoy the bananas!

Bhaiyaa? :P :roll:

Almost forgot i posted puzzles here :mg:
Here are the solutions :)

1. There are 25 horses and in what min no of races can u find top three of them 
The constraints are that in one race u can race 5 of the horses and u dont have a timer...

divide 25 horses in 5 groups for 5 races...
Now take toppers of all the races for another race....6th Race
Now in this race the 4th and 5th are out because we want only top 3....
2nd and 3rd of the group of third horse in 6th race are also out...as they will have position lower than 3 in 25 horses togethar...
3rd horse of the group of second horse in 6th race is also out for same reason...
take tooper of 6th race out as this will be topper of all 25 horses...

Now we have 5 horses and we want top 2 of them....1 more race :)

Ans 7 races minimum....

2. A camel has 3000 banans, he has to take those from A to B and B is 1000 miles away from A 
The camel can take 1000 bananas with him at a time and for every mile it needs one banana to eat... 
What max no of bananas can it take to B...

Camel will need 5 bananas to transfer all the bananas 1 mile away...
5 as for 1st 1000 he'll go n come back then for another 1000 he'll go n come back but for last 1000 he'll only go as nothing will be left behind...

For second mile too it'll take 5 bananas...

Now it'll require 5 bananas per mile for total banana count > 2000
and for banana count < 2000 it'll eat 3 bananas...

and for < 1000 it'll eat 1 banana....

so 1st 1000 bananas will be finished in 1000/5 = 200 Miles
next 1000 in 1000/3 = 334 Miles...

Finaly he'll have 1000 bananas and 466 miles to go...

At B camel will have 534 bananas :)
